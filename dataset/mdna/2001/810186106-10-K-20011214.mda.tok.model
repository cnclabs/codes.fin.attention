item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scotts is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care and professional horticulture in the united states and europe 
during fiscal  our operations were divided into three business segments north american consumer  global professional and international consumer 
the north american consumer segment includes the lawns  gardens  growing media  ortho  scotts lawnservice r and canada businesses 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  we focus on our consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  to create demand to pull products through the retail distribution channels 
in the past three years  we have spent approximately of our gross sales annually on media advertising to support and promote our products and brands 
we have applied this consumer marketing focus over the past several years  and we believe that scotts continues to receive a significant return on these marketing expenditures 
we expect that we will continue to focus our marketing efforts toward the consumer and to make a significant investment in consumer marketing expenditures in the future to drive market share and sales growth 
in fiscal  we began two major initiatives that affect the way we go to business with our customers in our north american consumer business segment 
one was the one face to the customer initiative whereby the separate sales forces under our previous business unit structure were combined into a single  centrally managed and coordinated sales force 
the other major initiative was the reduction in the number of  and amount of business we do through distributors 
the end objective of these initiatives was to improve the service levels and relationships with our customers in north america 
while we generally believe that these initiatives were successful in fiscal  and are important to our future success  they did have the effect of increasing some costs in  such as selling expenses  and further complicated order processing and fulfillment in an environment where we were also going live on our new erp system in two significant businesses lawns and ortho 
scotts sales are seasonal in nature and are susceptible to global weather conditions  primarily in north america and europe 
for instance  periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales but can increase demand for pesticide sales 
periods of dry  hot weather can have the opposite effect on fertilizer and pesticide sales 
we believe that the acquisitions we have made over the past several years diversify both our product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
in fiscal  we expanded our reach of product line offerings into the controls segment with the acquisition of the ortho r brand of control products from monsanto and the execution of the roundup r marketing agreement 
in addition  over the past several years  we have made several acquisitions to strengthen our international market position in the lawn and garden category including rhone poulenc jardin  asef holding bv and  most recently  substral 
each acquisition provided a significant addition to our then existing european platform and strengthened our foothold in the continental european consumer lawn and garden market 
through these acquisitions  we have established a strong presence in france  germany  austria and the benelux countries 
these acquisitions may also mitigate  to a certain extent  our susceptibility to weather conditions by expanding the regions in which we operate 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of income and expense as a percentage of net sales for the three years ended september  fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit commission earned from marketing agreement  net advertising and promotion selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles restructuring and other charges other income  net income from operations interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt net income dividends on class a convertible preferred stock income applicable to common shareholders the following table sets forth net sales by business segment for the three years ended september  millions north american consumer lawns gardens growing media ortho scotts lawnservice r canada other total    international consumer global professional consolidated    fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were  million  an increase of over fiscal sales of  million 
as discussed below  net sales increased over in the north american consumer segment  whereas  net sales declined by in the international consumer segment and global professional net sales were flat 
north american consumer net sales were  million in fiscal  an increase of over fiscal net sales of  million 
net sales in the lawns business within this segment were million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal net sales of million  primarily due to the introduction of a new line of grass seed products 
net sales in the growing media business increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal saw the continuation of the successful roll out of the value added line of miracle gro r branded garden and potting soils in the growing media business 
sales of branded soils increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net sales in the ortho business decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the weather and product availability issues due to erp system data problems 
net sales in the scotts lawnservice r business increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this growth reflects continued expansion through acquisitions and new branch openings  as well as the success of our direct marketing campaign utilizing the scotts r brand name 
the other sales category consists of sales under a supply agreement to the purchaser of the proturf r business in and actual sales of the proturf r business in fiscal prior to the date of sale 
selling price changes were not material to net sales in fiscal or fiscal international consumer net sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the adverse impact of changes in exchange rates  net sales for international consumer increased over compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales is primarily due to the successful sell in of a new line of fertilizer products under the substral r brand name acquired january  net sales for global professional of million for fiscal were flat with fiscal net sales of million 
excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  global professional net sales increased approximately year over year 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding restructuring charges  gross profit was flat year over year 
gross profit  including restructuring charges  as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by unfavorable product mix in the ortho and gardens businesses and increased sales of seed which has a lower margin than fertilizers and control products  offset by lower distribution costs and the favorable margin impact from the value added growing media products 
the net commission earned from marketing agreement in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal despite worldwide earnings for the consumer roundup r business increasing by approximately million from fiscal to fiscal  the gross commission earned by scotts was flat due to the increased earnings targets and reduced commission rate schedule in the commission calculation for as compared to in addition  the net commission decreased due to the million increase in contribution expenses as specified in the agreement 
advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million from fiscal advertising and promotion expenses of million 
this decrease reflects the impact of improved media buying efficiencies and lower advertising rates compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  over similar expenses in fiscal of million 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from the prior year is partially due to an increase in selling expenses as a result of the change in the selling and distribution model for the north american consumer businesses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is also due to an increase in information technology expenses from the prior year as a result of the cost of many information technology resources being capitalized toward the cost of our enterprise resource planning system in fiscal and the increased depreciation on the new erp system in fiscal most of these information technology resources have assumed a system support function that is now being expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses associated with restructuring and other non operating expenses were million for fiscal these charges  along with the million which is included in cost of sales for the write off of inventory  were primarily associated with the closure or relocation of certain plants and administrative facilities 
included in the million charge in selling  general and administrative costs is million to write down to fair value certain property and equipment and other assets  million of facility exit costs  million of severance costs  and million in other restructuring and other costs 
the severance costs related to reduction in force initiatives and facility closures and consolidations in north america and europe covering approximately administrative  production  selling and other employees 
severance costs are expected to be paid in fiscal with some payments extending into all other fiscal restructuring related activities and costs are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal the company expects these restructuring activities to result in expense savings of nearly million in fiscal after reinvesting some of the savings to grow our brands in our international businesses 
in fiscal  the company expects to recognize additional restructuring and other charges  primarily for relocation costs for equipment  personnel and inventory which must be expensed when incurred 
additional restructuring costs may be incurred in fiscal as our review and evaluation of our facilities and processes is an ongoing exercise aimed at achieving improved returns on invested capital 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the additional amortization related to the substral acquisition in december and numerous small acquisitions by scotts lawnservice r throughout fiscal in fiscal  scotts will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which is expected to result in a reduction in amortization expense in fiscal and future years 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in other income was primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain legal matters in the current year and an insurance settlement from a seed warehouse fire 
the prior year results also included losses on the sale of miscellaneous assets which did not recur in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the decrease was the result of the current year restructuring and other charges and increased selling  general and administrative costs  the decline in the marketing agreement net commission and higher depreciation expense for the new erp system which was fully in service for all of fiscal for segment reporting purposes  earnings before interest  taxes and amortization is used as the measure for income from operations or operating income 
on that basis  operating income in the north american consumer segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in sales offset by lower margins due to mix and higher expenses for selling and the new erp system 
operating income in the global professional segment declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to lower sales due to weather and higher operating costs in the international professional business 
the operating cost structure in the international professional business was addressed in the restructuring initiatives undertaken in late fiscal international consumer segment operating income declined from income of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal excluding restructuring charges  international consumer reported operating income of million 
the decline in income was due to lower sales due to poor weather in europe and higher operating costs 
the international consumer cost structure was also addressed in s restructuring initiatives 
the corporate operating loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to restructuring charges related to the domestic business 
interest expense for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal interest expense of million 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to favorable interest rates 
the average rate on our variable rate debt was in fiscal compared to in fiscal income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared to for fiscal the primary driver of the change in the effective tax rate was the restructuring and other charges recorded in fiscal  which reduced pre tax income thereby increasing the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization on the effective tax rate 
also  the prior year effective tax rate benefited from the elimination of tax reserves due to the settlement of certain tax contingencies 
net income was million for fiscal  or 
per common share on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis 
common shares and equivalents used in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the increase reflects more common share equivalents due to higher average stock prices and additional option grants to associates in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were  million  an increase of over fiscal net sales of  million 
on a pro forma basis  assuming that the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin acquisitions had occurred on october   net sales for fiscal were higher than pro forma net sales for fiscal the increase in net sales from year to year was driven by significant increases in net sales across all businesses in the north american consumer segment  partially offset by decreases in net sales in the international consumer segment as discussed below 
north american consumer net sales  excluding consumer other were  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over net sales for fiscal of  million 
net sales in the lawns business increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to a significant increase in sales to and consumer takeaway from national home centers 
net sales in the gardens business increased million  or  primarily driven by strong net sales and market share performance in the water soluble and tree spikes product lines and the successful introduction of new products such as the miracle gro r garden weed preventer tm line in fiscal net sales in the growing media business increased million  or  due to strong category and market share growth  particularly for value added products such as miracle gro r potting soils 
sales in the ortho business increased million  or  on an actual basis and million  or  on a pro forma basis  reflecting significantly improved volume with home center retailers and improved category and market share performance on the selective weed control product lines 
net sales for the ortho business were negatively impacted by the voluntary product return program for the registered pesticide ortho r home defense r indoor outdoor insect killer  sold with the pull n spray r pump dispenser  the phasing out of products containing the active ingredient chlorpyrifos and reduced selling efforts by a primary distributor prior to its termination on september  consumer other net sales were the net sales of the proturf r business that was sold in may selling price changes did not have a significant impact on net sales in the north american consumer segment for fiscal global professional segment net sales of million in fiscal were million  or above fiscal net sales of million 
international consumer segment net sales of million in fiscal were million lower than net sales for fiscal of million 
excluding the adverse impact of changes in exchange rates  net sales for the international consumer segment increased nearly compared to the prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to improved results in the segment s continental european consumer businesses partially offset by decreases in the segment s uk consumer business caused by significant product rationalization and unusually poor weather 
gross profit increased to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal gross profit of million  driven by the increase in year to date net sales discussed above and a slight increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for fiscal compared to of net sales for fiscal this increase in profitability on net sales was driven by a shift to direct distribution to certain retail accounts  improved product mix toward higher margin  value added products and improved efficiencies in scotts production plants  offset by increased urea  fuel and other raw material costs and a significant erosion in the profitability of the proturf r business prior to its sale 
the gross commission from marketing agreement in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the increase in the gross commission from year to year was driven by significantly higher sales of consumer roundup r worldwide year over year 
contribution expenses under marketing agreement were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in contribution expenses was due to an increase in the contribution payment to monsanto and an increase of million in the amortization of the million marketing fee paid to monsanto as a result of correcting the amortization period from to years 
the million of additional amortization represents the additional amortization of million that was not recognized in fiscal and additional amortization of million for fiscal advertising expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of over fiscal advertising expenses of million 
promotion expenses are presented as a reduction of net sales 
promotion expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales before deduction for promotion expenses  combined advertising and promotion spending increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to continued emphasis on increasing advertising and promotion expenses to drive revenue growth within the north american consumer segment and investments in advertising and promotion to drive future sales growth in the international consumer segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  an increase of over fiscal expenses of million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to additional costs needed to support the increased net sales levels in the north american consumer businesses  infrastructure expenses within the international consumer segment  selling  general and administrative expenses for the ortho business which were not incurred in the first quarter of fiscal due to the timing of the acquisition in january  and increased legal costs as a result of the various legal matters discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal amortization of million 
this increase was primarily due to fiscal not reflecting a full year of amortization related to the ortho acquisition since the acquisition occurred in january restructuring and other charges were million in fiscal these charges represent severance costs associated with the reorganization of the north american professional business group to strengthen distribution and technical sales support  integrate brand management across market segments and reduce annual operating expenses 
substantially all payments have been made as of september  there were no restructuring charges incurred in fiscal other income in fiscal was million compared to other income of million in the prior year 
the increase in other income  on a net basis  was primarily due to the million gain resulting from the sale of the proturf r business  partially offset by costs incurred in connection with scotts voluntary return program for the registered pesticide ortho r home defense r indoor outdoor insect killer  sold with the pull n spray r pump dispenser and additional losses on disposals of miscellaneous fixed assets 
income from operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in income from operations was due primarily to the increase in net sales across the north american consumer businesses as noted above  partially offset by the decrease in net sales due to the sale of the proturf r business 
interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal interest expense of million 
the increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings to fund the ortho acquisition and an increase in average borrowing rates under our credit facility  partially offset by reduced working capital requirements 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
scotts effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to for the previous year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal is due primarily to a reversal of million of tax reserves upon resolution of certain outstanding tax matters during the third quarter of fiscal and a reduction in the base tax rate for the year  before reversal of reserves  to 
in conjunction with the ortho acquisition  in january  scotts completed an offering of million of senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds from this offering  together with borrowings under our credit facility  were used to fund the ortho acquisition and repurchase approximately of the then outstanding million of senior subordinated notes due august we recorded an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of the notes of million  including a call premium of million and the write off of unamortized issuance costs and discounts of million 
scotts reported net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis 
the diluted earnings per share for fiscal is net of a one time reduction of per share resulting from the early conversion of class a convertible preferred stock in october the diluted earnings per share for fiscal is net of a per share charge associated with the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the seasonal nature of our operations generally requires cash to fund significant increases in working capital primarily inventory and accounts receivable during the first and second quarters 
the third fiscal quarter is a period for collecting accounts receivable and liquidating inventory levels 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to the prior year was due to higher levels of inventory at september  compared to september   due  in part  to the move by major retailers to reduce inventory investments and lower than anticipated net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the additional cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to the million in payments toward the purchase of the substral r business discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included in item  and other payments made toward several lawn service acquisitions during fiscal partially offset by reduced capital spending in fiscal capital spending was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in line with our ongoing efforts to improve return on invested capital  capital spending in fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
financing activities provided cash of million for fiscal compared to using cash of million in the prior year 
the increase in cash from financing activities was primarily due to an increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund operating and investing activities during fiscal total debt was million as of september   an increase of million compared with debt at september  of million 
the increase in debt compared to the prior year was primarily due to additional borrowings to fund operating and investing activities as discussed above and seller notes from the substral r and scotts lawnservice r acquisitions in fiscal our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
the credit facility provides for borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of billion and consists of term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
borrowings outstanding under the term loan facilities and revolving credit facility were million and million  respectively at september  in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions on or prior to september  as of september   we repurchased  common shares  at a cost of million  under this program 
in october  the board of directors approved the cancellation of the third year commitment of million under the share repurchase program 
the board did authorize repurchasing the amount still outstanding under the second year repurchase commitment approximately million through september  share repurchases are subject to the covenants contained in our credit facility or our other debt instruments 
repurchased shares are held in treasury and will be used for the exercise of employee stock options and for other valid corporate purposes 
we believe cash flows from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to meet debt service and working capital needs during fiscal  and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot ensure that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all  or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
at september   scotts was not in compliance with debt covenants pertaining to net worth  leverage and interest coverage 
a waiver of non compliance for these covenant violations was received in october in december  scotts amended the credit facility resulting in the elimination or resetting of certain negative and affirmative covenants 
see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and believe we are operating in substantial compliance with  or taking actions aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
we are involved in several legal actions with various governmental agencies related to environmental matters 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
however  there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
additional information on environmental matters affecting us is provided in item business environmental and regulatory considerations  item business regulatory actions and item legal proceedings 
enterprise resource planning erp in july  we announced a project designed to bring our information systems resources in line with our current strategic objectives 
the project included the redesign of certain key business processes in connection with the installation of new software 
sap was selected as the primary software provider for this project 
as of october   all of the north american businesses with the exception of canada were operating under the new system 
the implementation of the canadian system began during the third quarter of fiscal and was substantially complete by october  through september   we spent approximately million on the project  approximately of which has been capitalized and is being amortized over a period of four to eight years 
we are currently evaluating when  and to what extent  the new information systems and applications will be implemented at our international locations 
euro a new currency called the euro has been introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
we are assessing the impact the emu formation and euro implementation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
over million of the costs associated with this work was incurred during fiscal some costs will likely be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal and beyond as well but are not expected to be material 
management s outlook results for fiscal were below management s expectations 
weather  the economy  retailer initiatives to reduce their inventory investment and our own product availability issues combined to make fiscal less profitable than fiscal we believe we are aggressively addressing ways to improve profitability of our business by the restructuring steps we took in late fiscal to reduce headcount and rationalize the supply chain  sales and administrative organizations in north america and europe 
this process will continue in fiscal and beyond 
we also will continue to look for opportunities to bring new products into the marketplace and profitably expand our scotts lawnservice r business 
looking forward  we maintain the following broad tenets to our strategic plan promote and capitalize on the strengths of the scotts r  miracle gro r  hyponex r and ortho r industry leading brands  as well as our portfolio of powerful brands in our international markets 
this involves a commitment to our retail partners that we will support these brands through advertising and promotion unequaled in the lawn and garden consumables market 
in the professional categories  it signifies a commitment to customers to provide value as an integral element in their long term success  commit to continuously study and improve knowledge of the market  the consumer and the competition  simplify product lines and business processes  to focus on those that deliver value  evaluate marginal ones and eliminate those that lack future prospects  and achieve world leadership in operations  leveraging technology and know how to deliver outstanding customer service and quality 
we anticipate that we can deliver significant revenue and earnings growth through emphasis on executing our strategic plan 
we believe that we can generate annual sales growth of to in our core businesses and annual earnings growth of at least 
in addition  we have targeted improving our return on invested capital 
we believe that we can achieve our goal of realizing a return on our invested capital commensurate with the average return on invested capital for our consumer products peer group in the next three to four years 
we expect to achieve this goal by reducing overhead spending  tightening capital spending controls  implementing return on capital measures into our incentive compensation plans and accelerating operating performance and gross margin improvements utilizing our new erp capabilities in north america 
forward looking statements we have made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our summary annual report  our financial statements and other information booklet  in this form k and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value 
forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of that act 
the forward looking statements that we make in our summary annual report  in our financial statements and other information booklet  in this form k and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements 
adverse weather conditions could adversely impact financial results 
weather conditions in north america and europe have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales 
periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales  while periods of dry  hot weather can decrease pesticide sales 
in addition  an abnormally cold spring throughout north america and or europe could adversely affect both fertilizer and pesticide sales and therefore our financial results 
our historical seasonality could impair our ability to pay obligations as they come due and operating expenses 
because our products are used primarily in the spring and summer  our business is highly seasonal 
for the past two fiscal years  approximately to of our net sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined 
our working capital needs and our borrowings peak near the middle of our second fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand is insufficient to pay our obligations as they come due  including interest payments on our indebtedness  or our operating expenses  at a time when we are unable to draw on our credit facility  this seasonality could have a material adverse affect on our ability to conduct our business 
adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
if we fail to comply with any of the financial or other restrictive covenants of our indebtedness  our indebtedness could become due and payable in full prior to its stated due date 
we cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash  which we may not be able to generate 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all 
we also cannot assure that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
public perceptions that the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us 
we manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products  such as fertilizers  growing media  herbicides and pesticides  bearing one of our brands 
on occasion  customers and some current or former employees have alleged that some products failed to perform up to expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property 
public perception that our products are not safe  whether justified or not  could impair our reputation  damage our brand names and materially adversely affect our business 
because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers  the loss of one or more of our top customers could adversely affect our financial results 
our top north american retail customers together accounted for approximately of our fiscal year net sales and of our outstanding accounts receivable as of september  our top four customers  home depot  wal mart  kmart and lowe s represented approximately   and  respectively  of our fiscal year net sales 
these customers hold significant positions in the retail lawn and garden market 
the loss of  or reduction in orders from  home depot  wal mart  kmart  lowe s or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results  as could customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products  we would lose a substantial source of future earnings 
if we were to commit a serious default under the marketing agreement with monsanto for consumer roundup r products  monsanto may have the right to terminate the agreement 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement rightfully  we would not be entitled to any termination fee  and we would lose all  or a significant portion  of the significant source of earnings we believe the marketing agreement provides 
monsanto may also be able to terminate the marketing agreement within a given region  including north america  without paying us a termination fee if sales to consumers in that region decline over a cumulative three fiscal year period  or by more than for each of two consecutive fiscal years 
the expiration of patents relating to roundup r and the scotts turf builder r line of products could substantially increase our competition in the united states 
glyphosate  the active ingredient in roundup r  was subject to a patent in the united states that expired in september we cannot predict the success of roundup r now that glyphosate is no longer patented 
substantial new competition in the united states could adversely affect us 
glyphosate is no longer subject to patent in europe and is not subject to patent in canada 
while sales of roundup r in such countries have continued to increase despite the lack of patent protection  sales in the united states may decline as a result of increased competition 
any such decline in sales would adversely affect our financial results through the reduction of commissions as calculated under the roundup r marketing agreement 
we are aware that spectrum brands produced glyphosate one gallon products for home depot and lowe s to be sold under the real kill r and no pest r brand names  respectively  in fiscal year we anticipate that lowe s will introduce a one quart glyphosate product  and that ace hardware corporation will introduce one gallon and one quart glyphosate products  in fiscal year it is too early to determine whether these product introductions will have a material adverse effect on our sales of roundup r 
our methylene urea product composition patent  which covered scotts turf builder r  scotts turf builder r with plus r with weed control and scotts turf builder r with halts r crabgrass preventer  expired in july and could also result in increased competition 
any decline in sales of turf builder r products after the expiration of the methylene urea product composition patent could adversely affect our financial results 
the hagedorn partnership  lp  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common shares of scotts on a fully diluted basis 
the hagedorn partnership  lp  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common shares of scotts on a fully diluted basis and has sufficient voting power to significantly influence the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders 
compliance with environmental and other public health regulations could increase our cost of doing business 
local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways 
in the united states  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the united states environmental protection agency us epa and  in many cases  similar state agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on our business 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals 
we may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
the food quality protection act  enacted by the us congress in august  establishes a standard for food use pesticides  which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under this act  the us epa is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in our products  certain of which may be used on crops processed into various food products  continue to be evaluated by the us epa as part of this exposure risk assessment 
it is possible that the us epa or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us 
for example  in june  dowagrosciences  an active ingredient registrant  voluntarily agreed to a gradual phase out of residential uses of chlorpyrifos  an active ingredient used by us in our lawn and garden products 
in december  the us epa reached agreement with various parties  including manufacturers of the active ingredient diazinon  regarding a phased withdrawal of residential uses of products containing diazinon  used also by us in our lawn and garden products 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the us epa s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in our products 
the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local  state  federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies 
regulations regarding the use of some pesticide and fertilizer products may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product  that the products be used only in specified locations or that certain ingredients not be used 
users may be required to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied and may be required to notify individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future 
even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations  we cannot assure that our products  particularly pesticide products  will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances 
the costs of compliance  remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
the harvesting of peat for our growing media business has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny 
in the united states  state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to an agreed upon condition 
in some locations  we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water 
in the united kingdom  our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of legislation 
in addition to the regulations already described  local  state  federal and foreign agencies regulate the disposal  handling and storage of waste  air and water discharges from our facilities 
in june  the ohio environmental protection agency ohio epa initiated an enforcement action against us with respect to alleged surface water violations and inadequate treatment capabilities at our marysville facility and seeking corrective action under the resource conservation recovery act 
we have met with the ohio epa and the ohio attorney general s office to negotiate an amicable resolution of these issues 
on december   an agreed judicial consent order was submitted to the union county common pleas court 
although this consent order is subject to public comment and both parties may withdraw their consent to entry of the order  we anticipate the consent order will be entered by the court in january during fiscal year  we made approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses  compared with approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses in fiscal year management anticipates that environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses for fiscal year will not differ significantly from those incurred in fiscal year the adequacy of these anticipated future expenditures is based on our operating in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations and several significant assumptions that we have identified all of the significant sites that must be remediated  that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us  and that with respect to the agreed judicial consent order in ohio  that potentially contaminated soil can be remediated in place rather than having to be removed and only specific stream segments will require remediation as opposed to the entire stream 
if there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these assumptions or if we are found not to be in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations  it could have a material impact on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the implementation of the euro currency in some european countries between and could adversely affect us 
in january  the euro was introduced in some economic and monetary union countries and by  all economic and monetary union countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
we are still assessing the impact the economic and monetary union formation and euro implementation may have on the sales of our products and conduct of our business 
we expect to take appropriate actions based on the results of our assessment 
however  there can be no assurance that this issue will not have a material adverse effect on us or our future operating results and financial condition 
our significant international operations make us more susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to the costs of international regulation 
we currently operate manufacturing  sales and service facilities outside of north america  particularly in the united kingdom  germany and france 
our international operations have increased with the acquisitions of levington  miracle garden care limited  ortho and rhone poulenc jardin and with the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products 
in fiscal year  international sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  additional costs of compliance with local regulations  and historically  higher rates of inflation than in the united states 
the costs related to our international operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial and other instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
we do not enter into transactions designed to mitigate our market risks for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have various debt instruments outstanding at september  that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
as a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments  we have entered into the following interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates a million british pounds sterling notional amount swap to convert variable rate debt obligations denominated in british pounds sterling to a fixed rate 
the exchange rate used to convert british pounds sterling to us dollars at september  was gbp 
four interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million which are used to hedge certain variable rate obligations under our credit facility 
the credit facility requires that we enter into hedge agreements to the extent necessary to provide that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due and term loan facilities is subject to a fixed rate 
the following table summarizes information about our derivative financial instruments and debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of september  for debt instruments  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents expected cash flows based on notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at september  the information is presented in us dollars in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swap on gbp libor average rate interest rate swaps on usd libor average rate other market risks our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material 
through fiscal  we had only minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the currency of the country of origin 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials  including urea and other chemicals and paper and plastic products 
our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply and to minimize costs 
we seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors 
we do not enter into forward contracts or other market instruments as a means of achieving our objectives or minimizing our risk exposures on these materials
