cash provided by operating activities for fiscal approximated  cash used in operating activities was attributable substantially to the funding of the net loss for fiscal cash provided by investing activities for fiscal approximated million 
the principal source of cash from investing activities during fiscal consisted of the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million less expenditures for property and equipment of approximately million 
cash used in financing activities for fiscal approximated  the principal uses of cash in financing activities during fiscal consisted of repayment of principal on long term debt of approximately million and the principal sources were proceeds from the issuance of convertible debentures of million and proceeds from the sale of a partnership interest of total liabilities increased since june  by approximately million  or to approximately million at june  the increase in liabilities from june  was attributable principally to the issuance of convertible debentures and deferred license fee revenue

the company believes that these resources alone provide an adequate reserve to fund its operations for approximately two years 
for the longer term  the company will need to rely on income generated by sales of its mri products and the profitability of hmca 
in order to conserve its capital resources  the company has issued common stock under its stock bonus and stock option plans to compensate employers and non employees for services rendered 
in fiscal  the compensatory element of stock issuances was as compared to for fiscal utilization of equity in lieu of cash compensation has improved the company s liquidity since it increases cash available for other expenditures

capital expenditures for fiscal and approximated million and million  respectively  and substantially consisted of office and production equipment 
fonar has not committed to making capital expenditures in the fiscal year other than its intention to continue research and development expenditures at current levels 
the company s business plan currently includes an aggressive program for manufacturing and selling its new line of open mri scanners 
in addition  the company is enhancing its revenue by participating into the physician and diagnostic management services business through its subsidiary  hmca 
the company s plan calls for a continuing emphasis on providing its customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from the company s installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  transactions between the company and its subsidiaries are eliminated in the consolidation 
the company believes that the above mentioned financial resources will provide the cash flows needed to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
in addition  the company is exploring other financing alternatives which may become available as the success of the previously described programs accelerates
