on november   these interest rate swap agreements were replaced with a one year agreement in the notional amount of euro million at a fixed rate of plus the applicable margin 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement at december   was not material 
a change in the prevailing interest rates of would result in a change in the total fair value of long term debt of approximately  fair values were determined from discounted cash flows
