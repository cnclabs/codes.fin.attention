see the description of forward looking statements found in forward looking statements 
effect of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on earnings during the past several years 
inflationary increases in the cost of labor  food and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s restaurant operating margins 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operations and increase menu prices to offset increases in its operating costs 
a majority of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in the minimum wage and in other costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year under the standard  entities will be required to carry all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company has historically used interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate on variable rate borrowings under the company s million revolving credit facility 
these interest rate swap agreements are classified as a hedge of a cash flow exposure under sfas no 
 and accordingly  the initial fair value and subsequent changes therein are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted cash flows affect earnings 
concurrent with the completion of the february common stock offering  the company amended its interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on future amounts under the company s credit facility 
the company paid million resulting in an after tax non recurring expense of  associated with amending the interest rate swap agreements to reduce the notional principal to amounts equal to the variable rate debt expected to be outstanding in the future under the company s credit facility 
this transaction is expected to result in an approximately decrease in diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of future changes in the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps structured as effective hedges will be reflected as a component of other comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   million was outstanding under the company s million revolving credit facility 
amounts outstanding under such credit facility bear interest at libor plus a margin of to depending on the company s leverage ratio  or the administrative agent s prime rate of interest plus a margin of to depending on the company s leverage ratio at the company s option 
accordingly  the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate movements 
to achieve the company s objective of managing its exposure to interest rate changes  the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps 
as of december   the company had interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  which effectively fixed the interest rate on million of the company s borrowings at  plus the applicable margin  through may   plus the applicable margin  through march  and  plus the applicable margin  through october the applicable margin on december  was

after amending the interest rate swap agreements  the company had effectively fixed the interest rate at  plus the applicable margin on million from july through june  million from july through march  and million from april through august the million  after tax non recurring expense associated with amending the interest rate swap agreements is expected to result in an approximately decrease in diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of the company is exposed to credit losses on this interest rate swap in the event of counterparty non performance  but does not anticipate any such losses 
while changes in libor and the administrative agent s prime rate of interest could affect the cost of borrowings under the credit facility in excess of amounts covered by the interest rate swap agreement in the future  the company does not consider its current exposure to changes in such rates to be material  and the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows would not be material 
investment portfolio the company invests portions of its excess cash  if any  in highly liquid investments 
at december   the company had no overnight repurchase agreements
