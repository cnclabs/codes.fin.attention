as a result of this process  we are in discussions with several of our partners in an effort to redefine the relationships in a manner that better serves the needs of each party 
these discussions have already resulted in revisions to some of our strategic relationships 
it is possible that  as a result of continuing discussions  additional relationships may be revised or terminated  which may result in additional restructuring charges 
in connection with our restructuring and integration efforts  we recorded restructuring and integration charges of million  of which million were non cash charges  in the year ended december  as we continue our consolidation and integration efforts  we are likely to incur additional costs relating to asset impairments and write offs  severance  employee retention arrangements related to exit activities  moving and relocations that will be expensed according to the applicable accounting guidelines

accordingly  our consolidated statements of operation and consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the results of porex

because we have only recently completed the acquisitions  it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is still emerging 
as a result  we believe that our historical financial information may not be an indicator of our future operating results 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses since we began operations and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
we plan to continue to invest heavily in the integration of our acquisitions  strategic relationships and infrastructure and applications development

our total revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to the revenue sources that were acquired in our and business combinations 
transaction services revenue comprised of total revenue in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the additional revenue from our acquisition of envoy in may and careinsite in september physician services revenue comprised of total revenue in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the additional revenue from our acquisition of medical manager in september and the full year impact of webmd practice subscription revenue from our november webmd  inc merger 
portal services revenue comprised of total revenue in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the full year impact of our november webmd  inc merger as well as the acquisition of onhealth in september other products and services revenue comprised of total revenue in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  this decrease reflects the phasing out of some of our non core product offerings 
we expect that revenue will increase in  primarily as a result of the companies acquired in  as our results reflect the operation of these companies for only the portion of the year from their respective acquisition dates 
this increase will be partially offset by the impact of the revised agreements with news corporation and dupont and the revised relationship contemplated by the non binding letter of intent with microsoft  each of which is described in business restructuring and integration on page  and the revision of other relationships and the phase out of non core products in connection with our restructuring and integration efforts 
revenue from related parties  which consists primarily of services provided to microsoft and news corporation in and of services provided to microsoft  unitedhealth group and smithkline labs in  increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increases in subscription and third party advertising revenue through our microsoft strategic alliance and from health related content licensed to news corporation

none of our customers individually accounted for more than of our revenue in cost of operations 
cost of operations increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase is attributable to expenses related to the companies acquired in and  which contributed million of the increase  and increased personnel and network operation costs  the cost to acquire exclusive arrangements to provide consumer healthcare related content to other web sites and other costs required to support increased service revenue

development and engineering 
development and engineering expense was million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the increase was the result of a significant increase in the number of engineers engaged in the development of our applications and services 
of the increase in development and engineering  million was a result of expenses incurred by the companies acquired in we expect that development and engineering costs will decrease in primarily as a result of the cost reductions related to our restructuring and integration efforts

as a result of this process  we are in discussions with several of our partners in an effort to redefine the relationships in a manner that better serves the needs of each party 
these discussions have already resulted in revisions to some of our strategic relationships  as discussed below

as we announced on september   our board of directors approved management s plan to dispose of porex  which we acquired in our acquisition of medical manager on september  porex designs  manufactures and distributes porous and solid plastic components and products used in life sciences  healthcare  industrial and consumer applications 
we expect to complete the disposition later this year 
the expected net proceeds and the cash flows of porex until sold were allocated to assets held for sale in the allocation of the medical manager purchase price and is included in the line item assets held for sale on our balance sheet 
any difference between the actual and expected amounts will result in an adjustment to goodwill unless there is a difference caused by a post acquisition event

the percentage of revenue shared varies from contract to contract and based on the type of revenue generated 
on march   microsoft and webmd entered into a non binding letter of intent with respect to revisions to our relationship 
see restructuring and integration microsoft on page we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including the capital requirements related to the roll out of our handheld solution in  for at least the next months 
however  we expect to incur losses before restructuring and integration charges  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  until the end of our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of the integration of our businesses  our existing and new application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments  potential future acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for the year ending december  sfas no 
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
derivatives that are not designated as part of a hedging relationship must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  the effective portion of the hedge s change in fair value is either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment through income  or held in equity until the hedged item is recognized in income 
the ineffective portion of a hedge s change in fair value is immediately recognized in income 
adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin no 
became effective july  and provides guidance for applying apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted fin no 
on july  and applied its guidance to the september  acquisitions of medical manager  careinsite and onhealth  resulting in deferred compensation of approximately million  which is reflected in stockholders equity 
in january  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached consensus on issue  accounting for advertising barter transactions  or eitf eitf establishes accounting and reporting standards for barter transactions which involve nonmonetary exchanges of advertising 
it requires that an entity recognize revenue and expenses from advertising barter transactions at the fair value of the advertising surrendered only when an entity has a historical practice of receiving cash for similar transactions 
we believe that our current revenue recognition principles comply with eitf in march  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached consensus on issue  accounting for website development costs  or eitf eitf establishes how an entity should account for costs incurred to develop a web site 
it requires that an entity capitalize costs during the web application and infrastructure and graphics development stages of development 
the consensus is effective for all costs incurred beginning after june   although earlier adoption is encouraged 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results of operations our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies we have in the past acquired  and may in the future acquire  businesses  technologies  services  product lines or content databases 
for example  we completed our mergers with webmd  inc  mede america and medcast in november  our mergers with kinetra in january and envoy in may and our mergers with medical manager  careinsite and onhealth in september in september  our board of directors approved a restructuring and integration plan  with the objective of eliminating duplication and redundancies as a result of the acquisitions made by us since november and of consolidating our operational infrastructure 
we are in the process of integrating and consolidating the operations  products and services  technologies and personnel of these companies 
in connection with our restructuring and integration efforts  we recorded restructuring and integration charges of million  of which million were non cash charges  in the year ended december  as we continue our consolidation and integration efforts  we are likely to incur additional costs relating to asset impairments and write offs  severance  stay bonuses  moving and relocations that will be expensed according to the applicable accounting guidelines 
we expect our restructuring and integration efforts will continue during for additional information regarding our restructuring and integration efforts  see business restructuring and integration beginning on page and note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
the successful integration of the acquired businesses into our operations is critical to our future performance 
the amount and timing of the benefits of our restructuring and integration efforts and the success of the contemplated integration and rationalization of our businesses are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those relating to ability to cross sell products and services to payers and providers with which we have established relationships and those with which the acquired companies have established relationships the loss of key personnel diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns potential conflicts in payer  provider  strategic partner  sponsor or advertising relationships coordination of organizations that are geographically diverse and have different business cultures compliance with regulatory requirements 
we cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely manner  or at all 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve operating synergies  revenue enhancements or cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
integrating any additional acquired organizations and technologies in the future could also be expensive and time consuming and may strain our resources and would be subject to the same challenges  risks and uncertainties as our current integration efforts  as described above 
we are dependent on strategic relationships to generate some of our revenue our ability to generate revenue will suffer if we cannot establish and maintain successful strategic relationships 
we have entered into strategic relationships with leading online and media distribution and healthcare partners 
successful strategic relationships are an important means to increase the number of transactions processed over our network  generate traffic on our web site and capitalize on additional distribution and revenue opportunities 
as previously announced  we have been renegotiating some of the strategic relationships we currently have in place and some of these relationships have been modified or terminated 
it is possible that additional relationships may be modified or terminated  as discussed in business restructuring and integration on page and note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
we expect that we will face intensified competition for strategic relationships 
disputes with strategic partners and customers may be resolved unfavorably to us and may harm our relationships 
some of our strategic partners have initiated or threatened to initiate litigation or other dispute resolution mechanisms regarding alleged breaches of our agreements and other claims 
similarly  in some cases  we have initiated or threatened to initiate litigation or other dispute resolution mechanisms when we believed our partner or customer is in breach of its obligations  if we have been unable to resolve the dispute through negotiations 
we cannot provide assurance that these disputes will be resolved in our favor or  even if resolved in our favor  that we will be able to preserve the benefits we expected to achieve from our relationships with those partners  which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we share revenue with our strategic partners and will incur significant expense in connection with our strategic relationships  and this expense may exceed the net revenue these relationships generate 
we have agreed to share some of our transaction processing  advertising  carriage fee and e commerce revenue with some of our strategic partners and  in some cases  to make guaranteed payments to our strategic partners 
we may enter into additional arrangements with current or future strategic partners that require us to share revenue  make guaranteed payments or incur other significant expenses 
we cannot give assurances that we will generate sufficient revenue from our arrangements with strategic partners to offset all required payments and expenses 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have invested in some of our strategic partners  many of which are in early stages of development 
we have made equity investments in some of our strategic partners 
in many instances  these investments are in the form of illiquid securities of private companies engaged in e health and were made in conjunction with the parties entering into a strategic agreement 
typically  these strategic partners entered into agreements that obligate them to purchase advertising or other services from us 
these companies are typically in an early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses and may not generate sufficient revenue to pay the advertising and e commerce fees due us 
in addition  due to recent market volatility  some of these companies have altered their plans to go public  and others that have gone public have experienced or may experience significant decreases in the trading prices of their common stock  adversely affecting the value of our investments 
some of these companies may go out of business before we are able to sell our investments 
we have granted exclusive rights to strategic partners 
we have agreed that some of our strategic partners will be our exclusive providers of some of our applications and content 
for example  we have entered into strategic agreements with e commerce companies to be our exclusive partners supplying online pharmacy services and medical supplies and to be our exclusive providers of various categories of content and services 
these agreements may limit our access to other applications and content we might otherwise be able to make available to subscribers and consumers or to payer and provider customers 
our inability to offer other applications and content could cause our business to suffer 
in addition  we have granted exclusive rights to strategic partners which restrict our ability to pursue some business opportunities 
for example  in connection with our acquisition of envoy from quintiles  we granted to quintiles the exclusive license to use some of the de identified data available to us by virtue of our transaction services and some exclusive rights in the pharmaceutical market 
relationships with customers and strategic partners may conflict we have developed and rely upon important relationships with payers  providers  practice management system vendors and strategic partners  some of which may involve conflicting contractual rights  including conflicts which may result from our recent acquisitions 
as a result of conflicts or perceived conflicts resulting from our acquisitions or our business plans and strategic initiatives  we may lose relationships with  or be subject to litigation by  some other customers and strategic partners  who may then establish relationships with our competitors 
for example  infocure  a practice management system vendor whose products compete with the medical manager products  has initiated litigation against us  alleging breach of contract  tortious interference with business relations and other claims 
we are currently in the process of negotiating new arrangements with medic  another practice management system vendor  that would replace prior arrangements and better serve the needs of each party 
however  we cannot provide assurance that these negotiations will be successful 
if these negotiations are not successful  there could be litigation or other proceedings that arise out of the relationship or its termination 
some of our other customers and strategic partners have initiated or threatened to initiate litigation or other dispute resolution mechanisms to enforce rights they purport to have as a result of conflicts with our other relationships or with our business plans or strategic initiatives  or their belief that these conflicts exist 
we cannot provide assurance that these disputes will be resolved in our favor or  even if resolved in our favor  that we will be able to preserve the benefits we expected to receive from our relationships with those partners 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or establish relationships with key participants in the healthcare and internet industries if any of the companies we acquired had already established relationships with competitors of these key participants 
if contractual or relationship conflicts or other issues cannot be resolved  we could lose the benefits of some of our relationships with payers  providers or strategic partners 
losses of any significant relationships could harm our business or results of operations 
our ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not expand our suite of applications and service offerings healthcare information exchange and transaction processing is a relatively new and evolving market 
the pace of change in our markets is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
we may be unsuccessful in responding to technological developments and changing customer needs 
in addition  our applications and services offerings may become obsolete due to the adoption of new technologies or standards 
we currently offer a limited number of applications on our internet based platform and some of our service offerings  including our handheld solution  are not fully developed or launched 
we must introduce new applications and services and improve the functionality of our existing services in a timely manner in order to attract and retain customers 
we rely on a combination of internal development  strategic relationships  licensing and acquisitions to develop these applications and services 
each of our applications  regardless of how it was developed  must be integrated and customized to operate with the existing legacy computer systems of payer and provider customers and our platform 
we are currently in the process of integrating acquired applications and products and services 
developing  integrating and customizing these applications and services will be time consuming  and these applications and services may never achieve market acceptance  which could also cause our business to suffer 
new or newly integrated products and services will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of physician penetration and market acceptance there can be no assurance that physicians will accept new or newly integrated products and services from us  including the products and services we are developing to integrate our transaction services and portal services into their office workflow  such as our handheld solution 
even physicians who are already our customers may not purchase new or newly integrated products or services  especially when they are initially offered 
physicians using our existing products and services may refuse to adopt new or newly integrated products and services when they have made extensive investments in hardware  software and training relating to those existing products and services 
similarly  other healthcare participants may not accept new or newly integrated products and services from us developed for their use 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any such products and services will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or newly integrated products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
achieving market acceptance for new or newly integrated products and services is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry 
in addition  deployment of new or newly integrated products may require the use of additional resources for training our existing sales force and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel 
there can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from new or newly integrated products and services will justify amounts spent for their development  marketing and roll out 
our business model for providing internet based services is unproven  and we may not achieve profits from this business our business model for providing internet based services is evolving  and our revenue and profit potential from these services is unproven 
we intend to offer provider and payer customers our internet based transaction services  to the extent that is appropriate to their needs integrate these transaction services with our medical manager practice management systems and similar systems provided by others build usage of our portal services by consumers  physicians and physician officer managers generate e commerce revenue from the sale of healthcare products or services of our strategic partners and other suppliers over the internet 
however  the provision of services over the internet to the healthcare industry is a developing business that is inherently riskier than businesses in industries where companies have established operating histories and there can be no assurance that our initiatives in this area will be profitable 
we may not be able to generate significant advertising revenue from our portal services we derive a portion of our revenue from advertising activities 
advertising revenue is generally derived from short term advertising contracts in which we typically guarantee a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
advertising revenue may also include barter transactions  which are exchanges by us of advertising space on our web site for goods and services from strategic partners and which might not generate any cash receipts 
the internet advertising market is new and rapidly evolving  and no standards have been widely accepted to measure its effectiveness as compared to traditional media advertising 
if no standards develop  existing advertisers may not continue their current level of internet advertising  and advertisers that have traditionally relied on other advertising media may be reluctant to advertise on the internet 
moreover  filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a web user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
demand for internet advertising in general has  during the first quarter of  been weaker than in recent quarters and there can be no assurance that such demand will return to the levels seen previously 
our business would be adversely affected if the market for internet advertising fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected 
various pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet 
it is difficult to predict which  if any  will emerge as the industry standard  thereby making it difficult to project our future advertising rates and revenue 
the level of traffic on our web site is likely to be a factor in determining advertising rates 
lengthy sales and implementation cycles for our applications could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue a key element of our strategy is to market our solutions directly to large healthcare organizations 
we will be unable to control many of the factors that will influence the buying decisions of these organizations 
we expect that the sales and implementation processes will be lengthy and will involve a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by our customers 
the sale and implementation of our solutions are subject to delays due to our payer and provider customers internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and deploying new technologies within their networks 
failure to continue to expand and adapt our platform to accommodate increased usage could make it difficult to successfully implement our internet based services to successfully implement our internet based services  we must continue to expand and adapt our platform and transaction networks to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes and changing customer requirements 
our infrastructure may not accommodate increased use while maintaining acceptable overall performance 
to date  we have processed a limited number and variety of internet based transactions 
in addition  our internet based products and services have only been used by a limited number of physicians and healthcare consumers 
an unexpectedly large increase in the volume of traffic on our web site or transactions processed over our networks may require us to expand and further upgrade our platform 
this expansion could be expensive and could divert our attention from other activities 
performance problems with our systems could damage our business our payer and provider customer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we or our customers experience system delays  failures or loss of data 
we currently process our payer and provider transactions and data at our facilities and rely on a data center operated by a third party to perform edi transaction processing  other than real time edi transaction processing 
this data center is located in tampa  florida and is operated by verizon data services  with whom we have contracted for these processing services 
we rely primarily on this facility to process batch claims and other batch medical edi transaction sets 
our contract with verizon requires verizon to maintain processing capability and a hot site disaster recovery system 
we have a contingency plan for emergencies with our systems  however  we have limited backup facilities to process information if these facilities are not functioning 
the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities or at the verizon facility could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
if our systems or the internet experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure  our business could suffer a material security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability 
we retain confidential information  including patient health information  in our processing centers 
it is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be perceived by the marketplace as secure 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
in addition  any well publicized compromise of internet security  whether or not related to our own operations  could damage our internet based businesses 
performance problems with the systems of our service and content providers could disrupt our web site we depend on service and content providers to provide information and data feeds on a timely basis 
our web site could experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information 
our internet based services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure and the adoption of broadband connections by physician offices our ability to deliver our internet based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complimentary products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  increased frequency of use or more complex requirements  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it 
in addition  the performance of the internet may be harmed by increased users or more complex requirements 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet based services 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to increased governmental regulation 
the infrastructure and complimentary products or services necessary to make the internet a viable commercial marketplace for the long term may not be developed successfully or in a timely manner 
our financial condition could be materially harmed if the internet is not available to us for the delivery of our services and products 
in addition  our customers who utilize our web based services depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web site 
all of these providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties in the future due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users of and advertisers and sponsors on our web site and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services 
some of our services require a continuous broadband connection between the physician s office and our data center and or the internet 
the availability of broadband connectivity varies widely from location to location and even within a single geographic area  due to factors such as the distance of a site from the central switching office 
the future availability of broadband connections is unpredictable and is not within our control 
while we expect that many physician office locations will remain without ready access to broadband connectivity for some period of time  we cannot predict how long that will be 
accordingly  the lack of these broadband connections will continue to place limitations on the number of sites that are able to utilize our internet based services and the revenue we can expect to generate from those services 
our internet platform infrastructure and scalability are not proven  and we may not be able to adequately accommodate increased functionality or usage to date  we have processed a limited number and variety of internet transactions over our platforms 
similarly  a limited number of healthcare participants use these internet platforms 
our systems may not accommodate increased use while maintaining acceptable overall performance 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network infrastructure to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes and changing payer and provider customer requirements 
our business could be adversely affected if we cannot attract and retain key personnel our future operating results substantially depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
we need to attract  integrate  motivate and retain highly skilled technical people 
in particular  we need to attract and retain experienced computer  engineering  marketing  management and other professionals capable of developing  selling and installing complex healthcare information systems 
we face intense competition for these people 
we face significant competition for our products and services the market for our services is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers than we do 
many of our competitors have also announced or introduced internet strategies that will compete with our applications and services 
we may be unable to compete successfully against these organizations 
for more information about our competitors  see business competition beginning on page our business may be subject to litigation our business and operations may subject us to claims  litigation and other proceedings brought by private parties and governmental authorities 
for information regarding certain proceedings to which we are currently a party  see legal proceedings beginning on page healthcare regulation could adversely affect our business the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  regulatory and other influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider programs to reform or revise the us healthcare system at both the federal and state levels 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our applications and services 
we are unable to predict future proposals with any certainty or to predict the effect they would have on our business 
existing laws and regulations also could create liability  cause us to incur additional cost and restrict our operations 
many healthcare laws are complex  applied broadly and subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities 
in addition  many existing healthcare laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the methods of healthcare e commence and other products and services that we provide 
however  these laws and regulations may nonetheless be applied to our products and services 
our failure  or the failure of our business partners  to accurately anticipate the application of these healthcare laws  or other failure to comply  could create liability for us  result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business 
for more information regarding healthcare regulation to which we are or may be subject  see business government regulation beginning on page we face potential liability related to the privacy and security of the patient health information we receive and transmit we receive  store and transmit individually identifiable patient information  which is or may be subject to various complex state and federal privacy laws  when we provide practice management services to physicians and when we process healthcare transactions 
we have attempted to design our systems and structure our business relationships to comply with these laws 
however  this area of the law is complex and these state and federal privacy laws are subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities 
in addition  determining whether we are in compliance with these laws can require complex factual analyses 
for example  see legal proceedings quintiles v 
webmd beginning on page moreover  this area of the law is constantly evolving and we may be held to new standards that our systems may not immediately meet or we may be subject to third party claims for privacy breaches that are inadvertent or the result of these evolving standards 
new standards could require expensive new technologies and could affect our business operations and relationships 
claims of privacy breaches  even if we are not found liable  could be expensive and time consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
for more information regarding regulation of patient information to which we may be subject  see business government regulation beginning on page regulation of the internet could adversely affect our business the internet and its associated technologies are subject to government regulation 
our failure  or the failure of our business partners  to accurately anticipate the application of applicable laws and regulations  or any other failure to comply  could create liability for us  result in adverse publicity  or negatively affect our business 
in addition  new laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering user privacy  patient confidentiality  consumer protection and other issues  including pricing content copyrights and patents distribution characteristics and quality of products and services 
we cannot predict whether laws or regulations will change or how such changes will affect our business 
government regulation of the internet could limit the effectiveness of the internet for the methods of healthcare e commerce that we are providing or developing or even prohibit the sale of particular products and services 
for more information regarding government regulation of the internet to which we are or may be subject  see business government regulation beginning on page we face potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information we collect on our web sites internet user privacy has become a controversial issue both in the us and abroad 
we have privacy policies posted on our consumer portal and our professional portal that we believe comply with applicable laws requiring notice to users about our information collection  use and disclosure practices 
however  whether and how existing privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the internet still is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
any legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information could affect the way we operate our web sites and could harm our business 
further  we can give no assurance that the statements on our portals  or our practices  will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity in this area 
for more information regarding regulation of the collection  use and disclosure of personal information to which we may be subject  see business government regulation beginning on page third parties may challenge the enforceability of our online agreements the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving 
we could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers and physicians that provide the terms and conditions for use of our portal services and physician services are unenforceable 
a finding by a court that these agreements are invalid could harm our business and require costly changes to our portals 
third parties may bring claims as a result of the activities of our strategic partners we could be subject to claims by third parties  and to liability  as a result of the activities  products or services of our strategic partners 
we state on our portals that we do not control or endorse the products or services of our strategic partners 
however  there can be no assurance that the statements made in our portal will be found to be sufficient to ensure that we are not held responsible for such activities  products or services 
furthermore  even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending these claims could be expensive  time consuming and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
third parties may bring claims against us as a result of content provided on our web site  which may be expensive and time consuming to defend we could be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our web site by us or third parties  including content providers  medical advisors or users 
we could also be subject to liability for content that may be accessible through our web site or third party web sites linked from our web site or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms  bulletin boards or on web sites created by professionals using our web site application 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from operating the business 
our intellectual property may be subject to infringement claims or may be infringed upon our intellectual property is important to our business 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of our applications overlaps with competitive offerings 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert management s attention from our operations 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop noninfringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  we may not be able to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights 
if we do not detect any unauthorized use  we may be unable to enforce our rights 
the proposed disposition of our plastics and filtration technologies business may not be completed in the manner expected or at all if our proposed disposition of porex fails to be completed  is not completed in a timely manner or does not provide us with the proceeds anticipated  we may not be able to execute strategies that are important to our business 
we cannot guarantee that the disposition of porex will be successfully completed in the manner planned  or at all 
failure to successfully complete this proposed disposition as anticipated or to complete it in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
until we dispose of our plastics and filtration technologies business  we will be subject to risks associated with that business until the proposed disposition of our plastic and filtration technologies business is completed  we will continue to operate that business and to be subject to additional risks associated with that business  which include we face significant competition for the products and services of our plastic and filtration technologies business 
competition in our plastics and filtration technology business is characterized by the introduction of competitive products at lower prices 
we believe that porex s principal competitive strengths are its manufacturing processes  quality control  relationships with its customers and distribution of its proprietary healthcare products 
in the porous plastics area  porex s competitors include other producers of porous plastic materials as well as companies that manufacture and sell products made from materials other than porous plastics which can be used for the same purposes as porex s products 
in this area  porex has several direct competitors in the us  europe and asia 
porex s porous plastic pen nibs compete with felt and fiber tips manufactured by a variety of suppliers worldwide 
other porex industrial products made of porous plastic compete  depending on the industrial application  with porous metals  metal screens  fiberglass tubes  pleated paper  resin impregnated felt  ceramics and other substances and devices 
the market for porex s injection molded solid plastic components and products  including its medical products  is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
porex s pipette tips and racks also compete with similar products manufactured by domestic and foreign manufacturers 
porex s injection molding and mold making services compete with services offered by several foreign and domestic companies 
the medpor r biomaterial products compete for surgical use against autogenous and allograph materials and alloplastic biomaterials 
porex s surgical drains and markers compete against a variety of products from several manufacturers 
healthcare regulation could adversely affect our plastics and filtration technologies business 
porex manufactures and distributes medical surgical devices  such as plastic and reconstructive surgical implants and tissue expanders  which are subject to government regulations  under the fda act and additional regulations promulgated by the fda 
future healthcare products may also be subject to these regulations and approval processes 
compliance with these regulations and the process of obtaining approvals can be costly  complicated and time consuming  and we cannot assure you that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if ever 
the nature of porex s products exposes it to product liability claims and may make it difficult to get adequate insurance coverage 
the products sold by porex expose it to potential risk for product liability claims  particularly with respect to porex s life sciences  clinical  surgical and medical products 
we believe that porex carries adequate insurance coverage against product liability claims and other risks 
we cannot assure you  however  that claims in excess of porex s insurance coverage will not arise 
in addition  porex s insurance policies must be renewed annually 
although porex has been able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost in the past and believes that it is adequately indemnified for products manufactured by others and distributed by it  we cannot assure you that in the future porex will be able to obtain this insurance at an acceptable cost or be adequately protected by this indemnification 
since march  porex has been named as one of many co defendants in a number of actions brought by recipients of silicone gel mammary implants 
for more information regarding these actions  see legal proceedings porex mammary implant litigation on page our stock price has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile the market prices of internet and healthcare information technology stocks in general  and of our common stock in particular  have experienced large fluctuations  sometimes quite rapidly 
changes in the market price of our common stock may result from numerous factors  including the factors discussed in market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters on page in addition  any change in investors perceptions of the performance and prospects of internet or healthcare information technology stocks may result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock  whether or not related to or indicative of our performance or prospects 
sales of large amounts of our shares and the lapse of transfer restrictions could adversely affect prevailing stock prices sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could materially and adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of equity or equity related securities in the future 
substantial amounts of our outstanding common stock will become freely transferable from time to time until the second quarter of  as contractual restrictions on transfer lapse 
additional amounts of our common stock will also become available for sale  from time to time  as holding periods under applicable securities regulations are met 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
this is accomplished by adherence to our investment policy  which establishes the list of eligible securities and credit requirements for each investment 
changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the principle amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities in commercial paper  non government debt securities  money market funds and highly liquid us treasury notes and federal agency notes 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
as a result  we have changed our presentation of market risk from the tabular disclosure in prior years 
the weighted average interest rate of the portfolio was at december  principal amounts expected to mature are million  million  million  million and million for    and  respectively 
we had investments totaling million in us treasury notes and federal agency notes that were callable subjecting us to reinvestment risk on these securities 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity currently the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we conduct only limited transactions in foreign currencies  and we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant in the foreseeable future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date
