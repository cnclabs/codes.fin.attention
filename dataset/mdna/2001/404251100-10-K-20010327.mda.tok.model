the us office furniture market consists of two primary segments the project segment and the transactional segment 
the project segment has traditionally been characterized by sales of large quantities of office furniture to large corporations  such as for new office facilities  relocations  or department or office redesigns  which are frequently customized to meet specific client and designer preferences 
project furniture is generally purchased through office furniture dealers who typically prepare a custom designed office layout emphasizing image and design 
the process is often lengthy and generally has several manufacturers competing for the same projects 
overhead and support associated with the sales and customization efforts in this segment are major reasons why the prices for project office furniture have traditionally been relatively high 
the transactional segment of the market  in which the company is a leader  primarily represents smaller orders of office furniture purchased by businesses and home office users on the basis of price  quality  selection and quick delivery 
office products dealers  wholesalers and retailers  such as office products superstores  are the primary distribution channels in this market segment

the gunlocke company manufactures office furniture in new york 
bpi inc manufactures office furniture in california  north carolina  and washington 
hearth technologies inc manufactures hearth products in iowa  maryland  minnesota  washington  and calgary  canada 
the company purchases raw materials and components from a variety of vendors  and generally most items are available from multiple sources 
major raw materials and components include coil steel  bar stock  castings  lumber  veneer  particle board  fabric  paint  lacquer  hardware  rubber products  plastic products  and shipping cartons 
since its inception  the company has focused on making its manufacturing facilities and processes more flexible while at the same time reducing costs and improving product quality 
in  the company adopted the principles of rci  which focus on developing flexible and efficient design  manufacturing and administrative processes that remove excess cost 
to achieve flexibility and attain efficiency goals  the company has adopted a variety of production techniques including cell manufacturing  focused factories  just in time inventory management and value engineering 
the application of the rci process has increased productivity by reducing set up and processing times  square footage  inventory levels  product costs and delivery times  while improving quality and enhancing member safety 
the company s rci process involves production and administrative employees  management  customers and suppliers 
the company has facilitators  coaches and consultants dedicated to the rci process and strives to involve all members in the rci process 
in addition  the company has organized a group that designs  fabricates  tests and installs proprietary manufacturing equipment 
manufacturing also plays a key role in the company s concurrent product development process that primarily seeks to design new products for ease of manufacturability 
product development the company s product development efforts are primarily focused on reducing the cost to manufacture existing products and designing new products that provide additional features and quality 
the company accomplishes this through improving existing products  extending product lines  applying ergonomic research  improving manufacturing processes  applying alternative materials and providing engineering support and training to its operating units 
the company conducts its product development efforts at both the corporate and operating unit level 
at the corporate level  the staff at the company s stanley m 
howe technical center  working in conjunction with operating staff  seeks breakthrough developments in product design  manufacturability and materials usage 
at the operating unit level  development efforts are focused on achieving incremental improvements in product features and manufacturing processes 
the company invested approximately million  million  and million in product development during fiscal   and  respectively  and has budgeted in excess of million for product development in fiscal intellectual property as of december   the company owned us and foreign patents and had applications pending for us and foreign patents 
in addition  the company holds registrations for us and foreign trademarks and has applications pending for us and foreign trademarks 
the company s principal office furniture products do not require frequent technical changes 
the majority of the company s patents are design patents which expire at various times depending on the patent s date of issuance 
the company believes that neither any individual patent nor the company s patents in the aggregate are material to the company s business as a whole 
when hearth technologies inc acquired heat n glo in october  it also acquired its patent for the design of a zero clearance direct vent gas fireplace the direct vent patent 
the company currently offers numerous product designs that would not be possible without the direct vent technology 
although the company believes that the protection afforded by the direct vent patent is not vital to sustaining hearth technologies gross profit margins on its direct vent gas fireplaces  the technology that underlies the patent is a significant distinguishing feature for the company s products 
the company applies for patent protection when it believes the expense of doing so is justified  and believes that the duration of its registered patents is adequate to protect these rights 
the company also pays royalties in certain instances for the use of patents on products and processes owned by others 
the company actively protects its trademarks that it believes have significant goodwill value 
sales and distribution customers over the last ten years  the office products and office furniture industries have experienced substantial consolidation as larger dealers have acquired smaller local and regional dealers 
consolidation permits large dealers to benefit from economies of scale  increased purchasing power  and the elimination of redundant management and overhead expenses 
larger dealers have also been able to take advantage of more sophisticated management techniques designed to enhance customer service  lower costs and increase operating efficiency 
at the same time  office products superstores have emerged and replaced local retail office supply stores 
the company believes that these trends may continue to result in fewer  larger dealers and retailers as customers for the company s products 
in  the company s ten largest customers represented approximately of its consolidated net sales 
the substantial purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the company can successfully offer its products 
as a result of this consolidation  changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on the company s financial results than such events would have had prior to such consolidation 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its customer relationships as consolidation of its customers occur 
as a result of these trends  the company today sells its products through five principal distribution channels 
the first channel  independent  local office furniture and office products dealers  specialize in the sale of a broad range of office furniture and office furniture systems  mostly to small and medium sized businesses  branch offices of large corporations  and home office owners 
the second distribution channel comprises nationwide chains of office products dealers  or mega dealers  including boise cascade corporation  us office products company  corporate express inc  a buhrmann company  office depot business services group  and staples commercial advantage 
many of the independent dealers and mega dealer locations assist their customers with the evaluation of office space requirements  systems layout and product selection  and design and office solution services provided by professional designers 
the third distribution channel  wholesalers  serve as distributors of the company s products to independent dealers  mega dealers and superstores 
the company sells to the nation s largest wholesalers  united stationers and sp richards  as well as to regional wholesalers 
wholesalers maintain stocks of standard product lines for resale to the various retailers 
they also special order products from the company in customer selected models and colors 
the company s wholesalers maintain warehouse locations throughout the united states  which enable the company to make its products available for rapid delivery to retailers anywhere in the country 
one customer  united stationers  accounted for approximately   and of the company s consolidated net sales in   and  respectively 
the fourth distribution channel is retail stores  which include office products superstores such as office depot  office max  and staples and warehouse clubs like costco 
the fifth distribution channel consists of government focused dealers that sell the company s products to federal  state and local government offices 
as of december   the company s office furniture sales force consisted of regional sales managers supervising salespersons  plus approximately firms of independent manufacturers representatives who collectively provided national sales coverage 
sales managers and salespersons are compensated by a combination of salary and incentive bonus 
office products dealers  national wholesalers and retailers market their products over the world wide web and through catalogs published periodically and distributed to existing and potential customers 
the company s marketing objective is to gain share in its distributors media 
the company believes that the inclusion of the company s product lines in customer catalogs offers strong potential for increased sales of the listed product items due to the exposure provided by these publications 
the company also makes export sales through hon international inc to approximately office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets 
distributors are principally located in latin america and the caribbean 
the company has an international field sales organization consisting of a vice president of sales and marketing and four regional managers 
sales outside of the united states and canada represented approximately of net sales in fiscal limited quantities of select finished goods inventories are maintained at the company s principal manufacturing plants and at its various distribution centers 
hearth technologies inc sells its fireplace and stove products through approximately  dealers and distributors 
the company has a field sales organization of regional sales managers supervising salespersons and firms of independent manufacturers representatives 
as of december   the company has an order backlog of approximately million which will be filled in the ordinary course of business within the current fiscal year 
this compares with million as of january   and million as of january  backlog  in terms of percentage of net sales  was   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company s products are manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order 
the dollar amount of the company s order backlog is therefore not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the company s expected sales in any particular fiscal period 
for a discussion of the seasonal nature of the company s sales  see operating segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a significant number of competitors offering similar products 
the company competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products 
in executing this strategy  the company has two significant classes of competitors 
first  the company competes with numerous small and medium sized office furniture manufacturers that focus on more limited product lines and or end user segments and include global furniture inc  national office furniture  a division of kimball office furniture co  chromcraft  paoli  and high point furniture industries  inc second  the company competes with a small number of large office furniture manufacturers which control a substantial portion of the market share in the project oriented office furniture market  such as steelcase inc  haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  and knoll  inc 
some of these large competitors have substantially greater assets  resources and capabilities in the traditional project market than the company 
products and brands offered by these project oriented office furniture market participants have strong acceptance in the market place and have developed  and may continue to develop  value priced product designs to compete with the company 
the company also faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in its markets in the future 
hearth products  consisting of prefabricated metal fireplaces and related products  are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors 
a limited number of manufacturers  however  are predominant in this industry 
the company competes primarily against the other large manufacturers which include cfm majestic inc a canadian company  lennox industries inc 
superior and marco brands  martin industries inc  and fireplace manufacturers inc 
fmi 
both office furniture and hearth products compete on the basis of price  product performance  product quality  complete and on time delivery to the customer  and customer service and support 
the company believes that it competes principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality and performance  superior customer service  and short lead times 
this is made possible  in part  by the company s significant on going investment in product development  highly efficient and low cost manufacturing operations  and an extensive distribution network 
the company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the united states  and believes that it is the largest manufacturer of value priced furniture 
the company is also the largest manufacturer and marketer of fireplaces in the united states 
for further discussion of the company s competitive situation  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation certain business costs may  from time to time  increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation 
the company s objective is to offset the effect of inflation on its costs primarily through productivity increases in combination with certain adjustments to the selling price of its products as competitive market and general economic conditions permit 
investments are routinely made in modern plants  equipment  support systems  and for rapid continuous improvement programs 
these investments collectively focus on increasing productivity which helps to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs 
ongoing cost control disciplines are also routinely employed 
in addition  the last in  first out lifo valuation method is used for most of the company s inventories  which ensures the changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income  and more importantly  these costs are recognized in pricing decisions 
environmental the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges of air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials  and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all of the various regulations applicable to its business  there can be no assurance that requirements will not change in the future or that the company will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations 
the company has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental  health  and safety requirements 
the company s environmental professionals work with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility  the company s environmental legal counsel  and consultants on the management of environmental  health and safety issues 
the company s ultimate goal is to reduce and  when practical  eliminate the creation of hazardous waste in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with federal  state  and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position of the company to date 
the company does not anticipate that financially material capital expenditures will be required during fiscal year for environmental control facilities 
it is management s judgment that compliance with current regulations should not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  the uncertainty of new environmental legislation and technology in this area makes it impossible to know with confidence 
for additional information about the company s environmental matters  refer to item legal proceedings and the contingencies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
business development the development of the company s business during the fiscal years ended december   january   and january   is discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

although the plants are of varying ages  the company believes they are well maintained  are equipped with modern and efficient equipment  and are in good operating condition and suitable for the purposes for which they are being used

refer to the property  plant  and equipment note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for related cost  accumulated depreciation  and net book value data 
item legal proceedings the company is involved in certain continuing activities in pennsylvania to clean up environmental contamination at one site formerly owned by a subsidiary of the company 
the pennsylvania environmental authorities are supervising this activity 
the costs associated with this site are primarily related to the operation of a groundwater remediation system 
these costs have not had a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
due to such factors as the wide discretion of regulatory authorities regarding clean up levels and uncertain allocation of liability at multiple party sites  estimates made prior to the approval of a formal plan of action represent management s best judgment as to estimates of reasonably foreseeable expenses based upon average remediation costs at comparable sites 
the company  therefore  has accrued liabilities reflecting management s current  best estimate of the eventual future cost of the company s anticipated share of remediation costs
