there can be no assurance the company will achieve significant commercial revenues or profitability 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the company s distribution agreement with baxter healthcare corporation entered into in  which resulted in sales of units of the patient state analyzer  which began during the third quarter of sales of the company s hydrodot neuromonitoring products were relatively unchanged compared with the previous year
