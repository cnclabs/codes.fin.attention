all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that management anticipates will occur in the future  including statements related to future revenue  profits  expenses  income and earnings per share or statements expressing general optimism about future results  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act 
in addition  words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the exchange act 
any number of factors could affect future operations and results 
the company has identified the following important factors  which could cause the company s actual operational or financial results to differ materially from any projections  estimates  forecasts or other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
under no circumstances should the factors listed below be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by the company 
datatrak undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
limited operating history  lack of profitable operations the company began providing edc services in and has a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate its performance 
datatrak has recognized operating losses in each year since we cannot assure you that the company will be profitable during future periods 
continuing development of datatrak edc  ability to absorb corporate overhead although the datatrak edc software has been used in clinical trials  its continued development is necessary 
to date the company has had minimal edc revenue from which to support the costs of this continued development 
there can be no guarantee of datatrak s potential future revenue  or its ability to absorb its corporate overhead and other fixed operating costs that will be necessary for the success of the datatrak process 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company is subject to significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including the company s success in obtaining new contracts  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which the company participates  the timing of clinical trial sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or cancel or delay ongoing trials and other factors 
as a result of datatrak s limited operating history  the company does not have historical financial data for a significant number of periods on which to base planned operating expenses 
therefore  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenue and to a certain extent are fixed 
we cannot assure you as to the company s revenue in any given period  and it may be unable to adjust expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result of the company s relatively small revenue base  any significant shortfall in revenue recognized during a particular period could have an immediate adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that the company will be able to accurately anticipate quarterly results 
volatility in the company s quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of the common shares 

table of contents risks associated with unproven business strategies and early stage of the company s development the company s efforts to establish a standardized edc process for collection and management of clinical research data represent a significant departure from the traditional clinical research practices of clinical trial sponsors 
the long term viability of the company s business remains unproven 
we cannot assure you that the company s strategy will continue to gain acceptance among sponsors  research sites or investigators 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  and we cannot assure you that the company will be successful in these efforts 
potential delay or loss of contracts although the company s contracts provide that it is entitled to receive revenue earned through the date of termination  customers generally are free to delay or terminate a clinical trial or the company s contract related thereto at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several months to several years 
clinical trial sponsors may delay or terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or drug 
a clinical trial sponsor s decision to delay or terminate a trial in which the company participates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on major customers the company s primary customers are companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company s business is substantially dependent on the research and development expenditures of companies in this industry 
during and  quintiles accounted for and  respectively of datatrak s edc revenue 
aventis pharmaceuticals accounted for and of datatrak s edc revenue during and  respectively 
bayer accounted for all of datatrak s edc revenue  totaling  the extent to which the company relies on revenue from one customer varies from period to period  depending upon  among other things  its ability to generate new business  the timing and size of clinical trials and other factors 
in light of the company s small revenue base  it is more dependent on major customers than many of the larger participants in the edc industry 
the company s operations could be materially and adversely affected by  among other things  any economic downturn or consolidations in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  any decrease in their research and development expenditures or a change in the regulatory environment in which these companies operate 
management of growth  need for improved systems the company believes that the expansion of its business will continue to place a strain on its operational  human and financial resources 
in order to manage such expansion  the company must continue to improve its operating  administrative and information systems and accurately predict its future personnel and resource needs 
in addition  expansion of foreign operations also may involve the additional risks of assimilating differences in foreign business practices  hiring and retaining qualified personnel and overcoming language barriers 
failure by the company to meet the demands of and to manage expansion of its business and operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel as of february   the company had approximately full time employees 
the company s growth continues to place significant demands on its management resources 
the success of the company s business is dependent on the services of its senior management team 
the company has employment agreements with all of its executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of its executive 
table of contents officers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s performance depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high 
we cannot assure you that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
government regulation  potential impact of health care reform demand for the company s services is largely a function of the regulatory requirements associated with the approval of a new drug application by the fda 
these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate us standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s services 
several competing proposals to reform the system of health care delivery in the united states have been considered by congress from time to time 
none of the proposals have been adopted 
the fda s guidelines and rules related to the use of computerized systems in clinical trials are still in the early stages of development 
we cannot assure you that the datatrak process can be kept in compliance with these guidelines and rules as they develop 
any release of fda guidance that is significantly inconsistent with the design of datatrak edc may have a material adverse effect on the business and operations of datatrak 
competition the edc market  which is still developing  and must compete with the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  is highly fragmented 
the major competitors  in the edc market  include edc software vendors  clinical trial data service companies and in house development efforts within large pharmaceutical companies 
any current and potential future competitors have or may have substantially greater resources  greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged  thereby gaining market share or product acceptance to the company s detriment 
we cannot assure you that the company will be able to capture or establish the market presence necessary to effectively compete in this emerging sector of the clinical research industry 
potential liability from operations datatrak s services are supported by telecommunications equipment  software  operating protocols and proprietary applications for high speed transmission of large quantities of data among multiple locations 
in addition  clinical pharmaceutical and medical device research requires the review and handling of large amounts of patient data 
potential liability may arise from a breach of contract or a loss of or unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
to date  datatrak has not received any claims resulting from either errors in data handling or professional malpractice 
the company maintains an errors and omissions professional liability policy it believes to be sufficient to cover claims that may be brought against it 
we cannot assure you that this coverage will be adequate or that insurance will continue to be available 
demand for and market acceptance of the internet and its infrastructure development the increased use of the internet for retrieving  sharing and transferring information among businesses  consumers  suppliers and partners  and for internet content delivery services has only begun to develop in recent years 
datatrak s success will depend in large part on continued growth in the use of the internet 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet remain unresolved and are likely to affect the development of the market for the company s services 
the adoption of the internet for information retrieval and exchange  commerce and communications generally will require the acceptance of a new medium of conducting business and exchanging information 
demand for and market acceptance of the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty and are dependent on a number of factors 
if the 
table of contents market for internet content delivery services or the internet as a commercial or business medium does not develop  or develops more slowly than expected  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
anti takeover provisions  preferred share purchase rights the company s articles of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may discourage a third party from acquiring  or attempting to acquire the company 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for common shares 
in addition  preferred shares can be issued by the company s board of directors  without shareholder approval  whether under the company s shareholder rights plan or for other uses determined by the board 
the issuance of preferred shares may adversely affect the rights of common shareholders  the market price of the common shares and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding common shares 
at the present time  the company does not plan to issue any preferred shares 
general economic conditions to date the company believes that conditions such as the rate of employment  inflation  interest rates  and the condition of the capital markets have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
however any change in these conditions could adversely effect the carrying value of the company s short term investments  its results of operations or financial condition 
foreign currency the company s foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which the company regularly transacts business 
the company does not currently hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
any adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates for those currencies in which the company regularly transacts business could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
