item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on research and development of our drug  levulan r  combined with exposure to light  to treat and detect various medical conditions 
from our inception in until september we were classified as a development stage enterprise 
however  in late september  we launched our first commercial products  levulan r kerastick r topical solution and the blu u tm brand light device  in cooperation with berlex laboratories  inc berlex  the united states affiliate of schering ag 
from the product launch through the end of the year  dusa entered into over contracts for blu u tm brand light units 
we primarily lease the blu u tm to physicians  medical institutions and academic centers throughout the country 
now that our products have been launched  we are no longer classified as a development stage enterprise and  accordingly  the development stage disclosures have been eliminated from the accompanying financial statements 
we have primarily devoted our resources to funding research and development in order to advance the levulan r pdt pd technology platform  and as a result  we have experienced significant operating losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  our transition from a development stage company to a profitable operating company is dependent upon  among other things  the market penetration by berlex of our products and our ability to meet the supply needs of the growing customer base 
while schering ag has significant expertise in dermatology markets outside the united states  and berlex has significant expertise in non dermatology markets in the united states  our products represent berlex s first dermatology marketing effort in the united states 
at the current time  berlex has hired and trained sales representatives and area managers who are dedicated to the levulan r pdt system 
we are excited about the early positive response from physicians and patients who have used our therapy  but we do not expect full market penetration until after third party reimbursement costs for our products are established during the coming months by insurance companies and state and federal healthcare agencies 
currently  we are meeting berlex s supply requirements  however  any significant delays in delivery of sufficient product supplies from our sole source third party suppliers of levulan r  the kerastick r and or the blu u tm  once reimbursement policies are determined  would have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 
we are increasing our inventory of raw materials and products to help us manage the marketplace as it develops  and in february we leased additional space in our wilmington  massachusetts facilities to provide immediate warehouse  office space  and production areas should we need to develop our own manufacturing capabilities 
we are also investigating other suppliers for components of our products so that we could react more quickly if our supply was interrupted for any reason 
dusa s research and development efforts are continuing to expand  both in dermatology in partnership with schering ag  and in our internal indication development programs 
during  we doubled our staff to a total of full time employees by year end  in order to support all activities relating to production  maintenance  customer support for our initial and future products  as well as the research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
we expect that we will continue to significantly increase our staff during while our financial position is strong following a private placement early in and receipt of  of payments from schering ag in december  dusa cannot precisely predict when royalties and supply fees that we are entitled to under our schering ag agreement  along with interest and or other income  may offset the cost of these efforts 
in june  we amended our supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the supplier of our bulk drug product  to include an option to allow us to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years until december  as consideration for the amendment  we agreed to reimburse sochinaz for a portion of its costs to bring its manufacturing facilities into compliance with the fda cgmps 
we paid  in cash and issued  shares of our common stock having a fair market value of  while we can obtain alternative supply sources in certain circumstances  any new supplier would have to be inspected and qualified by the fda 
the total  has been reported as deferred charges and is being amortized over the original term of the supply agreement which would have expired on december  also during the year  we terminated our shareholders rights plan and redeemed all of the rights that were outstanding at a cost of approximately for non dermatology indications  we may enter into joint development or licensing arrangements  both domestically and internationally  with pharmaceutical companies 
to the extent that we do not enter into such arrangements  we may require separate funding to complete the regulatory approval process for non dermatology products and would likely need additional funds to market these potential products 
see risk factors we must receive separate approval for each of our potential products before we can sell them commercially in the united states or abroad  and if we are unable to obtain the necessary capital to fund our operations  we will have to delay our development programs and may not be able to complete our clinical trials 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues revenue recognized by dusa in was  reflecting its first sales of the kerastick r based on its product launch in september this amount includes research and development revenue of  reflecting revenue earned payments from schering ag to support our dermatology co development program and  representing the amortization of milestone and unrestricted grant payments also from schering ag 
the total amount of up front payments has been recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and is recognized as income on a straight line basis over the term of the company s alliance agreement with schering ag 
no revenue was recognized in and as dusa was a development stage corporation 
product sales during were  primarily reflecting the sales of the kerastick r 
the royalties are earned and recognized by dusa when the kerastick r is sold by berlex to its distributor  and are due and payable to dusa during the quarter following the quarter in which the sales are made 
dusa recognizes supply fee revenue related to these sales when dusa s supplier ships the kerastick r to berlex 
we primarily lease the blu u tm to our customers and have engaged a medical device leasing company to complete the leasing transactions  including coordinating payment plans with the physicians 
we sell the blu u tm s to the leasing company  which pays us for the units within thirty days after installation in the physician s offices 
however  because physicians have the right to cancel their leases after one year  these revenues are reported as deferred revenues until the right to cancel the lease has expired 
in the event a customer does cancel a lease  we have agreed to repurchase the units at an agreed upon price 
under this arrangement  we will recognize revenue from the distribution of blu u tm s beginning in late under our agreement with schering ag  two thirds of the agreed upon dermatology research and development expenses  up to  per year  are reimbursable to dusa by schering ag  for and based on the agreed upon development plan and the timing of the start of the clinical trials  we are entitled to reimbursement of  for the year ended december  in early  both parties agreed upon the development program that will be subject to reimbursement for the total research and development budget for approved co development projects so far totals  for  which will entitle us to a reimbursement from schering of  we expect that schering ag will continue to share the dermatology research and development costs beyond this year 
however  the level of reimbursement is not guaranteed under our agreement 
cost of product sales cost of product sales for the year ended december  were  primarily reflecting kerastick r sales to berlex in the amount of  and royalties and supply fees of approximately  reflecting minimum royalty payments due to dusa s licensor 
also included in cost of product sales is the amortization of deferred charges of approximately  reflecting consideration paid by us to amend our supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the manufacturer of the bulk drug ingredient used in levulan r  as well as costs incurred for shipping and installing the blu u tm in physician s offices 
inventory costs related to the blu u tm units that are leased are deferred and recorded as other current assets until the customer s right to cancel its lease after one year expires 
as of december   deferred inventory costs were  there were no product sales and therefore no cost of product sales during or in order to meet the production scheduling needs of our third party manufacturer of the blu u tm  we have agreed to prepay for raw material costs in the amount of  associated with our current orders 
this amount will be credited against the final purchase price  which will be due on delivery of finished units at the rate of  per unit 
in addition  if we do not order a certain number of blu u tm brand units for delivery in  we have agreed to pay  to our manufacturer for certain overhead costs 
we do not know at this time whether we will be required to make this payment as we depend upon berlex to market our products 
similarly  in early  we tentatively agreed to compensate our third party manufacturer of the kerastick r on an interim basis for certain overhead expenses if our orders fall below certain levels on an annual basis 
research and development costs dusa s research and development costs for the years ended  and  were   and  respectively 
the  increase in over levels is mainly attributed to manufacturing development expenses  reflecting increased personnel costs and pre production activities 
as stated above under revenue  under our agreement with schering ag  approximately two thirds of the agreed upon dermatology research and development expenses  up to  for  are reimbursable to dusa by schering ag 
the decrease in research and development costs from to reflected our efforts to delay some of our research programs while we were awaiting fda approval of our first product and completion of a dermatology corporate alliance 
dusa expects that research and development costs will increase as compared to due to increased expenditures for dermatology and internal indications coupled with a full year of higher personnel costs related to manufacturing development activities 
costs and development fees associated with agreements for research projects and clinical studies commit us to make payments of   and  for  and  respectively 
see note d to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as we implement our dermatology program with schering ag  and expand our internal indication programs  we expect clinical research and development expenses to increase significantly 
in late  we initiated a phase i ii clinical trial of levulan r pdt for moderate to severe acne vulgaris of the face  and we expect to begin clinical studies on onychomycosis  initially testing drug uptake and conversion in infected nails  shortly 
in addition  dusa plans to initiate clinical trials using levulan r pdt for treatment of warts during with respect to internal indications for levulan r pdt  we intend to initiate new dusa sponsored clinical protocols for the treatment of barrett s esophagus and brain cancer during dusa is also supporting and collaborating in new investigator studies on barrett s esophagus and restenosis inhibition 
additional indications being considered for further development include detection and treatment of cervical dysplasia and dysfunctional uterine bleeding 
based upon a survey of urologists that followed our initial bladder cancer photodetection study  we believe that this indication would require significant development efforts with respect to a more flexible light device  as well as a different drug formulation and we may seek an alliance partner to pursue this indication 
we have not yet decided on further development plans for this indication 
general and administrative costs 
general and administration expenses for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
during  the company hired additional staff  including key management personnel in technical and operations functions 
these costs are expected to continue to increase significantly for  then more slowly as we continue to add personnel at all levels of the organization 
interest income 
interest income was   and  for the periods ended december   and  respectively  and is primarily earned on united states government securities 
the  increase in interest income for as compared to is mainly attributed to the  received from schering ag during the fourth quarter of  and the net proceeds of approximately  received from a private placement in march interest income is expected to increase in due to additional payments of  received from schering in december however  if our product sales  which are dependent upon the market penetration by berlex and our ability to meet the supply needs of the growing customer base do not offset our expenditures  interest income will decline as funds are spent for our research and development programs 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  a provision for taxes of  was recorded primarily reflecting various states net worth tax 
a provision for alternative minimum tax was recorded in for  net losses the company incurred a net loss of  or per share   or 
per share  and  or 
per share for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses were within management s expectations and losses are expected to be incurred until the successful market penetration of our first products 
quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively quarterly results for year ended december  march  june september december total revenues     loss from operations     net loss     basic and diluted loss per share quarterly results for year ended december  march june september december total revenues loss from operations     net loss     basic and diluted loss per share recently issued accounting guidance in december  the staff of the securities exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec and summarizes certain of the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles gaap to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we adopted sab as of january  and we apply these revenue recognition policies in accordance with gaap 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standard  which must be adopted on january   requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
liquidity and capital resources we are in a strong cash position to continue and expand our research and development activities for our levulan r pdt pd platform 
our total assets were  as of december  compared to  as of december  the increase is the direct result of the completion of the private placement of the company s shares in the first quarter of this year and the receipt of  in milestone and research support payments from schering ag 
these payments from schering ag were based upon the parties marketing  development and supply agreement entered on november  and consisted of an  unrestricted research grant for future research and development support to be used at its discretion  and an additional milestone payment of  based upon the first commercial sale of our products 
these are the final payments related to dusa s initial products  the levulan r kerastick r topical solution  and the blu u tm brand light device  for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses of the face or scalp 
as of december   we had inventory of  representing finished goods  raw material and purchased parts and subassemblies 
also  as of the same date  we had net fixed assets of  as compared to  as of december   due primarily to the acquisition of equipment 
we expect to make significant additional capital expenditures during in order to acquire equipment for a back up second source of supply for the manufacture of the kerastick r  as required under our contract with schering ag 
as of december   we had accounts receivable of  representing net sales associated with product sales 
in addition  based on our co development program with schering ag  a receivable of  has been recorded as a current asset 
as of december   we had current liabilities of  as compared to  as of december  since our inception  we have had no long term debt 
dusa has a secured line of credit from schering ag for up to million to help us finance inventory purchases of our blu u tm from our supplier 
this line of credit is interest free but must be re paid within one year of our first draw down of funds 
as of the end of the year  we had not drawn down any part of this credit facility 
we invest our cash in united states government securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
these securities have an aggregate cost of  and a current aggregate market value of  as of december   resulting in a net unrealized gain on securities available for sale of  which has been included in shareholders equity 
as of december   government securities had an aggregate cost of  and an aggregate market value of  resulting in a net unrealized loss of  due to fluctuations in interest rates and depending upon the timing of our need to convert government securities into cash to meet our working capital requirements  some gains or losses could be realized 
these securities currently have interest rates and yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to august  we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to proceed with our current development program for levulan r pdt pd for the foreseeable future 
we have invested our funds in liquid investments  so that we will have ready access to these cash reserves  as needed  for the funding of development plans on a short term and long term basis 
dusa may also use its resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  technologies  or products that enhance or expand dusa s business 
as of december   dusa had deferred revenues of  compared to  at december  reflecting milestone and unrestricted grant payments of  including a premium of on the issuance of shares of dusa s common stock to a schering ag affiliate and the deferral of  in product sales related to our customer s one year right of return on leases of our commercial light sources 
commencing with our product launch  we began to amortize the schering ag milestone and unrestricted grant payments during the fourth quarter of  when the first products were placed in physicians offices 
the amortization period is expected to be approximately years  the term of the schering ag agreement  based upon current revenue recognition principles 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our management team is currently focusing its attention on providing support to berlex in its effort to penetrate the marketplace with our unique levulan r pdt therapy for aks  on conducting the expanded dermatology co development program with schering ag and on developing plans for several internal research and development indications 
full development and testing of all potential indications that are currently under development or being considered for development may require additional funding 
the timing of expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including progress of our research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  the level of sales of our first products any new additional collaborative arrangements  if any  we may enter  and the availability of other financing 
we cannot accurately predict the magnitude of revenues from sales of our products 
while the net proceeds of the january and march offerings coupled with payments received from schering ag will enable us to maintain our current research program as planned and support the commercialization of levulan r pdt for aks for the foreseeable future  in order to maintain and expand continuing research and development programs  dusa may need to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources  depending upon the amount of revenues we receive from our first product 
if sufficient funds are available  we may also use our resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  technologies  or products that complement  enhance  or expand our business 
we continue to actively seek relationships with pharmaceutical or other suitable organizations to market some of our potential non dermatology products and technologies  or to provide funding for research projects 
as of the end of  we had full time employees 
we have employment agreements with several of our key executive officers 
we have purchased and are the named beneficiary of a key man life insurance  having a face value of cdn million on the life of our president 
we expect that we will continue to hire or retain significantly more employees and consultants as commercialization of levulan r pdt continues  particularly in the operations  financial and regulatory areas 
we have not made any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near term 
if we decide  in the future  to establish a limited production line for the manufacture of the kerastick r  we expect that environmental laws will govern our facility  but we do not expect these laws to require material capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that our operations  business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
see business government regulation 
inflation although inflation rates have been comparatively low in recent years  inflation is expected to apply upward pressure on our operating costs 
we have included an inflation factor in our cost estimates 
however  the overall net effect of inflation on our operations is expected to be minimal 
market risk we hold fixed income us government securities that are subject to interest rate market risks 
however  we do not believe that the risk is material as we make our investments in relatively short term instruments and we strive to match the maturity dates of these instruments to our cash flow needs 
a ten percent decline in the average yield of these instruments would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows
