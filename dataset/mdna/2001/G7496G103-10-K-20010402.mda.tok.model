item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   and for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  and also a discussion of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this filing 
this filing contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results described or implied by these forward looking statements 
overview founded in  renaissancere is one of the leading providers of property catastrophe reinsurance coverage in the world 
we believe that we are a provider of first choice for many insurers and reinsurers  due to our modeling and technical expertise and our industry leading performance 
we principally provide property catastrophe reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers  with exposures worldwide  on an excess of loss basis 
property catastrophe reinsurance generally provides protection from claims arising from large catastrophes  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornados and other man made or natural disasters 
for the years ended december  and december   our gross premiums written were approximately million and million  respectively  our net premiums written were million and million  respectively  our operating income was million or per share and million or per share  respectively  and our net income was million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
at december   we had total assets of billion and total shareholders equity of million 
our principal subsidiary is renaissance reinsurance  a bermuda domiciled company 
in  renaissance reinsurance wrote million of gross written premiums  compared to million in of these premiums  million were derived from property catastrophe reinsurance coverage  compared to million in renaissance reinsurance is one of the largest providers of this coverage in the world 
in addition to property catastrophe reinsurance  we write certain specialty lines of reinsurance  including accident and health  finite  satellite and aviation 
in january  renaissance reinsurance formed top layer re with state farm to provide high layer coverage for non us risks 
renaissance reinsurance and state farm each own of top layer re 
opcat is a wholly owned subsidiary of overseas partners 
in november  renaissancere incorporated renaissance underwriting managers to act as underwriting manager to opcat 
together  these joint ventures have access to approximately billion of capital 
we receive profit participation and fee based income from these ventures 
we believe that our position as a leading property catastrophe reinsurance underwriter has been strengthened by the growth in total managed catastrophe premiums we experienced in our total managed catastrophe premiums  which include premiums we write on behalf of our top layer re and opcat joint ventures together with those written by our wholly owned subsidiaries  grew to million on a gross basis for the year ended december   including million written on behalf of our joint ventures 
we also provide reinsurance coverage through renaissance reinsurance of europe 
renaissance europe was incorporated in under the laws of ireland as a wholly owned subsidiary of renaissance reinsurance 
we also write primary insurance and provide certain related services  principally in lines that are exposed to catastrophe risk 
our subsidiaries involved in primary insurance include glencoe insurance ltd  paget insurance services  pembroke managing agents  desoto insurance company  desoto prime insurance company and nobel insurance company 
glencoe was incorporated in as a wholly owned subsidiary of renaissancere 
glencoe provides primary catastrophe exposed property coverage on an excess and surplus lines basis  and is eligible to write business in states 
during  glencoe wrote million of primary insurance premium  compared to million in desoto insurance was incorporated in as a wholly owned subsidiary of glencoe  to assume and renew homeowner policies from the florida residential property and casualty joint underwriting association  a state sponsored insurance company 
during  desoto wrote million of primary homeowners insurance coverage  compared to million in paget  pembroke and desoto prime are all active in the florida homeowners market 
we also own nobel  a texas domiciled insurance company 
following a fourth quarter after tax charge of million  nobel disposed of its business lines in nobel continues to be a licensed insurer in all states  although there can be no assurance that these licenses can be retained 
our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of catastrophic events  and the coverage offered to clients impacted by these events 
in addition  from time to time  we may consider opportunistic diversification into new ventures  either through organic growth or the acquisition of other companies or books of business 
in evaluating such new ventures  we seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage and opportunities that will not detract from our core reinsurance operations 
accordingly  we regularly review strategic opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our operating income  which excludes realized gains and losses on investments  for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  our operating earnings per common share for the year ended december  was  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased fee income from our joint ventures  top layer re and opcat  and also from an increase in investment income due to increased yields and an increase in the size of the investment portfolio  slightly offset by an increase in interest expense 
our gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  gross premiums written by segment were year ended december  in thousands reinsurance   primary   total   our increase in reinsurance premiums written in resulted primarily from an increase of million in our premiums from noncatastrophe reinsurance  from million in to million in  an increase in reinstatement premiums to million in  compared with million in  primarily related to the european windstorms and increased opportunities to provide reinsurance to reinsurers due to the large level of catastrophes in premiums written by our primary insurance companies decreased due to the reduced premiums at nobel  from million in to million in  due to the run off of the nobel businesses 
during  we continued to purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to certain losses 
our ceded premiums were as follows year ended december  in thousands reinsurance   primary   total   the increase in ceded reinsurance was primarily the result of increased costs of ceded reinsurance contracts renewed by renaissance reinsurance and increased purchases of reinsurance by renaissance reinsurance 
the reduction in ceded reinsurance by our primary insurance companies primarily relates to the reduction in gross written premiums from nobel 
approximately of the limits under our reinsurance coverage has been purchased on a multi year basis  which we expect will result in relatively stable costs on the majority of those policies for the fiscal years and to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the potential volatility of our results 
our gross premiums written by geographic region were as follows year ended december  in thousands united states and caribbean   worldwide   worldwide excluding us   europe   other   australia and new zealand   noncatastrophe reinsurance   total reinsurance   united states primary   total gross premiums written   the category worldwide excluding us consists of contracts that cover more than one geographic region other than the us the exposure in this category for gross premiums written to date is predominantly from europe and japan 
the category noncatastrophe reinsurance includes coverages related to noncatastrophe reinsurance risks assumed by us 
these coverages primarily include exposure to claims from accident and health  finite  satellite and aviation risks assumed by us 
the table below sets forth our claims  expense and combined ratios year ended december  claims and claim expenses ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio our claims and claim expenses incurred for the year ended december  were million  or of net premiums earned 
in comparison  our claims and claim expenses incurred for the year ended december  were million  or of net premiums earned 
the primary reason for the increase in the claims and claim expenses ratio was the increase in gross premiums written from noncatastrophe reinsurance products which typically produce a higher loss ratio than our principal product  property catastrophe reinsurance 
due to the potential high severity of claims related to the property catastrophe reinsurance business  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience this level of claims in future years 
for our reinsurance operations  estimates of claims and claim expenses incurred and losses recoverable are based in part upon the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events 
our estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events based upon our own historical claim experience is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims 
therefore  we utilize both proprietary and commercially available models  as well as historical reinsurance industry property catastrophe claims experience  for purposes of evaluating future trends and providing an estimate of ultimate claims costs 
for both our reinsurance and primary operations  we use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate ultimate expected claims and claim expenses 
the period of time from the reporting of a loss to us through the settlement of our liability may be several years 
during this period  additional facts and trends will be revealed 
as these factors become apparent  case reserves will be adjusted  sometimes requiring an increase in our overall reserves  while at other times we may reallocate incurred but not reported ibnr reserves to specific case reserves 
reserve estimates are reviewed regularly  and such adjustments  if any  are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they become known and are accounted for as changes in estimates 
acquisition costs and operational expenses  consisting of brokerage commissions  excise taxes and other costs directly related to our underwriting operations  for the year ended december  were million  or of net premiums earned  compared with million  or of net premiums earned  for the year ended december  the primary contributor to the increase in the underwriting expense ratio was the increase in gross premiums earned by renaissance reinsurance with respect to noncatastrophe reinsurance products  which typically produce a higher underwriting expense ratio than our principal product  property catastrophe reinsurance 
net investment income which excludes net realized investment losses for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in investment income resulted primarily from an increase in interest rates during  together with an increase in the investment base during the year 
although invested assets at the end of the year only reflected an increase of million from the prior year end  we had an additional million available during most of the year  prior to repaying million on our bank loans during the fourth quarter 
during  we reported other income of million  compared with million for the year ended december  substantially all of this income related to our profit participation and performance based fees received by us from our joint ventures  top layer re and opcat 
also included in other income is approximately million from our primary operations  and million from our investments in non indemnity catastrophe index transactions 
for  we reported million in other income relating to recoveries on catastrophe linked index transactions and million relating to other income from our primary operations 
during  net realized losses on sales of investments were million  compared with million in the realized losses in and in were primarily the result of increased interest rates and the subsequent sales of fixed income securities 
corporate expenses were million in compared with million in  excluding the write off of goodwill attributable to nobel of million in and million in the primary cause of the increase was an increase in developmental expenses for our primary operations and other business development activities 
during the year ended december   we recorded interest expense of million on our outstanding debt compared with million in the increase in interest expense was primarily related to an increase in borrowing rates during late and early and additional borrowings of million which were outstanding for approximately five months during and for approximately eleven months during in the fourth quarter of  we repaid million of our outstanding debt 
also during  we recorded million of tax expense compared with a tax benefit of million in the increase in our tax expense primarily relates to a million deferred tax valuation allowance we recorded during primarily as a result of the losses from nobel  renaissance us holdings  inc has recorded a net deferred tax asset  the balance of which is million at december  we believe the future operations of nobel  combined with other operating subsidiaries of renaissance us  will enable us to utilize the remainder of this net operating loss carry forward 
however  it is not certain that we will realize the full benefit of this asset 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  our operating earnings per common share for the year ended december  was  compared with for the year ended december  our consolidated net operating income excludes the impact of net realized investment gains and losses on investments  as well as  in the case of  the fourth quarter charge of million related to nobel 
our gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  our gross premiums written by segment were year ended december  in thousands reinsurance   primary   total   our increased reinsurance premiums in resulted primarily from the numerous industry losses which occurred late in and during and the related contraction in capacity in the property catastrophe reinsurance market  which resulted in increased prices in certain pockets of the property catastrophe reinsurance market during the million  or  increase in premiums from our reinsurance operations was primarily the result of a increase in premiums related to new business and a increase related to changes in pricing  participation levels and coverage on renewed business  partially offset by a decrease in premiums because either we or the cedent did not renew coverage 
premiums written by our primary insurance companies increased in  largely because such results reflect a full year of premiums written for nobel  compared with only six months of nobel premiums during this increase was partially offset by reduced premiums written for desoto insurance in the reduction in desoto insurance premiums was due to the one time initial premiums assumed from the florida jua during of approximately million 
during nobel sold its principal operating units and  as a result  we expect a decrease in future premium volume from our primary insurance businesses 
during  we continued to purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to certain losses 
our ceded premiums were as follows year ended december  in thousands reinsurance   primary   total   the increase in ceded reinsurance was primarily the result of increased costs of ceded reinsurance contracts renewed by renaissance reinsurance  increased purchases of reinsurance by renaissance reinsurance and nobel ceding the large majority of its gross premiums written as part of the planned reduction of its operations 
nobel s ceded reinsurance was million in  compared with million during to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the potential volatility of our results 
our gross premiums written by geographic region were as follows year ended december  in thousands united states and caribbean   worldwide   worldwide excluding us   europe   other   australia and new zealand   noncatastrophe reinsurance   total reinsurance   united states primary   total gross premiums written   the category worldwide excluding us consists of contracts that cover more than one geographic region other than the us the exposure in this category for gross premiums written to date is predominantly from europe and japan 
the category noncatastrophe reinsurance includes coverages related to noncatastrophe reinsurance risks assumed by us 
these coverages primarily include exposure to claims from accident and health  finite  satellite and aviation risks assumed by us 
the table below sets forth our combined ratio and components thereof  excluding  in the case of  the nobel charge year ended december  claims and claim expenses ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio our claims and claim expenses incurred for the year ended december  were million  or  of net premiums earned 
in comparison  claims and claim expenses incurred for the year ended december  were million  or  of net premiums earned 
the primary reason for the increase in the net incurred losses was the significant catastrophe losses that occurred during during nine significant worldwide catastrophic events occurred the hail storms in sydney  australia  in april  the oklahoma tornados in may  hurricane floyd in september  typhoon bart which struck japan in september  turkish and taiwanese earthquakes in august and september  respectively  and the danish windstorm  anatol  and the french windstorms  lothar and martin  in december 
seven of these events each resulted in over billion of insured damages 
these events caused net incurred losses for renaissance reinsurance to increase to million for  or a loss ratio of  compared with million for  or a loss ratio of 
due to the potential high severity of claims related to the property catastrophe reinsurance business  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience this level of claims in future years 
renaissance reinsurance s incurred losses in included claims on a number of aggregate stop loss and excess of loss contracts  as well as claims related to hurricane georges  the january canadian freeze  hurricane bonnie and additional claims from various us wind  hail  tornado and flood events 
the claims and claim expenses incurred from our primary operations for the year ended december  were million  or a loss ratio of of net premiums earned 
in comparison  claims and claim expenses incurred from our primary operations for the year ended december  were million  or a loss ratio of 
during  desoto and glencoe continued to perform within targeted loss ratios 
the primary factor contributing to the reduction in net losses from our primary operations was the recognition of a portion of a deferred gain related to a retroactive reinsurance contract entered into by nobel during our combined ratio and components thereof exclude the nobel charge 
acquisition costs and operational expenses  consisting of brokerage commissions  excise taxes and other costs directly related to our underwriting operations  for the year ended december  were million  or  of net premiums earned  compared with million  or  of net premiums earned for the year ended december   excluding the nobel charge 
the primary contributor to the decrease in the underwriting expense ratio was the increase in premiums earned by renaissance reinsurance with no corresponding increase in the costs to operate the reinsurance operations 
this was slightly offset by increased costs at nobel  primarily related to severance costs  and increased costs at desoto insurance for additional hires 
net investment income which excludes net realized investment losses for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in investment income resulted primarily from an increase in interest rates during plus the million increase in the amount of invested assets during the year  which was primarily the result of cash flows provided by operations of million and an increase in the borrowings under our line of credit of million  partially offset by dividends paid and share repurchases of million and million  respectively 
during  we reported other income of million  compared with million for the year ended december  the majority of other income in relates to recoveries on non indemnity catastrophe index transactions 
during  our net realized losses on sales of investments were million  compared with million in the losses were primarily the result of increased interest rates during and the subsequent sales of fixed income securities 
excluding a write off of goodwill attributable to nobel  corporate expenses were million in  compared with million in during  in conjunction with the sale and reinsurance of the primary business units of nobel  we wrote off million of goodwill 
the amount excludes charges related to nobel 
during the year ended december   we recorded interest expense of million on our outstanding debt and million on our capital trust securities  compared with million and million in  respectively 
the increase in interest expense on our outstanding debt was primarily related to an increase in borrowing rates and the additional borrowings of million during  million of which was drawn on august  on june   we completed our acquisition of the us operating subsidiaries including nobel of nobel insurance limited  a bermuda company  for million 
we accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
we did not issue shares as part of the purchase 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an after tax charge of million  consisting of million of adverse development on nobel s casualty and surety books of business  a goodwill write down of million  and other related costs of million 
consequently  we adopted a plan to exit each of nobel s business units 
subsequently  nobel completed the reinsurance of the casualty and surety books of business and its bail and low value dwelling books of business have been assumed by third parties 
also  nobel completed the sale of its ias cat crew subsidiary to its management team in an earn out transaction 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  we rely on investment income  cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt  cash distributions on outstanding obligations and to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under us statutory regulations and bermuda insurance law 
us statutory regulations and the bermuda insurance act  amendments thereto and related regulations of bermuda require our bermuda insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries was million  and the amount required to be maintained by the act was million 
during  renaissance reinsurance paid aggregate cash dividends of million to our parent company  compared with million in our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide sufficient liquidity to meet extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
additionally  we maintain a million credit facility to meet the liquidity needs of our subsidiaries 
we had drawn down million of this facility at december  in connection with the nobel acquisition  renaissance us borrowed million from a syndicate of banks 
in addition  the banks provided a million revolving loan facility 
at december   million was outstanding under these lines 
renaissancere has guaranteed these borrowings 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities resulted principally from premiums  collections on losses recoverable and investment income  net of paid losses  acquisition costs and underwriting expenses 
cash flows from operations in were million  compared with million in the cash flows from operations were primarily utilized to purchase million of our common shares  pay aggregate quarterly dividends of million and repay million of our bank loans 
our cash flows from operations were primarily utilized to purchase million of our common shares and pay aggregate quarterly dividends of million 
also during  we borrowed an additional million under our revolving credit facility  which was primarily used to purchase additional fixed income securities for the holding company s portfolio of investments 
we have generated cash flows from operations in and in significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
to the extent that capital is not utilized in our reinsurance business  we will consider using such capital to invest in new opportunities or will consider returning such capital to our shareholders 
because of the nature of the coverages we provide  which typically can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
capital resources our total capital resources at december  and were as follows at december  in thousands shareholders equity   revolving credit facility unborrowed   revolving credit facility borrowed   term and revolving loan facility   minority interest capital securities   total capital resources   we have a revolving credit and term loan agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks 
during we increased our borrowings under the facility to million from million at december  the additional funds drawn during increased the liquidity at the holding company  renaissancere  and were available  if necessary  to be contributed to the operating subsidiaries following a large catastrophic event 
during  we renegotiated our revolving credit facility and repaid million of the then outstanding balance 
interest rates on the facility are based on a spread above libor and averaged during  compared to in our revolving credit agreement contains certain financial covenants including requirements that consolidated debt to capital does not exceed a ratio of  consolidated net worth must exceed the greater of million or of consolidated debt  and of invested assets must be rated bbb or better 
under the terms of the agreement  and if we are in compliance with the covenants thereunder  we have access to the million 
we were in compliance with all the covenants of this revolving credit and term loan agreement at december  renaissance us has a million term loan and million revolving loan facility with a syndicate of commercial banks  each of which is guaranteed by renaissancere 
interest rates on the facility are based upon a spread above libor  and averaged during  compared to in the related agreements contain certain financial covenants  including a covenant that renaissancere  as principal guarantor  maintain a ratio of liquid assets to debt service of the term loan has mandatory repayment provisions approximating million per year in each of years through during  renaissance us repaid approximately million of this facility 
we were in compliance with all the covenants of this term loan and revolving loan facility at december our subsidiary renaissancere capital trust has issued capital securities which pay cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of  payable semi annually 
during we purchased million of these capital securities recognizing a gain of million which has been reflected in shareholders equity 
during we purchased million of these capital securities recognizing a gain of million which was also reflected in shareholders equity 
the sole asset of the trust consists of our junior subordinated debentures in an amount equal to the outstanding capital securities 
the indenture relating to these junior subordinated debentures contains certain covenants  including a covenant prohibiting us from the payment of dividends if we are in default under the indenture 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture at december  the capital trust securities mature on march  these securities are required by accounting principles to be classified as minority interest  rather than as a component of our shareholders equity 
under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  we may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
we have obtained a facility providing for the issuance of letters of credit 
this facility is secured by a lien on a portion of our investment portfolio 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit aggregating million  compared to million in also  in connection with our top layer re joint venture we have committed million of collateral to support a letter of credit 
in order to encourage employee ownership of common shares  we have guaranteed certain loan and pledge agreements between certain employees and bank of america illinois 
pursuant to the terms of this employee credit facility  bofa has agreed to loan the participating employees up to an aggregate of million 
the balance outstanding at december  was million  compared to million in each loan under this employee credit facility is required to be initially collateralized by the respective participating employee with common shares or other collateral acceptable to bofa 
if the value of the collateral provided by a participating employee subsequently decreases  the participating employee is required to contribute additional collateral in the amount of such deficiency 
loans under this employee credit facility are otherwise non recourse to the participating employees 
given the level of collateral  we do not presently anticipate that we will be required to honor any guarantees under the employee credit facility  although there can be no assurance that we will not be so required in the future 
shareholders equity during  shareholders equity increased by million  from million at december   to million at december  the significant components of the change in shareholders equity included net income from continuing operations of million  plus an increase in unrealized appreciation on investments of million  offset by the payment of dividends of million and the purchase of common shares for million 
from time to time  we have sought to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchase programs 
we currently have million remaining under our existing programs 
during  we purchased  common shares for an aggregate value of million 
during  we repurchased  common shares for an aggregate value of million 
during  we purchased  common shares for an aggregate value of million 
investments at december   we held cash and investments totaling  million  compared to  million in  with net unrealized appreciation of million  compared to unrealized loss of million in because we primarily provide coverage for damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  we may become liable for substantial claim payments 
accordingly  our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity 
the table below shows the aggregate amounts of investments available for sale  other investments and cash and cash equivalents comprising our portfolio of invested assets at december  in thousands investments available for sale  at fair value   other investments   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments   total invested assets   the growth in our portfolio of invested assets for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by payments of million under our revolving credit facility  million of dividends paid and million of common share repurchases 
our investment income also increased during this period  largely as a result of the increased size of the fixed income portfolio and an increase in interest rates 
our current investment guidelines call for the invested asset portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  to have at least an average aa rating as measured by standard poor s ratings group 
at december   our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa  an average duration of years and an average yield to maturity of 
catastrophe linked instruments 
we have assumed risk through catastrophe and weather linked securities and derivative instruments under which losses could be triggered by an industry loss index or natural parameters 
to date we have not experienced any losses from such securities or derivatives 
we can not assure you that this performance will continue 
during and  we recorded recoveries on non indemnity catastrophe index transactions of million and million  respectively 
we report these recoveries in other income 
derivative securities 
in order to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations  we have entered into forward window contracts to hedge our foreign currency outstanding loss reserves 
at december   based on market information and information provided by independent brokers  the estimated fair value of these contracts is million 
the aggregate notional amount of the contracts at december  is million 
market sensitive instruments our investment portfolio includes investments which are subject to changes in market values with changes in interest rates 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in total return of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million at december  at december   the decrease in total return would have been  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at  million 
the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
currency our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience exchange gains and losses and incur underwriting losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our financial statements 
our current foreign currency policy is to hold foreign currency assets  including cash and receivables  that approximate the net monetary foreign currency liabilities  including loss reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
all changes in the exchange rates are recognized currently in our statement of income 
we seek to hedge our exposure to foreign currency transactions 
effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results can not be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
new accounting pronouncement effective january  we implemented sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
current outlook due to industry losses in  and the related contraction of capacity in the market  we received price increases on a substantial majority of our reinsurance policies sold or renewed during the recent renewal season 
however  even after these price increases  we believe that there continues to be numerous transactions in the market that are underpriced relative to expected losses 
we believe that because of our competitive advantages  including our technological capabilities and our relationships with leading brokers and ceding companies  we are able to identify contracts that are adequately priced and will continue to find opportunities in the property catastrophe reinsurance markets 
primarily because of higher than average loss activity in  our aggregate cost for reinsurance protection increased during and could continue to increase during if prices rise to levels whereby we believe the purchase of reinsurance protection would become uneconomical  then in certain geographic regions we would retain a greater level of net risk 
in order to give us longer term retrocessional capacity  we have entered into multi year contracts with respect to a portion of our portfolio 
as of january   approximately of the limits under our retrocessional coverage were purchased on a multi year basis 
our financial strength and underwriting expertise have enabled us to pursue opportunities outside the property catastrophe reinsurance market  including various lines of reinsurance and the catastrophe exposed primary insurance market 
we believe that our financial strength will enable us to continue to pursue other opportunities in the future 
there can be no assurance that our pursuit of such opportunities will materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
during recent fiscal years there has been considerable consolidation among leading brokerage firms and also among our customers 
although consolidation may continue to occur  we believe that our financial strength  our position as one of the market leaders in the property catastrophe reinsurance industry and our ability to provide innovative products to the industry will minimize any adverse effect of such consolidation on our business
