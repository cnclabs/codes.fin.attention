factors affecting comparability 
our condensed consolidated statements of earnings include the results of operations of chicago title for the period from march   the merger date  through december  as a result  year over year comparisons may not be meaningful 
excluding the effect of the chicago title merger  our title insurance premiums for the year ended december  were million 
we have also reviewed our existing non title operations in connection with the merger and related transition and integration 
as a result  during the first quarter of we recorded certain non recurring charges totaling million  after applicable taxes 
these charges primarily relate to the revaluation of non title assets  including our investment in express network  inc  which was sold in the second quarter of  and existing goodwill associated with express network and the write off of obsolete software 
overview 
the following table presents certain financial data for the years indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands total revenue    total expenses    net earnings    net earnings for year ended december  were million  or per diluted share 
excluding the non recurring  non title related charges we recorded in the first quarter of of million  or per diluted share  net earnings for year ended december   were million  or per diluted share  as compared with net earnings for the corresponding periods in and of million  or per diluted share and million  or per diluted share 
the following table presents the calculation of earnings before amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired and non recurring charges 
we believe that earnings before amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired and non recurring charges better reflects the operational performance of our business

the following table presents the components of our revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands title insurance premiums    escrow and other title related fees    real estate related services    interest and investment income  including realized gains and losses    other income    total revenue    orders opened by direct operations    orders closed by direct operations    title insurance revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales on both a national and local basis 
real estate sales are directly affected by changes in the cost of financing purchases of real estate ie  mortgage interest rates 
other macroeconomic factors affecting real estate activity include  but are not limited to  demand for housing  employment levels  family income levels and general economic conditions 
because these factors can change dramatically  revenue levels in the title insurance industry can also change dramatically 
for example  beginning in late and into  the level of real estate activity increased  including refinancing transactions  new home sales and resales  due in part to decreases in mortgage interest rates 
stable mortgage interest rates and strength in the real estate market  especially in california and throughout the west coast  contributed to very positive conditions for the title insurance industry throughout and however  during the second half of and through  steady interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board resulted in a significant decline in refinancing transactions  which shifted the real estate market from a refinance driven market to a more traditional market driven by new home purchases and resales 
as a result of the shift in mix of business along with the steady increases in interest rates  total title premiums  on a pro forma basis assuming the chicago title merger occurred on january  have decreased in as compared with pro forma title insurance premiums 
total revenue in more than doubled to  million from  million in total revenue in of  million reflects a increase from revenue of  million 
the increase in total revenue from to is primarily the result of the merger of chicago title on march  the increase in total revenue from to is primarily the result of continued strength in our core title and real estate related service operations  which were positively impacted by favorable market conditions leading to an increase in real estate activity 
the increased real estate activity combined with acquisitions of real estate related service companies and the integration of those real estate related service operations into our core businesses  also contributed to increased revenue 
title insurance premiums increased to  million in from million in in  title premiums increased from million in the premium increases from to were indicative of the favorable market conditions existing during that period 
in  refinance transactions declined from record levels in to levels consistent with historical norms due to interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board 
increases in mortgage interest rates were partially offset by consumer confidence in the overall economy  which resulted in record home sales in as the volume of refinance transactions decreased  the market shifted  beginning in the second half of and continuing through  from a refinance driven market to a more traditional market driven by new home purchases and resales 
in  the decrease in real estate market activity was more than offset by the addition of the chicago title operations and an increase in the average fee per file 
the increase in fee per file is consistent with a return to more normalized levels of refinance activity and the continuing increase in home prices  as well as increased commercial activity as we continue to grow our national commercial division 
the addition of the chicago tile operations during has also impacted the mix of business between our direct and agency operations as compared with prior years 
the following table presents the percentages of title insurance premiums generated by our direct and agency operations year ended december  amounts amount amount dollars in thousands direct    agency    total title insurance premiums    trends in escrow and other title related fees are primarily related to title insurance activity generated by our direct operations 
escrow and other title related fees during the three year period ended december   fluctuated in a pattern generally consistent with the fluctuation in direct title insurance premiums and order counts 
escrow and other title related fees were million  million and million  respectively  during  and revenues from real estate related services generally trend closely with the level and mix of business  as well as the performance of our title related subsidiaries 
during and  we acquired real estate related service companies in various separate transactions 
our strategy in making the real estate related service company acquisitions was to acquire previously existing entities in businesses we believed to be complementary to our core title and escrow businesses 
revenues from real estate related services in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenues from real estate related services in is primarily the result of the acquisition of chicago title as well as increases in revenue from our credit reporting  flood certification  home warranty insurance and tax qualifying property exchange services 
interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of securities markets  interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment 
in  interest and investment income was million  compared with million in the increase in interest and investment income earned during is primarily due to an increase in average invested assets  excluding real estate  from million in to  million in  primarily as a result of the chicago title acquisition 
the tax equivalent yield in  excluding realized losses  was 
included in interest and investment income in is of net realized losses 
interest and investment income in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million  or 
average invested assets  excluding real estate  increased to million  from million in the tax equivalent yield in  excluding net realized losses  was 
the decrease in investment income in from is the result of net realized losses in of  compared with net realized gains in of million  offset by an increase in interest and dividend income generated by the increased invested asset base and interest rate increases during the year 
included in net realized gains is a gain from the conversion of our investment in data tree corporation of approximately million 
other income represents revenue generated by micro general  our majority owned information services subsidiary  fnf capital  our equipment leasing subsidiary and express network 
other income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in other income in is due to the sale of express network in the second quarter of as well as decreases in externally generated revenue by micro general 
other income increased in from as a result of including micro general in our results of operations beginning in may as well as increases in externally generated revenue by micro general in as compared with expenses 
the following table presents the components of our expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands personnel costs    other operating expenses    agent commissions    provision for claim losses    interest expense    amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired    total expenses    our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  other operating expenses and agent commissions  which are incurred as orders are received and processed 
title insurance premiums  escrow and other title related fees are generally recognized as income at the time the underlying transaction closes 
as a result  revenue lags approximately days behind expenses and therefore gross margins may fluctuate 
the changes in the market environment  mix of business between direct and agency operations and the contributions from our various business units have impacted margins and net earnings 
we have implemented programs and have taken necessary actions to maintain expense levels consistent with revenue 
however  a short time lag does exist in reducing variable costs and certain fixed costs are incurred regardless of revenue levels 
personnel costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and are one of our most significant operating expenses 
these costs generally fluctuate with the level of orders opened and closed and with the mix of revenue 
personnel costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
personnel costs as a percentage of total revenue have remained relatively consistent over the three year period ended december  those percentages were in  in and in we have taken significant measures to maintain appropriate personnel levels and costs relative to the volume and mix of business while maintaining customer service standards and quality controls 
we will continue to monitor prevailing market conditions and will adjust personnel costs in accordance with activity 
other operating expenses consist primarily of facilities expenses  title plant maintenance  premium taxes which insurance underwriters are required to pay on title premiums in lieu of franchise and other state taxes  postage and courier services  computer services including personnel costs associated with information technology support  professional services  advertising expenses  general insurance  depreciation and trade and notes receivable allowances 
we continue to be committed to cost control measures 
in response to market conditions  we have implemented aggressive cost control programs in order to maintain operating expenses at levels consistent with the levels of revenue 
however  certain fixed costs are incurred regardless of revenue levels  resulting in period over period fluctuations 
our cost control programs are designed to evaluate expenses  both current and budgeted  relative to existing and projected market conditions 
other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in the decrease in other operating expenses in is attributable to the change in our cost structure as a result of the addition of the chicago title operations  which are primarily title and real estate related 
other operating expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in as a result of the impact of micro general s business expansion  increased data processing and information technology costs and normal year over year price increases including rent escalations  travel and other general and administrative costs 
total other operating expenses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts 
agent commissions and the resulting percentage of agent premiums we retain vary according to regional differences in real estate closing practices and state regulations 
the following table illustrates the relationship of agent premiums and agent commissions year ended december  amount amount amount dollars in thousands agent premiums    agent commissions    premiums we retain    the provision for claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title claims 
the estimate of anticipated title claims is accrued as a percentage of title premium revenue based on our historical loss experience and other relevant factors 
we monitor our claims loss experience on a continual basis and adjust the provision for claim losses accordingly 
based on our loss development studies  we believe that as a result of our underwriting and claims handling practices  as well as the refinancing business of prior years  we will maintain the claim loss trends we have experienced over the past several years 
as such  our claim loss provision as a percentage of total title premiums was in  as compared with in and in a summary of the reserve for claim losses follows year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance    reserves assumed  reserves transferred  claim loss provision related to current year    prior years   total claim loss provision    claims paid  net of recoupments related to current year    prior years    total claims paid  net of recoupments    ending balance    provision for claim losses as a percentage of title insurance premiums in connection with the chicago title merger on march   we assumed chicago title s then outstanding reserve for claim losses 
on march   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell national title insurance of new york inc national to american title company  a wholly owned subsidiary of american national financial  inc anfi  for million  subject to regulatory approval and certain other conditions 
the purchase price was structured at a premium to book value 
as of december   the company holds a interest in anfi 
national was acquired in april  as part of the nations title inc acquisition  and has not been actively underwriting policies since that time 
this transaction received regulatory approval on may  and closed on june  the company recognized a gain of approximately million prior to applicable income taxes  in connection with the sale of national 
this gain has been reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december  the favorable development on prior year loss reserves during and was attributable to lower than expected payment levels on recent issue years which included a high proportion of refinance business 
interest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in as compared with is attributable to the increase in outstanding notes payable  primarily related to the financing of the chicago title merger  and an increase in certain indices on which our variable interest rates are based 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared with is primarily due to the redemption of our liquid yield option notes in in addition  included in interest expense in is a million interest charge relating to the settlement of an internal revenue service examination for the tax years through amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired was million in  million in and million in in connection with the merger of chicago title  we recorded cost in excess of net assets acquired of approximately million 
as a result  amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired has increased accordingly 
income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for  and was  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes is attributable to our estimate of ultimate income tax liability  the impact of the non recurring charges and the non deductible goodwill recorded pursuant to the chicago title merger and the characteristics of net earnings ie  operating income versus investment income 
liquidity and capital resources on march   we acquired chicago title 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  chicago title stockholders received aggregate merger consideration valued at approximately billion 
the merger consideration was paid in the form of shares of our common stock and in cash for each share of chicago title common stock  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock valued at an average price during the applicable period of per share and the payment of approximately million in cash 
in connection with the chicago title merger  we entered into a syndicated credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for three distinct credit facilities million  month revolving credit facility due september  million  year revolving credit facility due march   and million term loan facility with a year amortization period  due march  the credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate of interest based on the debt ratings assigned to us by certain independent agencies  and is unsecured 
the current interest rate is libor plus 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration  to refinance previously existing indebtedness  to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and to fund other general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement and other debt facilities impose certain affirmative and negative covenants on us relating to current debt ratings  certain financial ratios related to liquidity  net worth  capitalization  investments  acquisitions and restricted payments  and certain dividend restrictions 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of december  on january   we issued  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
proceeds from this offering  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other related expenses  were million 
net proceeds of million were used to repay in full and terminate the million  month revolving credit facility and net proceeds of million were used to pay down in full the million  year revolving credit facility 
the remainder of the cash proceeds are available for general corporate purposes 
our cash requirements include debt service  operating expenses  lease fundings  lease securitizations  taxes and dividends on our common stock 
we believe that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds  through cash dividends from subsidiaries  cash generated by investment securities and bank borrowings through existing credit facilities 
our short and long term liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
we forecast the daily needs of all of our subsidiaries and periodically review their short and long term projected sources and uses of funds  as well as the asset  liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
our two significant sources of our funds are dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  we receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursement for operating and other administrative expenses we incur 
the reimbursements are executed within the guidelines of management agreements among us and our subsidiaries 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in their ability to pay dividends and make distributions 
each state of domicile regulates the extent to which our title underwriters can pay dividends or make other distributions to us 
our underwritten title companies  real estate related service companies  micro general and fnf capital  collect revenue and pay operating expenses 
however  they are not regulated to the same extent as our insurance subsidiaries 
positive cash flow from these subsidiaries are invested primarily in cash and cash equivalents

emerging issues task force no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  eitf sets forth the rules for recognizing interest income on all credit sensitive mortgage and asset backed securities and certain prepayment sensitive securities including agency interest only strips  whether purchased or retained in securitization  and determining when these securities must be written down to fair value because of impairment 
eitf is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after march  early adoption is permitted 
we have decided not to early adopt eitf application of provisions of the eitf are to be adopted prospectively 
adoption of eitf will require impairments to the valuation of residual interest in securitizations to be recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the residual interests through a charge to earnings 
the initial potential impact of adoption would be a charge to earnings of approximately million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about the market risk of financial instruments our consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
see business investment policies and investment portfolio and notes c and g of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities as of our year ended december   interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information below  since actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because our reserve for claim losses representing of total liabilities is not included in the hypothetical effects 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments would have been as follows as of december  a 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of fixed maturity securities would have occurred if interest rates had decreased increased by basis points 
the change in fair values was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 
b 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of equity securities would have occurred if there was a price increase decrease in market prices 
c 
it is not anticipated that there would be a significant change in the fair value of other long term investments or short term investments if there was a change in market conditions  based on the nature and duration of the financial instruments involved 
d 
interest expense on average debt outstanding would have increased decreased approximately million  if interest rates increased decreased basis points
