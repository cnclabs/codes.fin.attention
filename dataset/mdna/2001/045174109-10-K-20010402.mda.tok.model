revenues associated with our web properties group include all revenue streams generated from the web sites we own and operate  as well as from the syndication of services offered on our sites to other companies sites 
these revenues consist primarily of four components advertising revenues  syndication fees  ecommerce lead generation revenues  and targeting and acquisition revenues 
a significant portion of the company s advertising revenues are derived from the sale of promotional space on the company s online internet properties 
services offered range from short term banner advertisements and sponsorships to long term arrangements which may include the development of co branded  integrated websites 
revenue derived from such arrangements is recognized during the period which the service is provided  provided that no significant obligations remain at the end of the period 
company obligations typically include the guarantee of a minimum number of impressions or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the company s online properties 
to the extent the minimum guaranteed impressions are not delivered  the company defers recognition of the corresponding revenue until the remaining guaranteed impressions levels are achieved 
syndication fees consist of either a fixed fee that is recognized ratably over the contractual term  generally a twelve month period or a revenue sharing arrangement 
revenues from electronic commerce are generated when a user clicks on the answer that links to an electronic commerce merchant s web site on a cost per click  or cpc basis 
electronic commerce transaction fees are derived from short term electronic commerce merchant contracts  generally over a three to six month period

other income includes interest income on our cash and investments  partially offset by interest due on our financing obligations 
stock based compensation reflects the amortization of stock compensation charges from employee stock options 
deferred compensation charges arise from the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of specific stock options granted to our employees and are amortized over the vesting period 
the company has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of various purchase acquisitions made 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets is amortized ratably over the estimated economic lives of the respective assets  generally three to five years 
write off of in process technology relates to costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions 
we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have been funded primarily through the issuance of preferred and common equity securities  including our initial public offering in july and follow on public offering in march we believe that we will incur negative cash flows from operations in the future 
although we are targeting positive cash flows from operations by the third quarter of  because of the rapid and unexpectedly sharp deterioration of the general business climate in recent months  we cannot predict when we will achieve either positive cash flows from operations or financial reporting profitability in the future 
there was no provision for federal or state income taxes for any period since inception due to our operating losses 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a foreign income tax provision of million related to taxes withheld from customer payments and remitted to foreign taxing jurisdictions on the company s behalf 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million expiring in the year utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
a valuation allowance has been established and  accordingly  no benefit has been recognized for our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  we believe that  based on a number of factors  the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
these factors include our history of net losses since inception and expected near term future losses 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and forecasted operating results

we intend to continue to pursue a brand enhancement strategy  which will include mass market and multimedia advertising  promotional programs and public relations activities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses is attributed to an increase in the number of general and administrative personnel  recruiting costs associated with filling key executive positions and investments in infrastructure as well as increased accounting and legal costs incurred in connection with business activities 
stock based compensation for the years ended december  and  we recorded and million  respectively  in amortization of deferred stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants

restructuring costs in response to new challenges in the business environment  in december  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring program aimed at streamlining its underlying cost structure to better position the company for growth and improved operating results 
as part of the restructuring program  the company implemented a reduction in force of approximately positions 
the reductions came from all areas of the company and  as of december   the majority of these terminations were completed 
as part of the restructuring  the company determined that the operations of the evergreen project  inc  which was acquired in january  no longer fit the company s strategic objectives and were terminated

as a result of the restructuring program  the company s annual expense base was reduced by approximately million as compared with previous expectations 
the majority of the cost savings are expected to be realized as a result of lower headcount  reduced facility costs and terminated marketing programs 
over time  these cost savings are expected to be partially offset by increased operating expenses to support future revenue growth 
while we believe that our business realignment will assist us in streamlining operations  increasing revenues  reducing expenses and thereby achieving profitability  we cannot assure you that we will achieve these anticipated results 
we may in the future be required to take additional actions  including further changes to the business organization  in order to realign the business with anticipated requirements 
if we are not successful in realigning our business to increase revenues and decrease costs  we may never achieve profitability

in june  the fasb issued fas which significantly amends fas fas  as amended  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company will be required to adopt fas effective january  management of the company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab 
sab  as amended  summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying accounting principles generally accepted to revenue recognition and classification in financial statements 
the company adopted sab in the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on its revenues or results of operations

fin is generally effective  and to be applied prospectively  to all new awards  modifications to outstanding awards and changes in employee status on or after july  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in operating results our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that may adversely affect our results of operations include o our ability to obtain new corporate customers  the length of the development cycle for corporate customers and consequently  the timing of revenue recognition with respect to contracts with corporate customers  o our ability to obtain new advertising contracts  maintain existing ones  and effectively manage our advertising inventory  o the number of questions asked and answered on ask 
com  ajkids 
com and directhit 
com and on the web sites of our corporate customers  o our ability to attract and retain advertisers and our ability to link our electronic commerce partners to potential customers  o rate changes for advertising on ask 
com  ajkids 
com and directhit 
com  and o marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs as well as other costs that we may incur as we expand our operations 
o seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for our electronic commerce services and for advertising space on ask 
com  ajkids 
com and directhit 
com  o our ability to develop and introduce new technology  o announcements and new technology introductions by our competitors  o our ability to attract and retain key personnel  o costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of technologies or businesses  because of the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
as internet advertising makes the transition from an emerging to a more developed market  seasonal and cyclical patterns may develop in our industry that may also affect our revenues 
similar to traditional media  this may result in our advertising sales being lower during summer vacation and year end holiday periods 
seasonality in the retail industry and in internet service usage is likely to cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and could harm our business 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the private placement of equity securities  our initial public offering and our follow on offering 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and marketable securities 
marketable securities consist of highly liquid instruments primarily us  state and municipal government securities and corporate debt securities with short maturities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from net losses adjusted for non cash operating activities such as depreciation and amortization and increases in deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   related to purchases of investments of and property and equipment of million  partially offset by redemptions of investments of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing was due primarily to purchases of property and equipment of million and purchases of million of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities primarily related to net proceeds of million from the sale of common equity securities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided from financing activities related primarily to net proceeds of million from the sale of common and million from the sale of preferred equity securities  million of net proceeds from our initial public offering  and million of proceeds from capital lease financings 
we have no material commitments or obligations other than those under capital and operating leases 
the company has available a revolving line of credit with a bank in the amount of million 
the line of credit expires on july   unless extended 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by the company libor plus or the bank s prime rate 
all borrowings are collateralized by the company s marketable securities 
borrowings under the line are subject to various covenants 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our services and the amount of resources we invest in site and content development  marketing and selling our services  our brand promotions and any future acquisitions or divestitures 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our expenditures since our inception consistent with growth in our operations and staffing 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
at the end of such period  we will need to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures  or we will need to raise additional capital 
however  if during that twelve month period or thereafter  we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  these failures could seriously harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates and marketable equity security prices  relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on our investment securities because a substantial majority of our investments are in fixed rate  short term securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the fixed rate  short term nature of the substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
all of our accounts and transactions are denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to foreign exchange fluctuation exposures
