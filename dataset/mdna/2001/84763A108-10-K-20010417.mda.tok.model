item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the financial statements and the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview from our inception in june through december   we have devoted our resources primarily to fund research and development  and incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
during this period  we had only limited revenues from grants  and had no revenues from the sale of products or other sources 
we expect our operating expenses to decrease in the immediate future  but to increase over the next several years as we expand our research and development and commercialization activities and operations 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for at least the next several years unless such operating losses are offset  if at all  by licensing revenues under strategic alliances with larger pharmaceutical companies  which we are currently seeking 
through december   the operations of our neogene and neooncorx subsidiary corporations were not material and  accordingly  no segment information is presented herein 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had no revenues for the twelve month periods ended december  or research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased by approximately million or over the previous year 
this increase was due primarily to the costs and the expenses associated with the conduct of clinical and preclinical trials as we accelerated our program to commercialize our lead product candidate  neotrofin tm 
these costs and expenses were due primarily to the increased number and length of our clinical trials and manufacturing and formulation of drug compound  all of which were conducted by outside organizations 
internally  research and development expenses increased in the categories of salaries due to additional personnel  salary increases and related benefits 
in november  we terminated our contract with an outside clinical research organization and cancelled a major international clinical trial for alzheimer s disease involving over  patients 
the decision to cancel this trial was based on indeterminate efficacy at the same and lower doses in patients who participated in several other trials which were completed during  and the positive results shown in a higher dose trial with a limited group of alzheimer s patients 
in march and april  we began new phase clinical trials of neotrofin tm in alzheimer s disease and other indications at higher dose levels than administered in the previous trials 
these new trials will be managed internally and we have increased the number of our employees and consultants for that purpose 
in the immediate future we expect our research and development costs to decrease due to the net savings expected from internally managing our clinical trial program  as compared to the higher cost of using an outside clinical research organization 
thereafter  we expect that such expenses will again increase as we expand our clinical trials on neotrofin tm and other drug candidates  as well as our research activities at our neogene subsidiary 
depending on the results of our planned clinical trials for neotrofin tm and the outcome of the regulatory approval process  we will expand our manufacturing capabilities as we approach commercialization of our lead product  neotrofin tm 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or over the previous year 
this increase is due primarily to increases in personnel  salary increases and related benefits  recruiting  relocation  travel  and depreciation and amortization 
interest income increased by million  or in over as a result of the full year utilization of invested funds 
we expect interest earnings to decrease over the next year due to our use of the funds in current operations 
interest expense increased by million  or in over  due principally to a non cash interest charge related to amortization of discount and debt issuance costs of our convertible debentures 
these securities were issued and converted into common stock during we expect the above mentioned general and administrative expenses to increase in the immediate future due to expected increases in administrative support and sales and marketing activities associated with our change in strategy and continued focus on bringing one or more of our products to market 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had no revenues for the twelve month periods ended december  or research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased by approximately million  or over the previous year 
this increase was due primarily to the costs and expenses associated with the conduct of clinical and preclinical trials as we accelerated our program to commercialize our lead compound  neotrofin tm 
these costs and expenses were due primarily to the increased number and length of our clinical trials and manufacturing and formulation of drug compound  all of which were conducted by outside organizations 
internally  research and development expenses increased in the categories of salaries due to additional personnel and salary increases  research grants  professional fees due to increased patent activity  rent due principally to the re allocation from general and administrative expense as a result of research and development utilizing a higher proportion of our facility and depreciation of property and equipment 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december   over the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for reflect increased expenses related to increases in salaries due principally to added personnel  investor relations  regulatory agency fees and licenses and printing  offset by the re allocation of rent to research and development 
in the company entered into a non recurring  non cash settlement of a matter of litigation and recorded a charge to general and administrative expense of  year ended december   compared to year ended december  we had no revenues for the twelve month periods ended december  or research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december   increased by approximately million  or over the previous year 
this increase was due primarily to the costs and expenses associated with the conduct of clinical and preclinical trials as we accelerated our program to commercialize our lead compound  neotrofin tm 
these costs and expenses were primarily in the categories of salaries due to additional personnel  rent  contract manufacturing and formulation of drug compounds  outside preclinical testing and the increased number and length of clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  for the year ended december   over the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for reflect increased expenses related to additional personnel  insurance  professional and consulting fees  commissions  facilities rent and travel 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in future periods due to expected increases in both research and development support and sales and marketing activities associated with attempting to bring one or more of our products to market 
interest income decreased by approximately million  or  in over due to increased use of cash to fund current operations 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we financed our operations primarily through sales of securities  borrowings  grants and deferred payment of salaries and other expenses from related parties

on january   the first vested period ended which resulted under the reset formula in the issuance of  shares of our common stock to the investors 
on march   an additional  shares of our common stock was owed to the investors under the second and final reset under the agreement

under the provisions of the agreement  neogene issued and sold to the investor a total of  shares of its series b convertible preferred stock  at a purchase price of per share  and issued a five year warrant to purchase a total of  shares of neogene common stock  at an exercise price of per share

at december   we had working capital of approximately million which included cash and equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we had working capital of approximately million which included cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
the million increase in working capital is attributable primarily to the net proceeds of equity transactions entered into during  aggregating approximately million  less the funding of the million operating loss for the year ended december   equipment purchases of million and repayment of debt principal of million 
in  we intend to spend approximately million for additional equipment  including equipment for our new genomics based subsidiary  as we further expand our research and development laboratories 
we expect to partially finance these capital equipment acquisitions by utilizing our existing capital lease 
during march we entered into a number of agreements  which are cancelable at any time with written notice  with approximately different clinical sites in the united states to conduct a patient alzheimer s clinical trial which began in april we expect to spend approximately million towards this clinical trial over the course of approximately one year 
in addition  in march  we began smaller scale clinical trials in spinal cord injury and parkinson s disease 
the cost of these trials will aggregate approximately million over a one year period from their commencement date 
the above trials will be managed internally and are estimated to cost an aggregate of approximately million over an eighteen month period 
since our inception  we have been in the development stage and therefore devote substantially all of our efforts to research and development 
we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately million through december   and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
we received million in new funding in february and march in april  we entered into an agreement with two private investor groups to provide equity and financing  aggregating approximately million over approximately a one year period 
our future capital requirements and availability of capital will depend upon many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  the cost of commercialization activities and other factors which may not be within our control 
assuming that the aforementioned additional funding is available  we believe that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our capital needs for at least months of operations 
we also believe that  if these funds are not available  we may be required to scale back or possibly cancel certain clinical trial activities or obtain additional financing elsewhere 
ultimately  we will require substantial additional funds in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our proposed products 
if we are successful in obtaining additional equity funding  our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution to their shares of stock 
without additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development projects  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others which may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize on our own  and which could be on terms unfavorable to us 
our principal research and administrative facilities are located in the state of california which is currently experiencing an energy crisis 
the continuation of this crisis could seriously disrupt or impair our ability to operate due to shortages of heat and power and or the escalation of our operating costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities and borrowing arrangements 
all investments in marketable securities and borrowing arrangements are entered into for purposes other than trading 
we are not subject to material risks from currency rate fluctuations  nor do we utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from financial instruments entered into in the normal course of business 
certain of our financial instruments are fixed rate  short term investments in government and corporate notes and bonds  which are available for sale and have been marked to market in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of these investments  however  because these financial instruments are considered available for sale  all such changes are reflected in the financial statements in the period affected 
our borrowings bear interest at fixed annual rates 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of such debt  but do not have an impact on earnings or cash flows 
because of the relatively short term nature of our borrowings  fluctuations in fair value are not deemed to be material 
qualitative disclosures our primary exposures relate to interest rate risk on borrowings  our ability to pay or refinance our borrowings at maturity at market rates  interest rate risk on the value of our investment portfolio and rate of return  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future cash requirements 
we manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with our cash requirements 
we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding borrowings by using fixed rate debt 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing borrowings and investment portfolio  we evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
