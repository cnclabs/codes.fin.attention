for  the increase in system and software revenue was primarily due to increased software product sales and to a lesser extent  increased accelerated verification systems sales 
the growth in software product revenues in was primarily attributable to strength in the physical verification and analysis product line and the acquisition of veribest  inc veribest in the fourth quarter of accelerated verification systems realized strong demand in japan 
the company s accelerated verification products are not available in us markets 
see part i item legal proceedings for further discussion 
for  these increases occurred despite weakening of the european currencies versus the us dollar which negatively impacted revenues 
see geographic revenues information for further discussion 
for  the increase in system and software revenue was attributable to increased accelerated verification systems sales and to a lesser extent  increased software product sales 
accelerated verification systems were available for the entire year and realized continued market acceptance and demand in europe and japan 
the growth in software product revenues in was primarily attributable to growth of the company s newer product offerings  offset in part by a decline in sales of its older products during the year 
in addition  software revenues were favorably affected by the acquisition of veribest on october  for which no revenues were reported prior to the acquisition date 
system and software gross margins were higher for compared to due to greater software revenue and improved margins on accelerated verification system sales 
system and software gross margins were approximately flat in compared to  as there were no significant increased costs such as technology amortization or third party royalties 
amortization of purchased technology costs to system and software cost of revenues was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of veribest in the fourth quarter of and the five acquisitions in the decline in amortization in was attributable to a significant decline in business acquisitions in and purchased technology costs are amortized over three to five years to system and software cost of revenues 
service and support service and support revenues consist of revenues from annual support contracts and professional services  which includes consulting services  training services  custom design services and other services 
for compared to  the increase was due primarily to a increase in software support revenue 
for compared to  software support was approximately flat while professional service revenues increased slightly 
for  growth in software support revenues was attributable to the acquisition of veribest  continued success of software product offerings and a resultant larger installed base of customers 
for  the flattening of software support revenues was due in part to pricing pressures in the eda industry and lower growth of software product sales 
since growth in software support is affected by continued success of the software product offerings  increases in the company s installed customer base  and the impact of acquisitions  future software support revenue levels are difficult to predict 
professional service revenues totaled approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to higher utilization of global consulting personnel 
the flattening of revenues in was due to a strategy to increase focus on engagements that help customers better utilize the company s products and substantially decrease focus on custom design service engagements 
service and support gross margins increased in as a result of higher revenue over a relatively consistent cost structure and improved professional service utilization 
service and support gross margins increased in as a result of improved professional service gross margins  due in part to the cost structure improvements associated with the strategic changes previously discussed 
geographic revenues information americas revenues including service and support revenues  increased from to and decreased from to revenues outside the americas represented of total revenues in  of revenues in and of revenues in european revenues increased from to and from to increased international revenues in were attributable to growth of demand in europe

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was   and in  and  respectively 
the net tax provision in all periods is the result of the mix of profits earned by the company and its subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due to the impact of nondeductible charges mostly related to acquisitions offset by the realized benefit of net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and earnings permanently reinvested in offshore operations 
net undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered permanently reinvested amounted to approximately  at december  accordingly  no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon

average days sales outstanding in total accounts receivable increased from days at the end of to days at the end of this increase in average trade receivable days sales outstanding was primarily attributable to fewer sales of accounts receivable 
the company sold short term accounts receivable of  and  to a financing institution on a non recourse basis in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
prepaid expenses and other prepaid expenses and other increased  from december  to december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in prepaid commissions as a result of higher backlog 
in addition  the accelerated verification systems inventory balance increased by  due to timing of shipments 
term receivables  long term term receivables  long term increased to  at december  compared to  at december  the balances were attributable to demand for multi year  multi element term license sales agreements principally from the company s top rated credit customers

the company uses term agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
the increase was primarily attributable to ongoing demand for agreements of this nature 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of prepaid annual software support contracts

factors that may affect future results and financial condition the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  and words of similar import  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
moreover  from time to time the company may issue other forward looking statements 
forward looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
the following discussion highlights factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the company s forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
the company competes in the highly competitive and dynamic eda industry 
the company s success is dependent upon its ability to develop and market products and selling models that are innovative  cost competitive and meet customer expectations 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can create adverse effects including  but not limited to  price reductions  lower product margins  loss of market share and additional working capital requirements 
additionally  newer pricing and selling models in the industry  including the use of fixed term licenses and subscription transactions versus traditional perpetual licenses further complicate the company s ability to effectively price and package large multi element contracts that are competitive and profitable 
the company s business is largely dependent upon the success and growth of the electronics industry 
from time to time the electronics industry cuts costs through employee layoffs and reductions in the number of electronic design projects which could reduce demand for the company s products and services 
several of the companies largest customers have recently announced lower revenue and profit expectations for the coming year 
such projections may result in lower r d spending which may include lower capital expenditures for eda software and consulting services 
in addition  there have been a number of mergers in the electronics industry worldwide  which could result in decreased or delayed capital spending patterns 
the above business challenges for the electronics and related industries may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a material amount of the company s software product revenue is usually the result of current quarter order performance of which a substantial amount is usually booked in the last few weeks of each quarter 
in addition  the company s revenue often includes multi million dollar contracts 
the timing of the completion of these contracts and the terms of delivery of software  hardware and other services can have a material impact on revenue recognition for a given quarter 
the combination of these factors impairs and delays the company s ability to identify shortfalls or overages from quarterly revenue targets 
the company s revenue is affected by the mix of licenses entered into in connection with the sale of software products 
the company s software licenses fall into three categories perpetual  fixed term  and subscription 
with perpetual and fixed term licenses  software product revenue is recognized at the beginning of the license period  while with subscription licenses  software product revenue is recognized ratably over the license period 
accordingly  a shift in the license mix toward increased subscription licenses would result in increased deferral of software product revenue to future periods 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition have been subject to recent authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software product revenue up front  focusing on contractual terms that distinguish fixed term licenses from subscription licenses 
the company s ability to meet revenue projections could be adversely affected by new and revised standards and interpretations of accounting rules governing revenue recognition 
the company generally realizes approximately half of its revenues outside the us and expects this to continue in the future 
as such  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations can impact the company s business and operating results 
to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts 
however  significant changes in exchange rates may have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
international operations subject the company to other risks including  but not limited to  longer receivables collection periods  economic or political instability  government trade restrictions  limitations on repatriation of earnings  licensing and intellectual property rights protection 
the company s meta division is in the hardware development and assembly business 
risk factors include procuring hardware components on a timely basis from a limited number of suppliers  assembling and shipping systems on a timely basis with appropriate quality control  developing distribution and shipment processes  managing inventory and related obsolescence issues  and developing processes to deliver customer support for hardware 
in addition  the company is engaged in litigation with quickturn  a subsidiary of cadence design systems  inc  in which quickturn has asserted that the company and meta are infringing quickturn patents 
see part i item legal proceedings for further discussion 
the company has been prohibited from using  selling or marketing its simexpress emulation products in the united states 
while the company settled one simexpress court case in the second quarter of  other legal proceedings and litigation continue 
these actions could adversely effect the company s ability to sell its accelerated verification products in other jurisdictions worldwide and may negatively affect demand for accelerated verification products for the company worldwide until the outcome is determined 
this litigation could result in lower sales of accelerated verification products  increase the risk of inventory obsolescence and have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s gross margin may vary as a result of mix of products and services sold 
the gross margin on software products is greater than that for hardware products  software support and professional services 
additionally  the margin on software products will vary quarter to quarter depending on the amount of third party royalties due for the mix of products sold 
achievement of projected gross margins is also dependent on revenue performance since the company s cost of revenues includes certain fixed or relatively fixed costs such as professional service employee costs and purchased technology amortization 
the company uses term or installment sales agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
these multi year  multi element term license and perpetual license term agreements are from the company s top rated credit customers and are typically three years in length 
these agreements may increase the element of risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product satisfaction or disagreements and disputes 
if collectibility for any of these multi million dollar agreements becomes a problem the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s operating expenses are generally committed in advance of revenue and are based to a large degree on future revenue expectations 
operating expenses are incurred to generate and sustain higher future revenue levels 
if the revenue does not materialize as expected  the company s results of operations can be adversely impacted 
acquisitions of complementary businesses are a part of the company s overall business strategy 
challenges associated with this strategy include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  retention of key employees  integration of systems of internal controls  and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors can impair the company s ability to forecast  to meet quarterly revenue and earnings targets and to effectively manage the business for long term growth 
there can be no assurance that these challenges will be effectively met 
the company has been able to recruit and retain necessary personnel to research and develop  market  sell and service products that satisfy customers needs 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
in particular  qualified technology personnel are in high demand  and competition to recruit and retain them is intense 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  new or revised accounting standards and interpretations of standards are issued from time to time which could have a material impact on the reported financial results 
forecasts of the company s income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty as the company s income tax position for each year combines the effects of available tax benefits in certain countries where the company does business and benefits from available net operating loss carryforwards 
in order to forecast the company s global tax rate  pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated 
if the mix of profits and losses or effective tax rates by jurisdiction are different than those estimates  the company s actual tax rate could be materially different than forecast 
the company is involved in various administrative matters and litigation 
there can be no assurance that they will not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in particular  as patents have become increasingly significant in the eda industry  the company is exposed to increased risk of involvement in very costly and time consuming patent infringement litigation  either as plaintiff or defendant 
for example  see part i item legal proceedings 
the pending litigation and any future litigation may result in substantial unanticipated legal costs and divert the efforts of management personnel 
due to the factors above  as well as other market factors outside the company s control  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indication of future performance 
the investment community should use caution in using historical trends to estimate future results 
in addition  if future results vary significantly from expectations of analysts  the company s stock price could be adversely impacted

to hedge its foreign currency against highly anticipated sales transactions  the company also purchases foreign exchange options which permit but do not require foreign currency exchanges at a future date with another party at a contracted exchange price 
remeasurement gains and losses on forward and option contracts are deferred and recognized when the sale occurs 
all subsequent remeasurement gains and losses are recognized as they occur to offset remeasurement gains and losses recognized on the related foreign currency accounts receivable balances 
these contracts generally have maturities which do not exceed twelve months 
the difference between the recorded value and the fair value of the company s foreign exchange position related to these contracts was approximately zero at december  and december  the fair value of these contracts was calculated based on dealer quotes 
the company entered into a forward contract to stabilize the currency effects on a portion of the company s net investment in its japanese subsidiary 
this contract to sell million japanese yen would guarantee the company  at the contact s expiration 
any differences between the contracted currency rate and the currency rate at each balance sheet date will impact the foreign currency translation adjustment component of stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
the result is a partial offset of the effect of japanese currency changes on stockholders equity during the contract term 
this forward contact should not impact current or future consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the difference between the recorded value and the fair value of the company s foreign exchange position related to this contract was approximately zero 
the company does not anticipate non performance by the counter parties to these contracts 
looking forward  the company does not expect any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately
