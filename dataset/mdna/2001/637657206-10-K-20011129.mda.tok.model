fiscal operating profit was million compared to last year s operating profit of million 
higher employee medical and casualty insurance costs  increased labor and energy costs  a sales tax audit assessment  and severance and restructuring costs  partially offset by a gain related to a reduction in the segment s environmental liabilities  were primarily responsible for the decrease in fiscal operating profit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures about market risk the company believes that its exposure to market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  and consolidated statements of cash flows primarily relate to changing interest rates and commodity prices 
the company does not enter into derivative arrangements for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates the company s credit line and fixed rate notes are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
these fluctuations expose the company to changes in interest expense  cash flows  and the fair market value of the instruments 
the company s variable rate debt amounted to million at august  based on outstanding borrowings at year end  a percent adverse change in effective market interest rates at august  would result in an immaterial amount of additional interest expense 
commodity price risk from time to time  the company s textile rental segment enters into arrangements locking in for specified periods the prices the company will pay for the volume of natural gas to which the contract relates 
the contracts are structured to reduce the segment s exposure to changes in the price of natural gas 
however  these contracts also limit the benefit the segment might have otherwise received from decreases in the price of natural gas 
the company does not believe a percent adverse change in market rates of natural gas would have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income
