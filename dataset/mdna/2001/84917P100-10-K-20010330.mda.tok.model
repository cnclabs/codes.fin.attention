operating results can be affected by a number of circumstances the nature and effect of which cannot be predicted 
our revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  an increase of million or 
revenue increased primarily due to increases in membership dues and ancilliary services fees and the final maturation of the membership base at the reebok sports club ny

operating expenses increased primarily due to additional direct expenses associated with the increased revenues  increased general and administrative expenses and the recognition of pre opening costs 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to legal expenses associated with litigation and the increase in corporate infrastructure related to our planned expansion 
pre opening expenses incurred in were million 
effective january   we adopted sop which provides that all costs related to the development of new fitness clubs  except for real estate related costs  be expensed as incurred 
this is a change from our previous accounting policy  whereby many of these costs were capitalized and charged to expense upon the clubs opening 
other expenses for the year ended december   were million  compared to other income of million for the change in other income and expense is primarily due to increased interest expense associated with our million senior secured notes issued in april our pro forma net income for the year ended december  was million  or per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of million in  or per basic and diluted share 
in  we incurred a charge from a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of applicable taxes  of  this charge is associated with the write off of pre opening expenses incurred and capitalized prior to january  in  we incurred a loss from early extinguishment of debt  net of applicable taxes of million  which was recorded as an extraordinary charge 
liquidity and capital resources cash and credit availability 
on april   we issued in a private placement million of senior secured notes due in march the senior secured notes  with interest due semi annually 
we used million of the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness 
the balance is being used to develop new clubs and for general corporate purposes 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture dated april  the indenture entered into in connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes  there is currently million segregated into a disbursement escrow account which is specifically restricted to funding the development of new clubs 
the senior secured notes are secured by substantially all of our assets  other than certain excluded assets 
the indenture includes certain covenants which as of december   restrict our ability to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay dividends or other distributions  or repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  and iii make certain investments 
the indenture also limits our ability to i enter into transactions with affiliates  ii create liens or sell certain assets  and iii enter into mergers and consolidations 
our bank credit facility provides us million of financing with a maturity date of may  advances under our credit facility bear interest at a variable rate of libor plus or the bank s prime rate 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility but million was utilized in the form of letters of credit  leaving million available for future borrowings 
under the terms of the indenture  we are currently allowed to increase our existing bank facility by million and to incur an additional million in equipment financing obligations 
at december  we did not meet certain financial covenants required by the credit agreement 
the bank has waived these defaults 
we are currently reviewing the loan covenants in connection with the annual renewal of the credit facility 
on december   our balance of cash  including restricted cash  was million 
of this amount  million has been segregated into a disbursement escrow account and is specifically restricted to funding the development of new clubs 
we currently own real estate in houston  texas 
the houston property was acquired in with intentions of building the sports club la houston on the site 
we have decided to sell the houston property 
the carrying value of this property is million as of december  operating cash flow 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for operating activities 
this included the payment of our semi annual interest under the senior secured notes that aggregated million and million for the payment of pre opening expenses at several the sports club la locations 
all our mature sports clubs are profitable and generate positive cash flow from operations 
newly developed clubs tend to achieve significant increases in revenues until a mature membership level is reached 
in the past  recently opened clubs that have not yet achieved mature membership levels have operated at a loss or at only a slight profit as a result of fixed expenses that  together with variable operating expenses  approximate or exceed membership fees and other revenue 
we expect this trend to continue at the five clubs we have opened or will open in and our ability to generate positive cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon increasing membership levels at our new clubs 
new club development 
in we completed construction of the sports club la at three new sites  which opened in february  september and october of as of december   approximately million of construction and equipment costs remain unpaid on these developments 
in connection with our acquisition of the rights to develop the sports club la in manhattan s upper east side  we issued a note for million to the seller 
the note required two equal principal payments in april and april we have not made these payments because we believe that we have various claims against the seller relating to the purchase of the property  which offset the money owed on the note  and we are currently in litigation regarding this matter see note  commitments and contingencies  to consolidated financial statements 
we have entered into lease agreements with millennium entertainment partners and or its affiliates collectively millennium with respect to the development of the sports club la in san francisco and boston 
in march  we amended those leases to provide for additional landlord contributions of million towards the construction of these facilities  and a million general landlord contribution 
millennium owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
millennium began construction on each of these projects in our portion of the remaining aggregate development costs for these clubs is currently estimated to be approximately million 
equipping these clubs will require an additional million 
the sports club la in boston and san francisco are expected to open in the third quarter of excess proceeds offer 
our net proceeds from the sale of the spectrum clubs were approximately million 
to the extent the net proceeds were not reinvested in assets related to our business before december   the indenture requires us to make an excess proceeds offer and apply the unused net proceeds to retire senior secured notes  unless the remaining net proceeds are less than million 
at december   the remaining excess proceeds were below the million threshold and therefore no excess proceeds offer under the indenture is required or will be made 
future capital requirements 
in addition to the development projects described above  we incur capital expenditures for normal replacement of fitness equipment and remodeling of clubs 
equipment financing and operating cash flow have historically funded these expenditures 
while capital expenditures may fluctuate from time to time  we generally expect to spend approximately of revenues on facility and equipment upgrades and replacements 
we also expect to spend approximately million during the next months to upgrade our management information systems 
to fund anticipated operating losses and complete the development projects under construction  we expect to use our cash and short term investment balances  available equipment financing and a portion of our bank credit facility 
however  if costs at our clubs under development exceed our construction budgets  operating losses exceed current estimates  membership levels at newly opened clubs do not increase as projected  we are unable to renew our bank credit facility or are able to renew it but on terms and conditions less favorable to us than presently exist  or there are other adverse developments  we may be required to sell assets  restructure or limit our current development plans and or raise additional funds 
further  there is no assurance that we will be able to renew our current bank arrangement with acceptable terms 
we anticipate that increased cash flows from recently opened clubs and clubs under development  along with cash flows from our mature clubs  will in the future enable us to fund our continuing operations 
additional funds will be required to undertake any future acquisitions or the development of more new clubs 
the indenture agreement currently prohibits us from incurring any additional indebtedness other than the amounts permitted under our bank credit agreement and equipment financing limits 
we may seek to raise funds through an offering of equity securities  asset sales or other means subject to the restrictions in the indenture 
we may also consider entering into joint venture or partnership agreements subject to the restrictions of the indenture for the purpose of developing new clubs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds through an equity offering or other transaction  or that restructuring or limiting our current development plans would not have a material adverse effect on us
