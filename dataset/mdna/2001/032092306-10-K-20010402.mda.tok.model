in february  in order to focus more sharply on its internet video businesses  the company announced plans to sell data systems  its subsidiary which makes high performance tape based mass data storage products 
the company continues to operate data systems as it had in the past 
however  for accounting purposes  the results of operations of data systems have been classified as a business held for sale in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
the book value of the net assets to be sold of this segment have been reflected in net assets of business held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and upon consummation of a successful sale  the company intends to use the proceeds for investment in inextv and other internet initiatives  as well as to retire debt 
as of year end  ampex determined to discontinue the operations of micronet  its subsidiary which manufactures disk arrays and storage area network products 
at december   the company established a reserve for the costs of closure and to write off its investment in micronet 
accordingly  the operations of micronet have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

royalty income 
royalty income was million in  million in and million in royalty income in were positively impacted by royalty income of approximately million  representing the portion of royalties earned through from a long term license agreement extending through the year the company s royalty income derives from patent licenses  and the company receives most of its royalty income from licenses with companies that manufacture consumer video products such as vcrs and camcorders and  in certain cases  professional video tape recorders 
during this period  a growing portion of royalty income related to mm and mm video recorders and camcorders 
the company is assessing whether manufacturers of video games  dvd recorders and digital television receivers are using its patented technology 
there can be no assurance that the manufacturers of these products are utilizing the company s technology or  if used  whether the company will be able to negotiate license agreements with the manufacturers 
royalty income has historically fluctuated widely due to a number of factors that the company cannot predict or control such as the extent of use of the company s patented technology by third parties  the materiality of any nonrecurring royalties received as the result of negotiated settlements for products sold by manufacturers prior to entering into licensing agreements with the company  the extent which the company must pursue litigation in order to enforce its patents  and the ultimate success of its licensing and litigation activities 
the costs of patent litigation can be material  and the institution of patent enforcement litigation may also increase the risk of counterclaims alleging infringement by the company of patents held by third parties or seeking to invalidate patents held by the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries were less than of total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to the company s foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in and was not material 
investment risk 
the company invests in equity instruments of technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than and the company does not have significant influence over the business operations 
the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the company identifies and records impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
investments  which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market
