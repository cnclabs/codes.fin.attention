restaurants open at end of year weighted average weekly sales per restaurant    net sales net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in the million of sales recorded in represents an increase of million  or  over million of sales reported in these increases were due to the opening of new restaurants and to increases of in weighted average weekly sales per restaurant in and in fiscal contained weeks of operations compared to weeks for both and same store sales  which include comparable results for all restaurants open for more than months  increased to  per week in on a base of restaurants 
same store sales for averaged  per week  on a base of restaurants  representing an increase of over management estimates the average check per guest  excluding alcoholic beverage sales  was for  representing an increase of approximately over menu prices for increased an estimated compared to management estimates that the average check per guest in totaled  representing a increase over menu prices for increased by an estimated compared to the company estimates that guest counts on a same store basis decreased by in and increased by approximately in near the end of the third quarter of  in order to increase sales and improve profitability  the company repositioned its menu to place more emphasis on its premium menu offerings and daily feature items  while de emphasizing certain lower priced menu items 
as a result of these changes and a number of other guest service improvement initiatives begun in  same store sales increased significantly  growing by in the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of as the year progressed  the growth in same store sales decreased on a comparative basis  with same store sales declining in the fourth quarter of guest counts were also down on a same store basis for the last three quarters of the guest count and sales declines were more significant in the company s small and mid market locations those with populations of less than million people  where same store sales for the year were flat as compared to a same store sales increase of in larger markets 
management believes that increases in check averages resulting from the menu changes made in late proved to be excessive for the size and economic characteristics of the small and mid market locations 
beginning in the fourth quarter of the company revised its menus and feature programs in certain of the restaurants in these markets in order to reduce guest check averages and improve guest count trends 
guest counts for the company were up slightly for the first two months of and while same store sales for that period remained down slightly  management currently anticipates that same store sales will increase in the last half of the year 
restaurant costs and expenses total restaurant operating expenses decreased to for from in and in  with restaurant operating margins increasing to in from in and in the largest factor contributing to the operating expense decreases in both and was the decrease in cost of sales resulting from management s continued emphasis on increased efficiencies in this area and the menu price increases noted above 
these improvements  combined with overall improvements in financial performance of the company s same store base of restaurants each year as the sales and efficiency of those restaurants has increased  more than offset the higher costs associated with the opening of new restaurants 
another factor contributing to the improvement in was the company s decision to change the estimated useful life of its buildings from to years and the estimated life of leasehold improvements to include an amortization period based on the lesser of the lease term  generally including renewal options  or the useful life of the asset 
the effect of these changes  which were implemented as of january   was to decrease restaurant operating expenses for by  or 
of sales 
management believes that continuing to increase sales volumes in the company s restaurants is a significant factor in continuing to improve the company s profitability 
beginning in  the company lowered its new restaurant development plans to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants while maintaining operational excellence 
also  in the company established criteria for its locations calling for higher population densities and higher household incomes than were met by certain of its previous locations 
the west bloomfield  michigan restaurant opened in late and the cincinnati  ohio restaurant opened in mid are the first restaurants to be opened under these more stringent criteria 
these restaurants posted average weekly sales of over  per week  which is significantly above the company s average sales volume for all restaurants  and combined restaurant operating income of approximately  for further  an indication of the importance of higher income levels to the success of j 
alexander s restaurants is that the company s restaurants located in markets with median household incomes of  or more averaged approximately  per week for  while restaurants located in markets with incomes below that level averaged approximately  per week 
management believes that the change in development criteria  together with continued emphasis on increasing sales and profits  particularly in its restaurants not located in higher income and or higher population density markets  will continue to have a positive impact on the company s sales and financial performance 
the company expects to experience increases in certain restaurant costs and expenses in these include particularly beef costs  utility costs and insurance and benefit costs 
management expects to offset these cost increases through a modest increase in menu prices and through cost control and reduction of other expenses 
to the extent sales are impacted as a result of menu price increases or for other reasons  these cost increases could make it difficult for the company to achieve significant  if any  improvement in operating margin 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include supervisory costs as well as management training costs and all other costs above the restaurant level  increased only slightly in fiscal compared to decreases in management training  relocation and procurement costs  which comprise approximately of total general and administrative expenses  and certain other employee benefit related expenses contributed to the modest increase in total general and administrative expenses for by partially offsetting increases in other expenses related to the growth of the company 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in due to the relatively small increase in expenditures and the higher sales levels achieved 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  in compared to as a percentage of sales these expenses increased to in from in these increases were due primarily to lower than normal general and administrative expenses in which resulted from favorable experience under both the company s workers compensation program and its self insured group medical insurance program which allowed the company to reduce its level of accruals and expense related to those programs for an increase in management training costs also contributed to higher general and administrative costs during general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for are expected to increase slightly as compared to pre opening expense because the company expenses all pre opening costs as incurred  pre opening expenses were lower in and  when only one restaurant was opened in each year  than in when two restaurants were opened 
other income and expense net interest expense increased only slightly in compared to interest expense decreased by  in compared to due primarily to reductions in the outstanding balance of the company s convertible subordinated debentures and a reduction in the company s line of credit resulting from applying proceeds from sales of stock in march and june   to the outstanding balance on the line 
other  net expense of  for and  for was the result of expenses associated with the write offs of facilities and equipment replaced in connection with various capital maintenance projects which more than offset miscellaneous income categories 
income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at december  and january   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at december  relate primarily to  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 
the recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the likelihood of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets must be reduced through use of a valuation allowance to the extent future income is not likely to be generated in such amounts 
due to the losses incurred in through and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of operating costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management has been unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets will be realized and has maintained a valuation allowance for of its net deferred tax assets since the valuation allowance related to the company s deferred tax assets totaled  and  at december  and january   respectively 
approximately  of future taxable income would be needed to realize the company s tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards at december  these carryforwards generally expire in the years through approximately  of taxable income would be needed to realize the carryforwards which expire in and  to use those which expire in the provision for income taxes for results from federal alternative minimum tax amt and state income taxes payable 
in  the company was able to reduce its amt liability by the use of amt net operating loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards were all utilized in  however  and were not available for liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for capital for the past three years has been for the development and maintenance of its j 
alexander s restaurants 
in addition  beginning in  the company has been required to meet an annual sinking fund requirement of  in connection with its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures 
the company has met its capital needs and maintained liquidity primarily by use of cash flow from operations  use of its bank line of credit and through other sources discussed below 
capital expenditures totaled   and  for  and  respectively  and were primarily for the development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
cash flow from operations exceeded capital expenditures in and also represented and of capital expenditures for and  respectively 
the remaining capital expenditures along with other needs for the and years were funded by use of the company s line of credit and  for  by the sale of common stock as discussed below 
in  the company plans to construct and open two restaurants  one of which will be on leased land with the other to be on purchased property 
management estimates that the cost to build these restaurants and for capital maintenance for existing restaurants will be approximately million for in addition  the company may incur capital expenditures for the purchase of property and or construction of restaurants for locations to be opened in any such expenditures are dependent upon the timing and success of management s efforts to locate acceptable sites and are not expected to exceed million 
while a working capital deficit of  existed as of december   the company does not believe this deficit impairs the overall financial condition of the company 
certain of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation and amortization  do not require current outlays of cash 
also  requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  thus virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
as of december   debentures in the principal amount of  had been purchased by the company for use toward satisfying the annual sinking fund requirement of  for this issue for in  the company s board of directors established a loan program designed to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
under the program participants were allowed to borrow an amount equal to the full price of common stock purchased 
the plan authorized million in loans to employees 
purchases of stock under the plan totaled  during  with the remainder purchased in the employee loans  which are reported as a deduction from stockholders equity  are payable on december   unless repaid sooner pursuant to terms of the plan 
the company maintains a bank line of credit of million which is expected to be used as needed for funding of capital expenditures and to provide liquidity for meeting working capital or other needs 
at december   borrowings outstanding under this line of credit were  in march of  the term of the line of credit was extended by one year through july  the amended line of credit agreement contains covenants which require the company to achieve specified results of operations and specified levels of senior debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and to maintain certain other financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  and  based on a current assessment of its business  believes it will continue to comply with these covenants through july  the credit agreement also contains certain limitations on capital expenditures and restaurant development by the company generally limiting the company to the development of two new restaurants per year and restricts the company s ability to incur additional debt outside the bank line of credit 
the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit is currently based on libor plus a spread of two to three percent  depending on the ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
the line of credit includes an option to convert outstanding borrowings to a term loan prior to july  in the event of such a conversion  the principal would be repaid in equal monthly installments 
because the line of credit is scheduled to mature within six months of december    representing six months principal payments if the total credit line balance were converted to a term loan  has been reflected as a current liability in the december  balance sheet 
management intends to seek an extension of the existing line of credit prior to its scheduled expiration on july   and believes that such an extension  or other suitable financing arrangement  will be available to meet the company s financing needs 
in march the company developed a plan for raising additional equity capital to further strengthen its financial position and  as part of this plan  completed a private sale of  shares of common stock to solidus  llc  an affiliate of one of the directors of the company  for approximately million 
in addition  on june   the company completed a rights offering wherein shareholders of the company purchased an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share  which was the same price per share as stock sold in the private sale 
the private sale and the rights offering raised total net proceeds to the company of approximately million which were used to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the company s bank line of credit 
the company believes that raising additional equity capital and repaying a portion of its outstanding debt benefited the company by reducing its debt to equity ratio and reducing interest expense and that it will provide greater flexibility to the company in providing for future financing needs 
impact of accounting changes there are no pending accounting pronouncements that  when adopted  are expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or its financial condition 
impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company is continually seeking ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions

actual results and experience could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see notes e and f to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources 
when the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly  the company may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use 
the company has purchase commitments for terms of one year or less for food and supplies with a variety of vendors 
such commitments generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the agreements 
the company has established long term relationships with key beef and seafood vendors and brokers 
adequate alternative sources of supply are believed to exist for substantially all products 
while the supply and availability of certain products can be volatile  the company believes that it has the ability to identify and access alternative products as well as the ability to adjust menu prices if needed 
significant items that could be subject to price fluctuations are beef  seafood  produce  pork and dairy products among others 
the company believes that any changes in commodity pricing which cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other product delivery strategies would not be material
