item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations our financial results for fiscal and fiscal reflect accounting for icsi and getsilicon on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of their respective operations 
our financial results for fiscal reflect accounting for e cmos on the equity basis and include our percentage gain or loss of their results of operations on a one quarter lag 
our financial results for fiscal through the period ended january  and for fiscal reflect accounting for nexflash on the equity basis and include our percentage share of the results of its operations 
effective february  our ownership of nexflash became less than  and we began accounting for nexflash on the cost basis 
prior to the quarter ended march   our ownership of icsi exceeded and our financial results were consolidated with those of icsi 
effective with the quarter ending march   we accounted for icsi on the equity basis and included in our financial statements our percentage share of icsi s financial results 
in fiscal  we accounted for nexflash on the equity basis and included in our financial statements our percentage share of nexflash s financial results 
at september   we owned approximately of icsi  approximately of nexflash  approximately of e cmos and approximately of getsilicon 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales was principally due to an increase in unit shipments  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price  of our megabit dram products  as well as increased unit shipments of certain sram products  specifically our k x  k x  k x  and k x sram products 
in addition  the average selling prices of our sram products generally increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will generally decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
in this regard  we experienced a significant decline in the average selling prices for certain of our products in the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended june  we anticipate a further decline in the average selling prices for certain of our products in the three months ended december  such declines may not be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
in this regard  we experienced a decrease in unit shipments for certain of our products in the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended june sales to flextronics international accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal substantially all of our sales to flextronics were for products to be delivered to cisco systems  inc shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal sales to com accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal shipments for com directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
however  in fiscal  shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net revenue 
as sales to these customers are executed pursuant to purchase orders and no purchasing contract exists  these customers can cease doing business with us at any time 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly costs and test costs  costs associated with in house product testing  quality assurance and import duties 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million  including million in the three months ended september  the inventory write downs were predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products  primarily drams and low power srams  and to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
excluding the inventory write downs in fiscal  gross profit for the period was million or of net sales 
excluding the inventory write downs in fiscal  the increase in gross profit dollars was principally due to an increase in unit shipments of our sram products  specifically our k x  k x  k x  and k x sram products 
in addition  increases in the average selling prices of our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal more than offset any increases in product costs resulting in higher gross margins 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal is due to a significant decline in the gross margin for dram products as a result of declining average selling prices 
we believe that the average selling price of our products will generally decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in this regard  we experienced a significant decline in the average selling prices for certain of our products in the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended june  we anticipate a further decline in the average selling prices for certain of our products in the three months ending december  in addition  product unit costs could increase if suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
although we have product cost reduction programs in place for certain products that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased expenses related to the development of new products and an increase in engineering personnel and payroll related expenses 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
during fiscal  our developments efforts were focused on ultra low power mb and mb srams  very high speed mb synchronous srams  mb asynchronous drams and mb high speed synchronous drams 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased payroll related expenses as a result of the addition  prior to the economic slow down  of marketing  sales and administrative personnel 
in addition  selling commissions increased as a result of higher revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in future quarters  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased interest income as a result of higher cash balances from the sale of investments and our follow on public stock offering in february gain on sale of investment 
the gain on sale of investment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in the three months ended december   we sold our interest in wafertech to tsmc for approximately million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
on january   icsi completed an initial public offering in taiwan 
as a result of shares of icsi sold by the company in the initial public offering and subsequently  we received gross proceeds of approximately million in fiscal resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in february  we  along with other shareholders  sold a portion of our ownership in nexflash to winbond international corporation for million resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
fiscal includes a pre tax gain of approximately million in the june quarter related to the sale of shares of icsi 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the tax provision for the year ended september  of  includes a benefit of approximately million for the reversal of taxes previously provided for foreign operations no longer deemed necessary as the statute has now expired and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits of approximately million reduced by a valuation allowance 
the tax provision for fiscal is primarily comprised of us federal income taxes 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
management has established a valuation allowance covering the net deferred tax assets based on management s belief that the realization of the deferred tax assets is not realizable on a more likely than not basis 
equity in net income of affiliated companies 
equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this primarily reflects a decrease in income from our percentage share of icsi s financial results in fiscal from fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  excluding the million in sales from icsi and the million in sales from nexflash in the december  quarter 
the increase in sales was principally due to an increase in unit shipments of our k  k  and k x sram products  as well as increased unit shipments of dram products  specifically our and megabit dram products 
in addition  the average selling prices of our sram and dram products generally increased in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
however  shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net revenue 
in fiscal  one customer  com  accounted for approximately of net sales 
net sales include licensing revenue of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net sales include sales of approximately million and million to icsi in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  net sales include sales of approximately million and million in sales to nexflash in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit was principally due to an increase in unit shipments of our k  k  and k x sram products  as well as increased unit shipments of dram products  specifically our and megabit dram products 
in addition  increases in the average selling prices of our sram and dram products in fiscal compared to fiscal more than offset any increases in product costs resulting in higher gross margins 
our gross profit also benefited from million and million of licensing revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily the result of a million reduction attributable to the deconsolidation of icsi and million attributable of the spin off of nexflash  offset by an increase in payroll related expenses and increased expenses related to the development of new products 
fiscal included a charge of million in the june quarter for the write off of certain acquired licensed products and technologies which have been replaced by our internally developed products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased selling commissions associated with higher revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal as well as payroll related expenses  offset by a million reduction attributable to the deconsolidation of icsi and million attributable to the spin off of nexflash 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase results primarily from an increase of million in interest income as a result of higher cash balances from our follow on public stock offering in february  offset by a decrease of million in other income attributable to the deconsolidation of icsi 
gain on sale of investment 
the gain on sale of investment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal includes a pre tax gain of approximately million in the june quarter related to the sale of an additional of our holdings in icsi 
fiscal includes a gain of approximately million in the june quarter related to the sale of our investment in uicc to umc  a pre tax gain of million resulting from the sale of of our holdings in icsi in the december quarter  offset by the loss of approximately million in the march quarter related to the sale of approximately of our investment in wafertech llc 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal is comprised of taxes on foreign earnings  foreign withholding taxes and us federal alternative minimum taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal is primarily based on foreign withholding taxes related to the sale of icsi stock and other foreign withholding taxes 
equity in net income of affiliated companies 
equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this primarily reflects an increase in income from our percentage share of icsi s financial results in fiscal from fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
during fiscal  operating activities used cash of approximately million compared to million in fiscal cash used by operations was primarily due to net income of million adjusted for the gain on sale of investments of million  depreciation of million  equity in net income of affiliated companies of million  other non cash items of million  and decreases in accounts payable of million  partially offset by decreases in inventories of million and accounts receivable of million 
in fiscal  we used million for investing activities compared to million in fiscal the cash used for investing activities in fiscal primarily resulted from net purchases of available for sale securities of million partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of our investment in wafertech to tsmc 
we also made an additional investment of million in smic 
we made other investments of million  including million for a interest in e cmos  a semiconductor company located in hsin chu  taiwan 
we generated million from the sale of shares of icsi stock and million from the sale of nexflash shares 
we received million in dividends from our equity investments 
the cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of net purchases of available for sale securities of million 
in addition  we used million for the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets  and made investments of million in smic  million in wafertech  million in nexflash  and other investments of million 
we generated million from the sale of shares of icsi stock 
in fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million for engineering tools and computer software 
we expect to spend approximately million to purchase capital equipment during the next twelve months  principally for the purchase of design and engineering tools  additional test equipment and computer software and hardware 
we generated million from financing activities during fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash generated from financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
the primary source of financing for fiscal was net proceeds from our follow on public stock offering in the march quarter of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal and fiscal  we sold some of our holdings in icsi to private investors 
in the three months ended december   we received million from the sale of shares of icsi under the issi taiwan stock plan 
on january   icsi completed an initial public offering in taiwan 
as a result of shares of icsi sold by the company in the initial public offering and subsequently  we received gross proceeds of approximately million in fiscal resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
as of september   we owned approximately of icsi 
in august  we entered into a wafer fabrication facility investment agreement with smic 
under the terms of this agreement  we committed to invest million 
in april  we committed to invest an additional million 
we have received certain capacity commitments from smic 
in fiscal  we made an investment of million in smic  bringing our total investment in this foundry as of september   to million 
an additional million is expected to be invested in fiscal year in june  we entered into a business venture called wafertech  llc with tsmc  altera  analog devices  and private investors to build a wafer fabrication facility in camas  washington 
in december  we sold our investment of million in wafertech to tsmc for million resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in april  the us department of commerce doc published an antidumping duty order on imports of srams from taiwan  from where we currently import a majority of our srams 
as a consequence of this antidumping duty order  we are required to post a cash deposit on imports of taiwan fabricated sram wafers or devices at the ad valorem rate of 
on april   micron technology inc micron requested an administrative review of our taiwan fabricated srams for the period from april  through march  for entries during this period  the cash deposits could be returned to us or  alternatively  we could forfeit amounts deposited and owe duties and interest in addition to the amounts deposited  depending on results of the doc administrative review 
the doc has suspended that review as a consequence of the court decision described below 
we have retained legal counsel to defend our interests in the antidumping proceedings 
in addition  respondents including issi have challenged certain aspects of the antidumping determination in federal court proceedings 
on august   pursuant to an appeal by issi and other respondents  the us court of international trade affirmed the international trade commission itc decision to reverse the itc s earlier ruling supporting the imposition of antidumping duties and rule instead in favor of the respondents 
this decision by the court of international trade was appealed by micron to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit court cafc 
on september   the federal circuit upheld the court of international trade 
this federal circuit decision is subject to appeal 
if no appeal is taken  or if any such appeal is unsuccessful  the antidumping case will be terminated  the order will be revoked  and we will be entitled to a full refund of our cash deposits 
pending resolution of the appeal  the doc will continue to administer the antidumping order 
duties calculated and assessed by the government could have a material adverse affect on our gross margins and profits 
any reviews or proceedings might not mitigate or eliminate antidumping duties 
we believe our existing funds and available financing will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through bank borrowings  sales of additional shares of icsi  the disposition of certain assets  equity financing or debt financing 
from time to time  we may also evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our memory expertise and market strategy  including investments in wafer fabrication foundries 
to the extent we pursue such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
certain factors which may affect our business or future operating results our operating results are expected to continue to fluctuate and may not meet published analyst forecasts 
this may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our future quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors  including the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  decreases in the demand for our products  excess inventory levels at our customers  declines in average selling prices of our products  cancellation of existing orders or the failure to secure new orders  oversupply of memory products in the market  our failure to introduce new products and to implement technologies on a timely basis  market acceptance of ours and our customers products  the failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  failure to deliver products to customers on a timely basis  disruption in the supply of wafers or assembly services  changes in product mix  the timing of significant orders  increased expenses associated with new product introductions or process changes  the ability of customers to make payments to us  and increases in antidumping duties 
we have lost money in certain recent periods  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
we incurred a loss of million  including an inventory write down of million  and a loss of million in the three months ended september  and june   respectively 
we expect to lose money in the december quarter and may lose money in subsequent quarters 
we were profitable for fiscal and fiscal we incurred losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our ability to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including our ability to increase our net sales  introduce new products on a timely basis  secure sufficient wafer fabrication capacity and control our operating expenses 
adverse developments with respect to these or other factors could result in quarterly or annual operating losses in the future 
any continued downturn in the markets we serve would harm our business 
a majority of our products are incorporated into products such as internet access devices  networking equipment  and telecom mobile communications devices 
historically  these markets have from time to time experienced cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  a decline in general economic conditions 
such industry downturns have resulted in reduced product demand and declining average selling prices 
these markets are currently experiencing severely depressed business conditions which are adversely affecting our business 
we are unable to predict how long this current downturn will continue or whether current conditions will worsen 
our sales depend on sram products  and a decline in average selling prices or reduced demand for these products could harm our business 
a majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of sram products  which are subject to unit volume fluctuations and declines in average selling prices which could harm our business 
for example  in the three months ended september   our net sales decreased by to million from million in the three months ended june   principally due to a decline in average selling prices for our products including our sram products 
in addition  in the three months ended june   our net sales decreased by to million from million in the three months ended march   and decreased in the three months ended march  from million in the three months ended december   principally due to a decrease in unit shipments of our sram products as a result of lower demand for electronic products 
further  we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
such declines may not be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
we may not be able to compensate for price decreases in our products 
competitive pricing pressures due to an industry wide oversupply of wafer capacity as well as product inventory resulted in significant price decreases for our products during fiscal through fiscal while we experienced increases in average selling prices in fiscal  historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined  and we expect that average selling prices will decline in the future 
in that regard  we experienced a significant decline in the average selling prices for certain of our products in the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended june  we anticipate a further decline in the average selling prices for certain of our products in the three months ended december  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will depend upon our ability to increase unit sales volume of existing products and introduce and sell new products which compensate for the anticipated declines in the average selling prices of our existing products 
declining average selling prices will also adversely affect our gross margins and profits unless we are able to introduce new products with higher margins or reduce our cost per unit 
we may not be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or reduce our cost per unit 
shifts in industry wide capacity may cause our results to fluctuate 
in the past  such shifts have resulted in significant inventory write downs 
shifts in industry wide capacity from shortages to oversupply or from oversupply to shortages may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is subject to significant downturns resulting from excess capacity  overproduction  reduced demand or technological obsolescence 
these factors can result in a decline in average selling prices and the stated value of inventory 
in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million  including million in the three months ended september  the inventory write downs were predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products  primarily drams and low power srams  and to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
we write down to zero carrying value inventory on hand in excess of six months estimated sales volumes to cover estimated exposures  unless adjustments are made to the forecast based on management s judgments for newer products  end of life products or planned inventory increases 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  management takes into account the product life cycles which can range from to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products  and purchasing opportunities due to excess wafer capacity 
we believe that six months is an appropriate period because it is difficult to accurately forecast for a specific product beyond this time frame due to the potential introduction of products by competitors  technology obsolescence or fluctuations in demand 
our policy regarding excess inventory resulted in inventory write downs for excess inventory of approximately million for fiscal year future additional inventory write downs may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting  excess inventory or inventory obsolescence 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  our business will be harmed 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers from our current or any alternative sources in a timely manner  our business will be harmed 
to date  our principal manufacturing relationship has been with tsmc  from which we have obtained a majority of our wafers 
we also receive wafers from chartered semiconductor and umc 
each of our wafer foundries also supplies wafers to other integrated circuit companies  including certain of our competitors 
although we have written commitments specifying wafer capacities from certain suppliers  if these suppliers experience manufacturing failures or yield shortfalls  choose to prioritize capacity for other uses  or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us  we may not be able to enforce fulfillment of the delivery commitments 
additionally  we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner and we cannot be certain that other manufacturing sources would agree to deliver an adequate supply of wafers to us 
foundry capacity can be limited and we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our future sales would be adversely impacted 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have entered into and expect to enter into various arrangements with suppliers  which could include contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  investments in foundries  joint ventures  other partnership relationships with foundries  option payments or other prepayments to foundries  or nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments 
we may not be able to make any such arrangements in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
we depend on a small number of customers for a high percentage of our sales  and the loss of a significant customer could cause a decline in our profits 
sales to flextronics international accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal substantially all of our sales to flextronics were for products to be delivered to cisco systems  inc shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal sales to com accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal shipments for com directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
however  in fiscal  shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net revenue 
in fiscal  one customer  com  accounted for approximately of net sales 
as sales to these customers are executed pursuant to purchase orders and no purchasing contract exists  these customers can cease doing business with us at any time 
in this regard  we experienced order cancellations from these customers in the march quarter 
we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
we may not be able to retain our strategic customers  such customers may cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  such orders may not be replaced by other sales 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and such fluctuating sales could harm our business 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects also may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  may divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and could harm our relationships with our customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could lessen market acceptance of our products 
our customers could also seek and obtain damages from us for their losses 
although we specifically limit our liability to replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid  a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
strong competition in the semiconductor memory market may harm our business 
the semiconductor memory market is intensely competitive and has been characterized by an oversupply of product  price erosion  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition 
certain of our competitors offer broader product lines and have greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than us 
we may not be able to compete successfully against any of these competitors 
our ability to compete successfully in the high performance memory market depends on factors both within and outside of our control  including real or perceived imbalances in supply and demand  product pricing  the rate at which oem customers incorporate our products into their systems  the success of our customers products  access to advanced process technologies at competitive prices  product functionality  performance and reliability  successful and timely product development  the supply and cost of wafers  achievement of acceptable yields of functional die  the gain or loss of significant customers  and the nature of our competitors and general economic conditions 
in addition  we are vulnerable to technology advances utilized by competitors to manufacture higher performance or lower cost products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future as to any of these factors 
our failure to compete successfully in these or other areas could harm our business 
potential intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
in the semiconductor industry  it is not unusual for companies to receive notices alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we may be infringing patents  maskwork rights or copyrights owned by third parties 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  licenses may not be offered and the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license under a key patent or intellectual property right from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of the products utilizing the invention or to attempt to develop non infringing products  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
furthermore  we may become involved in protracted litigation regarding the alleged infringement by us of third party intellectual property rights or litigation to assert and protect our patents or other intellectual property rights 
any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources which could harm our business 
we have significant international sales and risks related to our international operations could harm our operating results 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the united states  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the united states  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the united states  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on general economic conditions in asia  europe  and the united states 
in addition  the markets for our products  which are highly cyclical  may not continue to grow 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in europe and asia  particularly taiwan and the people s republic of china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws  foreign currency fluctuations  difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivable  and political instability 
we have made strategic equity investments in other companies with no assurance that they will increase in value 
over the last few years  we have made several strategic equity investments in other technology companies 
there can be no assurance that these investments will increase in value and there is the possibility that they could decrease in value over time  even to the point of becoming completely worthless 
these investments are tested for impairment on a recurring basis and any reductions in the carrying value would lower our profitability 
we may encounter difficulties in effectively integrating acquired businesses 
from time to time  we may acquire other companies that would be complementary to our business 
acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses related to intangible assets and the possible impairment of goodwill  which could harm our profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things higher than estimated acquisition expenses  difficulties in successfully assimilating the operations  technologies and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees and customers as a result of the acquisition 
there can be no assurance as to the effect of future acquisitions on our business or operating results 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key technical and management personnel 
our success depends upon the continued service of key technical and management personnel  including jimmy sm lee  chairman and chief executive officer  and gary l 
fischer  president and chief operating officer  as well as on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly experienced circuit designers and process engineers 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we have no employment contracts or key person life insurance policies with or for any of our executive officers 
the loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
terrorist attacks  threats of further attacks  threats of war  and acts of war may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
recent terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers of merchandise  may impact our operations and may  among other things  cause delays or losses in the delivery of wafers or other products to us and decreased sales of our products 
more generally  these events have affected  and will continue to affect  the general economy and customer demand for products sold by our customers 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues  and costs  which in turn may result in increased volatility in our common stock price and could adversely affect the future price of our common stock 
our stock price is expected to be volatile
