item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the three year period ended december   the company increased its revenue at a compounded annual growth rate of  as revenue increased from million in to million in a significant increase in fleet size to meet customer demand as well as an increase in the freight rates contributed to revenue growth over this period 
in addition to internal growth  the company completed six acquisitions during the three year period ended december  the acquired operations generated approximately million in combined revenue 
the company intends to continue to grow both internally and through acquisitions 
the main constraints on internal growth are the ability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and  in times of slower economic growth  to add profitable freight 
the company s acquisitions of srt  atw  harold ives  and cts have resulted in changes in several operating statistics and expense categories 
these operations use predominately single driver tractors  as opposed to the primarily team driver tractor fleet operated by covenant s long haul operation 
the single driver fleets operate fewer miles per tractor and experience more empty miles 
the additional expenses and lower productive miles are offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced employee expense of compensating only one driver 
in addition  the company s refrigerated services must bear additional expenses of fuel for refrigeration units  pallets  and depreciation and interest expense of more expensive trailers associated with temperature controlled service 
the company s operating statistics and expenses are expected to continue to shift in future periods with the mix of single  team  and temperature controlled operations 
in  the company initiated the use of owner operators 
the company contracted with an average of owner operators in  owner operators in  and owner operators in owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and bear all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed lease payment per mile 
in addition  the company does not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
the company also entered into operating leases 
in  the company had tractors and trailers financed under operating leases 
in  the company had tractors and trailers financed under operating leases 
in  the company had  tractors and  trailers financed under operating leases 
the lease payments to owner operators and the financing of revenue equipment under operating leases appear as operating expenses under revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
for leased equipment  expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for owner operator tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from owner operators and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  the company evaluates its efficiency using pretax margin and net margin rather than operating ratio 
effective july   the company merged its logistics business with the logistics business of five other transportation companies into transplace 
com  llc transplace 
com 
transplace 
com operates an internet based global transportation logistics service and is developing programs for the cooperative purchasing of products  supplies  and services 
in the transaction  covenant contributed its logistics customer list  logistics business software and software licenses  certain intellectual property  and million in cash for the initial funding of the venture 
in exchange  covenant received ownership in transplace 
com 
upon completion of the transaction  covenant ceased operating its own transportation logistics and brokerage business  which consisted primarily of the terminal truck broker  inc business acquired in november the contributed operation generated approximately million in net brokerage revenue gross revenue less purchased transportation expense received on an annualized basis 
the company recognized approximately  of pretax earnings related to transplace 
com during the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for each of the three years ended december revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and related expenses fuel  oil  and road expenses revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation repairs operating taxes and licenses insurance communications and utilities general supplies and expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue increased million  to million in  from million in the revenue increase was primarily generated by a increase in weighted average tractors  to  in  from  in  as the company expanded externally through the acquisitions of the stock of harold ives trucking co 
and the asset acquisitions from atw and cts 
the company s average revenue per loaded mile increased to approximately in  from in the increase was attributable primarily to per mile rate increases negotiated by the company 
revenue per total mile increased to approximately in  from in the company s growth was affected by a decrease in revenue per tractor per week to  in from  in revenue per tractor per week was reduced because of fewer miles per tractor due to a less robust freight environment than in and the acquisition of harold ives trucking co 
and cts  which operated single driver tractors that generate fewer miles than team driven tractors 
salaries  wages  and related expenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses increased to in  from in driver wages as a percentage of revenue remained essentially constant at in  and in the company increased driver wages in october and in april these increases were offset as the company utilized more owner operators and had a larger percentage of single driver tractors from the operations of srt  harold ives  and cts  which only have one driver to be compensated 
non driving employee payroll expense remained essentially constant at of revenue in the period and of revenue in the period 
health insurance  employer paid taxes  and workers compensation increased to of revenue in  from in the increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of increased group health insurance claims in as compared to fuel  oil  and road expenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  oil  and road expenses decreased to in from in during  average fuel costs for the year increased approximately per gallon versus the increase in was offset by fuel surcharges  which are included as a reduction in fuel cost  fuel hedges in the form of fixed price purchase commitments  and by the increased usage of owner operators who pay for their own fuel purchases 
fuel surcharges amounted to nearly 
per mile or approximately million during compared with less than one cent per mile or approximately million during the company s percentage of fuel purchases that are hedged was approximately in and approximately for the year revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to in from in during  the company began using owner operators  who provide a tractor and driver and cover all of their operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
accordingly  expenses such as driver salaries  fuel  repairs  depreciation  and interest normally associated with company owned equipment are consolidated in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation when owner operators are utilized 
the company increased the fleet size of owner operators to an average of in  compared to in  a increase 
the company also entered into additional operating leases 
as of december   the company had financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases as compared to tractors and trailers under operating leases as of december  the equipment leases will increase this expense category in the future  while reducing depreciation and interest expenses 
repairs increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  repairs increased to in  from in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of tractors and trailers damaged in accidents  an increase in the number of tractors and trailers available for routine maintenance due to the slower freight environment  and repair requirements associated with the trade in of a large number of tractors during the fourth quarter operating taxes and licenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  operating taxes and licenses increased to in  from in  partially due to increased fleet size and additional property taxes related to facilities 
insurance  consisting primarily of premiums for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance  and claims  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance increased to in  from in the increase was primarily related to the company experiencing an increase in the cost of one of its insurance lines in july  and the payment of a claim to one of its customers that the insurance company had denied in the amount of approximately  the company has other insurance lines that will be due for renewal in the first quarter of management expects that an increase in insurance premiums and deductibles will cause this expense category to be higher in future periods 
communications and utilities increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained essentially constant at in as compared to in general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal lease expense  and driver recruiting expenses  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  general supplies and expenses increased to in from in the increase was primarily the result of expenses incurred from the acquisitions related to atw  harold ives  and cts  as well as the addition of a driving school located in arkansas 
depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in  from in  because the company utilized more owner operators  leased more revenue equipment through operating leases  and extended the depreciable life of the company s trailers from seven years to eight years to conform with the company s actual experience of equipment life 
these factors offset lower revenue per tractor 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from five acquisitions  as well as goodwill from eight acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the sale of tractors and trailers 
gain on sale of tractors and trailers was approximately million in and  in the predictability of any gain loss on the sale of equipment is difficult due to the market value of used equipment varies from year to year 
the unpredictability of gains losses could impact depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began reserving against tractor values  which will affect this line item in future periods 
interest expense increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  interest expense increased to in  from in  as the result of higher debt balances related to the acquisitions  the investment in transplace 
com  and the stock repurchase program as well as higher interest rates 
the increase was partially offset by utilizing more owner operators and leasing more revenue equipment 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s pre tax margin decreased to in compared with in the company s effective tax rate remained essentially constant at in  and in the company implemented certain tax planning stategies during and expects to incur an effective tax rate of approximately in as a result of the factors described above  net income decreased million  to million in of revenue  from million in of revenue 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue increased million  to million in from million in the revenue increase was primarily generated by a increase in weighted average tractors  to  in  from  in  as the company expanded internally to serve new customers and higher volumes from existing customers  as well as externally through the acquisitions of gouge in august  srt in october  atw in september  and harold ives in november the company s average revenue per loaded mile increased to approximately in  from in the increase was attributable primarily to per mile rate increases negotiated by the company 
the increase in average revenue per loaded mile more than offset an increase in the empty miles percentage 
revenue per total mile increased to approximately in  from in salaries  wages  and related expenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses decreased to in  from in driver wages as a percentage of revenue decreased to in  from in  because the company utilized more owner operators and a larger percentage of single driver tractors from the operations of srt  and harold ives  which only have one driver to be compensated 
a driver wage increase that went into effect in october  and an additional increase planned for early are expected to increase driver wages as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
the company experienced an increase in non driving employee payroll expense to of revenue in the period from of revenue in the period due to the start up of covenant transport logistics and the acquisitions of srt and harold ives 
health insurance  employer paid taxes  and workers compensation decreased to of revenue in  from in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of improved group health insurance rates in as compared to the rates 
fuel  oil  and road expenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  oil  and road expenses decreased to in from in during  average fuel costs for the year increased approximately per gallon versus the increase in was more than offset by fuel surcharges  fuel hedges  and by the increased usage of owner operators who pay for their own fuel purchases 
however  fuel prices rose sharply during the fourth quarter of and remain elevated at levels much higher than the average in or thus  fuel  oil  and road expenses are anticipated to increase as a percentage of revenue in fuel surcharges amounted to nearly 
per mile or approximately million during fuel surcharges were not triggered during the company s percentage of fuel purchases that are hedged was approximately in and is approximately for the year revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to in from in during  the company began using owner operators of revenue equipment  who provide a tractor and driver and cover all of their operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
accordingly  expenses such as driver salaries  fuel  repairs  depreciation  and interest normally associated with company owned equipment are consolidated in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation when owner operators are utilized 
the company increased the fleet size of owner operators to an average of in  compared to in  an increase of 
the company also entered into additional operating leases 
during  an average of approximately tractors were leased compared to an average of approximately leased tractors during the equipment leases will increase this expense category in the future  while reducing depreciation and interest 
the company also formed a logistics division in the fourth quarter of that is being reflected in this expense category as well 
repairs increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  repairs decreased to in  from in as a percentage of revenue  repairs decreased due to the increased number of owner operators who are responsible for their own repairs  which more than offset additional repairs associated with a slight increase in fleet age 
operating taxes and licenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  operating taxes and licenses decreased to in  from in  due to increased revenue per tractor more efficiently spreading this largely fixed cost 
insurance  consisting primarily of premiums for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance  and claims  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance decreased to in  from in  as the company continued to reduce premiums per million dollars of revenue

depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in  from in  because the company utilized more owner operators  leased more revenue equipment  and realized an increase in revenue per tractor per week  which more efficiently spread this fixed cost over a larger revenue base 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from two  one  and two business acquisitions  as well as goodwill from two  two  and three acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the sale of tractors and trailers 
gain on sale of tractors and trailers was approximately million in  and  in the market for used tractors deteriorated late in  and into if the prices for used equipment remain depressed  the company may recognize less gain or a loss on the sale of its tractors and trailers  which would impact depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue 
interest expense decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  interest expense decreased to in  from in  as the result of utilizing more owner operators and leasing more revenue equipment 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s pretax margin remained essentially constant at in  compared with in the company s effective tax rate was in  and in  due to the company paying taxes to a greater number of states 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million  to million in of revenue  from million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources the continued growth of the company s business has required significant investments in new revenue equipment and upgraded and expanded facilities 
the company historically has financed its expansion requirements with borrowings under a line of credit  cash flows from operations  long term operating leases  and a small portion with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers 
the company s primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations  proceeds under the securitization facility as defined below  and borrowings under its primary credit agreement  which had maximum available borrowing of million at december  the credit agreement 
the company believes its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its current and projected needs 
the company s current liabilities increased significantly as a result of the receipt of million of proceeds from the securitization facility 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease on the line of credit facility  which is classified as a long term liability 
as discussed in the financial statement footnotes  the net proceeds under the securitization facility are required to be shown as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
the company s primary sources of cash flow from operations in were net income increased by depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes 
the most significant uses of cash provided by operations were to fund prepaid expenses primarily increased insurance deposits and license plates for revenue equipment and to finance increases in receivables and advances associated with growth in the business 
the company s number of days sales in accounts receivable decreased from days in  to days in net cash provided by operating activities was million in  and million in net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire additional revenue equipment and expand facilities as the company expanded its operations 
during  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the company acquiring a greater percentage of its revenue equipment through operating leases which do not require a capital outlay for purchasing the equipment 
in addition  during the period  investing activity was used to repurchase company stock  to invest in transplace 
com  and to acquire the assets of cts 
approximately million represented the purchase price for the assets and business of cts  of which approximately million was allocated to goodwill 
the company expects capital expenditures  primarily for revenue equipment net of trade ins to be approximately million in  exclusive of acquisitions 
in june  the company authorized a stock repurchase plan for up to million company shares to be purchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
in july  the company authorized an additional  shares to be repurchased 
as of december  a total of  had been purchased with an average price of 
the stock repurchase program has no expiration date 
during the third quarter of  the company merged its logistics business with the logistics business of five other transportation companies into transplace 
com 
in the transaction  covenant contributed its logistics customer list  logistics business software and software licenses  certain intellectual property  and million in cash for the initial funding of the venture 
in exchange  covenant received ownership in transplace 
com 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the period  and financing activities in the period provided approximately million 
the primary source of cash for was provided by borrowings under the credit agreement and securitization facility 
the decrease in was primarily due to the company entering into operating leases 
at december   the company had outstanding debt of million  primarily consisting of million in the securitization facility  million drawn under the credit agreement  million in year senior notes  million in term equipment financing  a million interest bearing note to the former primary stockholder of srt  and  in notes related to non compete agreements 
interest rates on this debt range from to 
in december  the company entered into the credit agreement with a group of banks  which matures december borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the banks base rate or libor and accrue interest based on one  two  or three month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage 
at december   the margin was 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by the company and all of the company s subsidiaries except cvti receivables corp 
the credit agreement has a maximum borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of net book value of revenue equipment or million 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit agreement includes a security agreement such that the credit agreement may be collateralized by virtually all assets of the company if a covenant violation occurs 
a commitment fee  that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on cash flow coverage  is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
in december  the company entered into a million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility the securitization facility 
on a revolving basis  the company sells its interests in its accounts receivable to cvti receivables corp 
crc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary incorporated in nevada 
crc sells a percentage ownership in such receivables to an unrelated financial entity 
the company can receive up to million of proceeds  subject to eligible receivables and will pay a service fee recorded as interest expense  based on commercial paper interest rates plus an applicable margin of per annum and a commitment fee of per annum on the daily unused portion of the facility 
the securitization facility is subject to annual renewal 
as of december  there were million in proceeds received 
in december  the company amended and restated its million note purchase agreement with an insurance company 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually  and mature on october  principal payments are due in five equal annual installments beginning in proceeds of the notes were used to reduce borrowings under the credit agreement 
the company s headquarters facility was completed in december  the cost of the approximately acres and construction of the headquarters and shop buildings was approximately million 
the company financed the land and improvements under a build to suit operating lease 
this operating lease expires march  and the company anticipates refinancing the facility under the credit agreement 
the company has completed the construction of an approximately  square foot addition to the office building and has completed improvements on an additional acres of land 
the cost of these activities in was million  which was also financed under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement  securitization facility  senior notes  and the headquarters and terminal lease agreement contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness 
all of these instruments are cross defaulted 
the company was in compliance with the agreements at december  inflation and fuel costs most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
fuel expense comprises a larger percentage of revenue for covenant than many other carriers because of covenant s long average length of haul 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  increases usually are not fully recovered 
in the fourth quarter of  fuel prices escalated rapidly and have remained high throughout this has increased the company s cost of operating 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
for the reasons stated  first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year 
the company s equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and the company s ability to satisfy some of that requirement 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by the company s dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting the company s equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during   and the company believes that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality of its business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
equipment utilization table miles per tractor per period first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter factors that may affect future results a number of factors over which the company has little or no control may affect the company s future results 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
fuel price the price of diesel fuel escalated rapidly in late and continued at high levels throughout fuel is one of the company s largest operating expense  and high fuel prices have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
continued high fuel prices may affect the company s future results 
resale of used revenue equipment the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used tractors experienced a sharp drop in late and into if the prices for used equipment remain depressed  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there has been since  and and continues to be an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to driver employees  curtail the company s growth  or experience the adverse effects of tractors without drivers 
competition the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  railroads  rail intermodal service  and to some extent with air freight service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates than competitors that offer a lower level of service 
regulation the trucking industry is subject to various governmental regulations 
the dot is considering a proposal that may limit the hours in service during which a driver may operate a tractor and a proposal that would require installing certain safety equipment on tractors 
although the company is unable to predict the nature of any changes in regulations  the cost of any changes  if implemented  may adversely affect the profitability of the company 
insurance and claims in the company adopted an insurance program with significantly higher deductibles 
an increase in the number or severity of accidents  stolen equipment  or other loss events over those anticipated could have a materially adverse effect on the company s profitability 
acquisitions a significant portion of the company s growth has occurred through acquisitions  and acquisitions are an important component of the company s growth strategy 
management must continue to identify desirable target companies and negotiate  finance  and close acceptable transactions or the company s growth could suffer 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company may engage in hedging activities using futures  forward contracts  options  and swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations on energy commodity prices and interest rates 
the company will be required to adopt the standard in and has determined there will not be any material adverse impact on its results of operations or financial position resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from changes in i certain commodity prices and ii certain interest rates on its debt 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are generally outside the company s control 
because the company s operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
historically  the company has been able to recover a portion of short term fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
for  diesel fuel expenses represented of the company s total operating expenses and of total revenue 
the company uses purchase commitments through suppliers to reduce a portion of its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
at december   the national average price of diesel fuel as provided by the us department of energy was per gallon 
at december   the notional amount for purchase commitments during was million gallons 
at december   the price of the notional million gallons would have produced approximately  of income to offset increased fuel prices if the price of fuel remained the same as of december  at december   a ten percent change in the price of fuel would increase or decrease the gain on fuel purchase commitments by  the company does not enter into contracts with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  nor does it trade in these instruments when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk the credit agreement  provided there has been no default  carries a maximum variable interest rate of libor for the corresponding period plus 
at december   the company had drawn million under the credit agreement  which is subject to variable rates 
considering all debt outstanding  each one percentage point increase or decrease in libor would affect the company s pretax interest expense by  on an annualized basis
