item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
this discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 
introduction this annual report on form k is filed jointly by xm satellite radio holdings inc and xm satellite radio inc 
xm is a wholly owned subsidiary of holdings 
accordingly  the management s discussion and analysis section of this report focuses on the financial condition and results of operations of holdings but contains an explanation of any differences  if applicable  between the two companies 
overview xm satellite radio inc was incorporated in delaware in as a wholly owned subsidiary of motient corporation  formerly american mobile satellite corporation 
xm satellite radio holdings inc became a holding company for xm satellite radio inc in early we are in the development stage 
since our inception in december  we have devoted our efforts to establishing and commercializing the xm radio system 
our activities were fairly limited until  when we pursued and obtained regulatory approval from the fcc to provide satellite radio service 
our principal activities to date have included 
designing and developing the xm radio system  
negotiating contracts with satellite and launch vehicle operators  specialty programmers  radio manufacturers and car manufacturers  
developing technical standards and specifications  
conducting market research  and 
securing financing for working capital and capital expenditures 
we have raised billion to date  which is described under the heading liquidity and capital resources funds raised for period through commencement of commercial operations 
we have incurred substantial losses to date and expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to design  develop and deploy the xm radio system and for some period following our commencement of commercial operations 
we intend to capitalize all costs related to our satellite contract and our fcc license  including all applicable interest 
these capitalized costs will be depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the satellites and ground control stations 
depreciation of our satellites will commence upon in orbit delivery 
depreciation of our satellite control facilities and terrestrial repeaters and the amortization of our fcc license will commence upon commercial operations 
after we begin commercial operations  which we are targeting for the summer of  we anticipate that our revenues will consist primarily of customers subscription fees and advertising revenues 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  xm satellite radio holdings inc and subsidiaries research and development 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in  compared with approximately million in the increase in the research and development expenses primarily resulted from increased activity relating to our system technology development  including chipset design and uplink technology  in professional fees 
professional fees increased to approximately million in  compared with million in the increase primarily reflects additional services of consultants  including incurring million for software selection and workflow process development 
we expect the professional fees to trend upward as we continue to develop marketing strategies 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared with million in the increase reflects increased headcount  facilities and sales and marketing expenses 
we have granted certain key executives stock options and incurred a non cash compensation charge of approximately million in primarily for performance based stock options 
we also recorded non cash compensation charges of approximately million during relating to options repriced in we also continued the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles during we anticipate general and administrative expenses to continue to increase through commercial operations 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in  compared with million in the increase was the result of higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents in  due to the proceeds from the private placement of senior secured notes and warrants  the public offerings of class a common stock and series b convertible redeemable preferred stock and the private placement of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock  all in the first nine months of  which exceeded expenditures for satellite and launch vehicle construction  other capital expenditures and operating expenses 
interest expense 
we incurred interest costs of and million in and  respectively 
we capitalized interest costs of million and million associated with our fcc license and the xm radio system in and  respectively 
the increase in interest costs was the result of the incurrence of new debt during the first quarter of  which exceeded the reduction in interest due to the conversion of all debt into equity in the fourth quarter of further  the interest capitalization threshold was exceeded in net loss 
the net loss for and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in net losses in compared with reflects increases in research and development and professional fees expenses  and additional general and administration expenses  primarily due to increased headcount  facility  and sales and marketing expenses in preparation for commercial operations and the amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
xm satellite radio inc and subsidiaries the results of operations for xm and its subsidiaries were substantially the same as the results for holdings and its subsidiaries discussed above for in  xm recognized million less interest income due to the timing of capital contributions from holdings and substantially less interest expense as holdings million charge to interest for the beneficial conversion feature of the new motient note and holdings exceeding its capitalization threshold by million were not allocated to xm 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  xm satellite radio holdings inc and subsidiaries research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in  compared with million in the decrease in research and development expenses resulted from the completion of the development of some of our system technology during professional fees 
professional fees increased to approximately million in  compared with million in the increase primarily reflects additional legal  regulatory and marketing expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared with million in the increase primarily reflects increased headcount and facility expenses to begin program management and operations 
we also commenced the amortization of our goodwill and intangibles resulting from motient s acquisition of a former investor s interest in us during we have granted certain key executives stock options and incurred a non cash compensation charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of primarily for performance based stock options 
we will continue to incur quarterly non cash compensation charges over the vesting period depending on the market value of our class a common stock 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in  compared with  which was insignificant 
the increase was the result of higher average balances of cash and short term investments during due to the proceeds from the issuance of series a convertible notes in the third quarter of exceeding the amounts of expenditures for satellite and launch vehicle construction  other capital expenditures and operating expenses 
interest expense 
as of december  and  we owed and million  respectively  including accrued interest  under various debt agreements which we entered into for the purpose of financing the xm radio system 
our capitalized interest costs were million and million associated with our fcc license and the xm radio system during and  respectively 
we expensed interest costs of million and during and  respectively 
we incurred a one time million charge to interest due to the beneficial conversion feature of the new motient note 
we also exceeded our interest capitalization threshold by million 
net loss 
the net loss for and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in net losses for  compared with  primarily reflects an increase in net interest expense as discussed above and additional general and administration expenses  primarily due to increased headcount and facility expenses  in preparation for commercial operations and the commencement of amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
xm satellite radio inc and subsidiaries the results of operations for xm and its subsidiaries were substantially the same as the results for holdings and its subsidiaries discussed above  except that in  xm recognized million less interest income due to the timing of capital contributions from holdings and substantially less interest expense as holdings million charge to interest for the beneficial conversion feature of the new motient note and holdings exceeding its capitalization threshold by million were not allocated to xm 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a total of cash and cash equivalents of million  which excludes million of current restricted investments  and working capital of million 
giving effect to the concurrent offerings detailed below  as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which excludes million of current restricted investments  and working capital of million on a pro forma basis 
by comparison  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and working capital equaled million at december  the increases in the respective balances are due primarily to the proceeds from the financings described below 
funds raised for period through commencement of commercial operations since inception  we have raised an aggregate of billion  net of expenses  interest reserve and repayment of debt 
these funds are expected to be sufficient  in the absence of additional financing  to cover funding needs through commencement of commercial operations in the summer of and into these funds have been used to acquire our fcc license  make required payments for our system  including the satellites  terrestrial repeater system  and ground networks  and for working capital and operating expenses 
sources of funds 
of the billion raised to date  approximately million  excluding the class a common stock acquired by motient corporation as part of our initial public offering  has been raised through the issuance of equity to  and receipt of loans from  motient corporation and a former stockholder 
of this amount  approximately million and million was raised in and  respectively  and million was raised in january in july  we issued million of series a subordinated convertible notes to six strategic and financial investors general motors  million  clear channel communications  million  directv  million  and columbia capital  telcom ventures  llc and madison dearborn partners  million in the aggregate 
using part of the proceeds from the issuance of the series a subordinated convertible notes  we paid a former stockholder million in july to redeem an outstanding loan 
we incurred fees and expenses totaling million in connection with these transactions 
in october  we completed an initial public offering which yielded net proceeds of million 
concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering  million of our series a subordinated convertible notes  together with associated accrued interest  converted into shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and shares of our class a common stock 
additionally  million of convertible notes issued to motient by us  together with associated accrued interest  converted into shares of our class b common stock 
during the fiscal year ended december  
we completed a follow on offering of  shares of class a common stock  yielding net proceeds of million  
we completed a concurrent offering of  shares of our series b convertible redeemable preferred stock  which yielded net proceeds of million  
we completed a private placement of  units  each consisting of  principal amount of senior secured notes due of xm  and one warrant to purchase shares of our class a common stock at per share that provided net proceeds of million excluding million for an interest reserve  and 
we closed a private offering of  shares of our series c convertible redeemable preferred stock  which yielded net proceeds of approximately million 
we recorded a million beneficial conversion charge that reduced earnings available to common stockholders 
the issuance of the series c preferred stock also caused the exercise price of the warrants sold in march to be adjusted to and the number of warrant shares to be increased to per warrant 
following the end of the fiscal year ended december   in march  we completed a follow on offering of  shares of class a common stock  which yielded net proceeds of million  and a concurrent offering of convertible subordinated notes due  convertible into shares of our class a common stock at per share  which yielded net proceeds of million 
these issuances caused the conversion price of the series c preferred stock to be adjusted from to and the exercise price of the warrants sold in march to be adjusted to and the number of warrant shares to be increased to per warrant 
through december   the proceeds from these offerings were contributed by holdings to xm except for  which remains at holdings 
uses of funds 
of the approximately billion of funds raised to date  as of december   we have paid million in capital expenditures  including approximately million for our fcc licence which has been paid for in full  and incurred million in operating expenses 
satellite contract 
under our satellite contract  boeing satellite systems international  inc formerly hughes space and communications  inc 
will deliver two satellites in orbit and is to complete construction of a ground spare satellite 
boeing will also provide ground equipment and software to be used in the xm radio system and certain launch and operations support services 
we expect that by commencement of commercial operations in the summer of  we will have had to pay an aggregate amount of approximately million for these items 
this amount does not include incentive payments  which will depend in part on projected satellite performance at the acceptance date 
such payments could total up to an additional million over the useful lives of the satellites 
as of december   we had paid approximately million under our satellite contract and have recognized an additional million in accrued milestone payments 
launch insurance 
we expect that launch insurance for both satellites will cost approximately million 
as of december   we had paid million with respect to launch insurance 
terrestrial repeater system 
based on the current design of the xm radio system and existing contracts  we estimate that through our expected commencement of operations in the summer of we will incur aggregate costs of approximately million for a terrestrial repeater system 
we expect these costs to cover the capital cost of the design  development and installation of a system of terrestrial repeaters to cover approximately cities and metropolitan areas 
as of december   we had incurred costs with respect to the terrestrial repeater buildout of million 
in august  we signed a contract with lcc international  inc  a related party  that presently calls for payments of approximately million for engineering and site preparation 
as of december   we had paid million under this contract and accrued an additional million 
we have also engaged other companies to perform site preparation services 
we also entered into a contract effective october   with hughes electronics corporation for the design  development and manufacture of the terrestrial repeaters 
payments under this contract are expected to be approximately million 
as of december   we had paid million under this contract 
ground segment 
based on the design of the xm radio system  available research and existing contracts  we expect to incur aggregate ground segment costs through the expected commencement of operations in the summer of of approximately million 
we expect these costs will cover the satellite control facilities  programming production studios and various other equipment and facilities 
as of december   we had incurred million with respect to the ground segment 
fcc license 
in october  we received one of two satellite radio licenses issued by the fcc 
we have paid approximately million for this license  including the initial bid right 
there are no further payments required relating to the license 
operating expenses 
from inception through december   we have incurred total operating expenses of million 
joint development agreement funding requirements 
we may require additional funds to pay license fees or make contributions towards the development of the technologies used to develop a unified standard for satellite radios under our joint development agreement with sirius radio 
each party is obligated to fund one half of the development cost for such technologies 
each party will be entitled to license fees or a credit towards its one half of the cost based upon the validity  value  use  importance and available alternatives of the technology it contributes 
in our discussions we have yet to agree on the validity  value  use  importance and available alternatives of our respective technologies 
if we fail to reach agreement  the fees or credits may be determined through binding arbitration 
we cannot predict at this time the amount of license fees or contribution payable by us or sirius radio or the size of the credits to us and sirius radio from the use of the other s technology 
this may require significant additional capital 
funds required following commencement of commercial operations we expect to need significant additional funds following commencement of commercial operations to cover our cash requirements before we generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover our expenses 
we estimate that our existing resources  including proceeds of offerings concluded in march  would be sufficient in the absence of additional financing to cover our estimated funding needs into  including funding needs of million required through the end of to be used for marketing  system operating expenses and general corporate purposes 
after  we anticipate that we will need an additional million through  and we will require additional funding thereafter 
these amounts are estimates  and may change  and we may need additional financing in excess of these estimates 
funds will be needed to cover operating expenses  marketing and promotional expenses including an extensive marketing campaign in connection with the launch of our service  distribution expenses  programming costs and any further development of the xm radio system that we may undertake after operations commence 
marketing and distribution expenses are expected to include joint advertising and joint development with and manufacturing subsidies of certain costs of some of our manufacturers and distribution partners 
we cannot estimate the total amount of these operational  promotional  subscriber acquisition  joint development and manufacturing costs and expenses  since they vary depending upon different criteria  but they are expected to be substantial 
we will have significant payment obligations after commencement of operations under our distribution agreement with general motors 
we will pay an aggregate of approximately million in the first four years following commencement of commercial service 
after that  through  we will have additional fixed annual payments ranging from less than million to approximately million  aggregating approximately million 
in order to encourage the broad installation of xm radios  we have agreed to subsidize a portion of the cost of xm radios and to make incentive payments to general motors when the owners of general motors vehicles with installed xm radios become subscribers for the xm radio service 
we must also share with general motors a percentage of the subscription revenue attributable to general motors vehicles with installed xm radios 
this percentage increases until there are more than eight million general motors vehicles with installed xm radios 
this agreement is subject to renegotiation if general motors does not achieve and maintain specified installation levels  starting with million units after four years and thereafter increasing by the lesser of  units per year and amounts proportionate to our share of the satellite digital radio market 
we currently expect to satisfy our funding requirements for the period following commencement of commercial operations by selling debt or equity securities and by obtaining loans or other credit lines from banks or other financial institutions 
if we are successful in raising additional financing  we anticipate that a significant portion of the financing will consist of debt 
we are actively considering possible financings  and because of our substantial capital needs we may consummate one or more financings at any time 
we may not be able to raise any funds or obtain loans on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain the required financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in developing  implementing and marketing our satellite radio service  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders 
if we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis  a number of adverse effects could occur 
we could default on our commitments to creditors or others and may have to discontinue operations or seek a purchaser for our business or assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin 
fin further defines the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fin became effective on july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  in july  we repriced  options and fin requires that these options be accounted for as variable from july  until the date the award is exercised  is forfeited  or expires unexercised 
for those options that have vested as of july   compensation cost is recognized only to the extent that the exercise price exceeds the stock price on july  for those options that have not vested as of july   the portion of the award s intrinsic value measured at july  is recognized over the remaining vesting period 
additional compensation cost is measured for the full amount of any increases in stock price after the effective date and is recognized over the remaining vesting period 
any adjustment to compensation cost for further changes in the stock price after the award vests is recognized immediately 
the effects of implementing fin required us to recognize additional non cash compensation of million during the fiscal year ended december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activity  an amendment of sfas sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after  we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january  we have reviewed our contracts and determined that we have no derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments and do not intend to use derivatives 
we invest our cash in short term commercial paper and investment grade corporate and government obligations and money market funds 
our long term debt includes a fixed interest rate and the fair market value of the debt is sensitive to changes to interest rates 
we run the risk that market rates will decline and the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not material to our results of operations
