item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of healthsouth  including various factors related to acquisitions we have made during the periods indicated  the timing and nature of which have significantly affected our consolidated results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we completed the following major acquisitions over the last three years o on july   we acquired columbia hca healthcare corporation s interest in or entered into interim management arrangements with respect to outpatient surgery centers located in states the columbia hca acquisition 
the cash purchase price was approximately  o on july   we acquired national surgery centers  inc the nsc acquisition 
a total of  shares of healthsouth common stock were issued in connection with the transaction  representing a value of approximately  at that time  nsc operated outpatient surgery centers in states 
o on june   we acquired from mariner post acute network  inc mariner substantially all of the assets of mariner s american rehability services division the rehability acquisition  which operated approximately outpatient rehabilitation centers in states 
the net cash purchase price was approximately  each of the columbia hca acquisition and the rehability acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the acquired operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
the nsc acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  with the exception of data set forth relating to revenues derived from medicare and medicaid  all amounts shown in the following discussion have been restated to reflect such acquisitions 
nsc did not separately track such revenues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we determine the amortization period of the cost in excess of net asset value of purchased facilities based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each individual purchase transaction 
the evaluation includes an analysis of historic and projected financial performance  an evaluation of the estimated useful life of the buildings and fixed assets acquired  the indefinite useful life of certificates of need and licenses acquired  the competition within local markets  lease terms where applicable  and the legal terms of partnerships where applicable 
we utilize independent appraisers and rely on our own management expertise in evaluating each of the factors noted above 
with respect to the carrying value of the excess of cost over net asset value of individual purchased facilities and other intangible assets  we determine on a quarterly basis whether an impairment event has occurred by considering factors such as the market value of the asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action by regulators  a history of operating losses or cash flow losses  or a projection of continuing losses associated with an operating entity 
the carrying value of excess cost over net asset value of purchased facilities and other intangible assets will be evaluated if the facts and circumstances suggest that it has been impaired 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset will not be recoverable  as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period  our carrying value of the asset will be reduced by the estimated shortfall of cash flows to the estimated fair market value

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information requires an enterprise to report operating segments based upon the way its operations are managed 
this approach defines operating segments along the lines used by management to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions 
based on our management and reporting structure  segment information has been presented for inpatient and other clinical services  outpatient services east and outpatient services west 
the inpatient and other clinical services segment primarily includes the operations of our inpatient rehabilitation facilities and medical centers  as well as the operations of certain physician practices and other clinical services which are managerially aligned with our inpatient services 
the outpatient services segments primarily include the operations of our outpatient rehabilitation facilities  outpatient surgery centers and outpatient diagnostic centers and follow the geographic management reporting structure we use for our outpatient services operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for financial data for each of our operating segments 
our revenues include net patient service revenues and other operating revenues 
net patient service revenues are reported at estimated net realizable amounts from patients  insurance companies  third party payors primarily medicare and medicaid and others for services rendered 
revenues from third party payors also include estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements which are subject to final review and settlement by appropriate authorities 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each facility  and contractual adjustments based on historical experience and the terms of payor contracts 
net accounts receivable include only those amounts we estimate to be collectible 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from private and governmental third party payors 
our reimbursement from governmental third party payors is based upon cost reports and other reimbursement mechanisms which require the application and interpretation of complex regulations and policies  and such reimbursement is subject to various levels of review and adjustment by fiscal intermediaries and others  which may affect the final determination of reimbursement 
in addition  there are increasing pressures from many payor sources to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and third party payor programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels 
in addition  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of proposals to limit medicare reimbursement for certain services 
we cannot now predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted and implemented  what effect such proposals would have on us 
changes in reimbursement policies or rates by private or governmental payors could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations 
in many cases  we operate more than one site within a market 
in such markets  there is customarily an outpatient center or inpatient facility with associated satellite outpatient locations 
for purposes of the following discussion and analysis  same store operations are measured on locations within markets in which similar operations existed at the end of the period and include the operations of additional locations opened within the same market 
new store operations are measured on locations within new markets 
we may  from time to time  close or consolidate similar locations in multi site markets to obtain efficiencies and respond to changes in demand 
results of operations twelve month periods ended december  and our operations generated revenues of  in  an increase of  or  as compared to revenues 
same store revenues for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  as compared to the same period in  excluding discontinued home health operations 
new store revenues for were  the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the addition of new operations and increases in patient volume 
revenues generated from patients under the medicare and medicaid programs respectively accounted for and of total revenues for  compared to and of total revenues for revenues from any other single third party payor were not significant in relation to our total revenues 
during  same store inpatient days  outpatient visits  surgical cases and diagnostic cases increased   and  respectively 
revenue per inpatient day  outpatient visit  surgical case and diagnostic case for same store operations decreased by   and  respectively 
operating expenses expenses excluding corporate general and administrative expenses  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization and interest expense were  or of revenues  for  compared to of revenues for included in operating expenses for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  which related primarily to our plan to write off obsolete equipment 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed equipment that had originally been acquired through various company mergers and acquisitions 
during the acquisitions it was our intention to either continue using the equipment or transfer it to other locations where it could be utilized 
during the fourth quarter of  an obsolescence charge was taken based on our determination that certain equipment was obsolete due to changes in available technologies 
excluding the non recurring expense  operating expenses were  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to the decline in same store revenues per inpatient day  outpatient visit  surgical case and diagnostic case 
same store operating expenses for  excluding the non recurring expense item noted above  were  or of related revenues 
new store operating expenses were  or of related revenues 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in included in corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  this expense item included write offs of investments and notes of  expenses related to year remediation of  and expenses related to the proposed spin off of our inpatient operations of  as part of our evaluation of the proposed spin off in  we determined that certain notes and investments totaling  should be written off 
the year remediation expenditures were incurred during while testing for year compliance 
excluding the non recurring expense  as a percentage of revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses increased from in to in total operating expenses were  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for included in the provision for doubtful accounts is  in expense recognized in the third quarter of and  in expense recognized in the fourth quarter of the third quarter provision includes the charge off of accounts receivable of facilities included in the impairment and restructuring charges recognized in these accounts receivable were determined to be uncollectible by local and regional operations management personnel who assumed collection responsibilities in the third quarter of in connection with the restructuring of our outpatient regional business offices  which had previously been responsible for collection activities 
the fourth quarter charge reflected management s decision to adopt a more conservative approach in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the revision in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts was due to management s assessment of the healthcare payor environment 
this approach focused more heavily upon the specific agings and payor classifications at each facility  as opposed to determining an estimate based primarily on historical write off rates 
due to a deterioration of the payor environment  our days sales outstanding at the end of the second quarter of had grown to days 
our subsequent reviews uncovered tremendous volumes of denied or pended claims 
further commitment to collecting these older receivables would have diluted our effectiveness in collecting current  ongoing accounts 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for  compared to  for the increase resulted from our investment in additional assets 
interest expense increased to  in  compared to  for  primarily because of the increased amount outstanding under our credit facilities see liquidity and capital resources 
for  interest income was  compared to  for during the fourth quarter of  we completed our budgets for the fiscal year 
the existence of locations budgeting operating losses before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization initiated our need for a detail oriented impairment review 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non recurring expense item of  related to the impairment of long term assets 
the charge was based on a facility by facility review of each facility s financial performance which determined if there were trends that would indicate that the facility s ability to recover its investment in long lived assets had been impaired 
the evaluation indicated that the value of the asset would not be recoverable  as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity over the remaining amortization period  and the impairment loss was calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value

net accounts receivable were  at december   compared to  at december  the number of days of average quarterly revenues in ending receivables was at december   compared to at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the concentration of net accounts receivable from patients  third party payors  insurance companies and others at december  and we have a  revolving credit facility with bank of america  na bank of america and other participating banks the credit agreement 
interest on the credit agreement is paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin  a base rate  or competitively bid rates from the participating banks 
we are required to pay a fee based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined credit ratings 
the principal amount is payable in full on june  we have provided a negative pledge on all assets under the credit agreement 
the effective interest rate on the average outstanding balance under the credit agreement was for the twelve months ended december   compared to the average prime rate of during the same period 
at december   we had drawn  under the credit agreement 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also had a short term credit agreement with bank of america as amended  the short term credit agreement  providing for a  short term revolving credit facility 
the terms of the short term credit agreement were substantially consistent with those of the credit agreement 
interest on the short term credit agreement was paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin or a base rate 
we were required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined ratios 
on october   we terminated the short term credit agreement and replaced it with a new  credit agreement the credit agreement with ubs ag and other participating banks 
interest on the credit agreement is paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin or base rate 
we are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined ratios 
the principal amount is payable in full in eight quarterly installments ending on june  at december   we had no drawings outstanding under the credit agreement 
on march   we issued  principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
we redeemed the notes at par on october  on march   we issued  in convertible subordinated debentures due an additional  principal amount of the convertible debentures was issued on march  to cover underwriters overallotments 
interest is payable on april and october the convertible debentures are convertible into healthsouth common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of a a subdivision  combination or reclassification of outstanding shares of our common stock  b the payment of a stock dividend or stock distribution on any shares of our capital stock  c the issuance of rights or warrants to all holders of our common stock entitling them to purchase shares of our common stock at less than the current market price  or d the payment of certain other distributions with respect to our common stock 
in addition  we may  from time to time  lower the conversion price for periods of not less than days  in our discretion 
we used net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
on june   we issued  in senior notes due and  in senior notes due collectively  the senior notes 
interest is payable on june and december the senior notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of healthsouth 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
on september   we issued  in senior subordinated notes due the notes 
interest is payable on april and october the notes are senior subordinated obligations of healthsouth and  as such  are subordinated to all our existing and future senior indebtedness  and also are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries and partnerships 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to redeem the notes and to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
the notes mature on october  on february   we issued  in senior notes due the notes 
interest is payable on february and august the notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of healthsouth 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities 
the notes mature on february  we intend to pursue the acquisition or development of additional healthcare operations  including outpatient rehabilitation facilities  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  ambulatory surgery centers  outpatient diagnostic centers and companies engaged in the provision of other complementary services  and to expand certain of our existing facilities 
while it is not possible to estimate precisely the amounts which will actually be expended in the foregoing areas  we anticipate that over the next twelve months  we will spend approximately  to  on maintenance and expansion of our existing facilities and approximately  to  on development activities and on continued development of the integrated service model 
see item  business company strategy 
although we are continually considering and evaluating acquisitions and opportunities for future growth  we have not entered into any agreements with respect to material future acquisitions 
we believe that existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements for the next twelve months  and for the reasonably foreseeable future 
inflation in recent years has not had a significant effect on our business  and is not expected to adversely affect us in the future unless it increases significantly 
exposures to market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the impact on earnings and value of market risk sensitive financial instruments principally marketable security investments and long term debt  as well as the interest rate swaps described below is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
we use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate these impacts 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
our investment in marketable securities was  at december   compared to  at december  the investment represents less than of total assets at december  and these securities are generally short term  highly liquid instruments and  accordingly  their fair value approximates cost 
earnings on investments in marketable securities are not significant to our results of operations  and therefore any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on future pre tax earnings 
as described below  a significant portion of our long term indebtedness is subject to variable rates of interest  generally equal to libor plus a predetermined percentage 
in october  we entered into three short term interest rate swap arrangements intended to hedge our exposure to rising interest rates in the capital markets 
two of these arrangements have a notional amount of  and one has a notional amount of  these mature six months and twelve months  respectively  from the date of the original transaction 
the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent an amount of exposure to credit loss 
in each of these arrangements  we pay the counterparty a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount  and the counterparty pays us a variable rate of interest equal to the day libor rate 
the variable rate paid to us by the counterparty on the six month maturities and the twelve month maturity are reset once and three times  respectively  during the term of the swaps 
thus  these interest rate swaps have the effect of fixing the interest rates on an aggregate of  of our variable rate debt through their maturity dates 
the arrangements mature at various dates in april and november we would be exposed to credit losses if the counterparties did not perform their obligations under the swap arrangements  however  the counterparties are major commercial banks whom we believe to be creditworthy  and we expect them to fully satisfy their obligations 
at december   the weighted average interest rate we were obligated to pay under these interest rate swaps was  and the weighted average interest rate we received was 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities  approximately  in long term debt at december  is subject to variable rates of interest before giving effect to the interest rate swaps above  while the remaining balance in long term debt of  is subject to fixed rates of interest 
this compares to  in long term debt subject to variable rates of interest and  in long term debt subject to fixed rates of interest at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further description 
the fair value of our total long term debt  based on discounted cash flow analyses  approximates its carrying value at december  except for the convertible debentures  senior notes  senior notes and senior notes 
the fair value of the convertible debentures at december  was approximately  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential losses in future pre tax earnings would be approximately  the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currency  are currently insignificant to our results of operations and financial position
