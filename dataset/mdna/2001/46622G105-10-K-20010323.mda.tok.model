item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading developer and manufacturer of fibre channel hardware and software products that form critical elements of sans 
we offer a broad line of host bus adapters  asics and software that provide high bandwidth for data communication  high speed data transmission without degradation over distances of up to ten kilometers  guaranteed data delivery and scalability to large numbers of network connections 
we commenced volume production of host bus adapters in  and we are currently the leading independent supplier of host bus adapters for the sun solaris operating system 
in late  we obtained our initial certification from an oem customer for our host bus adapters for the pci interface  and in we introduced a much lower cost host bus adapter for the pci interface based on fibre channel products and technology acquired from adaptec 
we first achieved operating income in the quarter ended september  we completed our initial public offering in october we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment except for sales to distributor customers that have contractual rights of return 
revenue from sales to distributors that have contractual rights of return is recognized when these distributors ship our products to their end user customers 
allowances for estimated sales returns are provided at the time revenue is recognized 
we reserve for uncollectable accounts and warranty claims based on past history and expected future returns related to products shipped 
cost of revenues is comprised principally of payments to our contract manufacturers  costs of components  material expediting charges  final assembly costs  manufacturing and quality related costs  inventory management costs and support costs 
we expect our gross margin to be affected by many factors  including changes in average unit selling price  fluctuations in demand for our products  the mix of products sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  the timing and size of customer orders  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  changes in costs of components  inventory write offs  and new product introductions both by us and our competitors 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  depreciation of development and test equipment  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our products and the cost of computer support services 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  public relations  advertising  promotional and trade show costs and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in finance  human resources  information technology  administrative activities and legal and accounting fees 
amortization of intangible assets arises from the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchase of products and technology from adaptec in november for  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
as a result of the consideration paid to adaptec  we recorded million in intangible assets related to the core technology acquired which is being amortized over an estimated useful life of three years 
amortization of stock based compensation relates to deferred compensation recorded in connection with the grant of stock options to employees in all operating expense categories where the option exercise price is less than the fair value of the underlying shares of common stock as determined for financial reporting purposes 
we have recorded deferred compensation within stockholders equity of approximately million which is being amortized over the vesting period of the related stock options  generally four years 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was due to an increase in sales of sbus and pci host bus adapter products with a million increase in sbus sales and a million increase in pci sales  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our asics 
the increase in revenues reflects the increased demand for our products and the continued growth in the market for fibre channel products 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of net revenues in compared to of net revenues in gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the decrease was due to increased sales of our pci host bus adapter products which generally have lower gross margins than our sbus host bus adapter products 
gross margins for the year ended december  also decreased as a result of inventory reserves recorded for slow moving and obsolete inventory and higher prices on certain components due to industry wide shortages 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to higher personnel costs and contracted services  resulting from an increase in the number of personnel needed in order to staff a higher level of research and development  and higher depreciation expense  resulting from an increase in capital expenditures necessary to expand our research and development efforts 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues

we recognized an income tax provision of million  with an effective tax rate of  during the year ended december  as a result of the taxable income generated in the year ended december  the difference between our effective tax rate of and the statutory tax rate is primarily a result of research and development tax credits generated 
we recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to the expectation that deductions from future employee stock option exercises and related deductions will exceed future taxable income 
we recognized an income tax benefit of  in the year ended december  due primarily to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was released during the second quarter of based on management s determination at the time that our ability to realize such a benefit was more likely than not 
this determination was based on our historical operating results  which included the fourth consecutive quarter of pre tax net income before non deductible stock based compensation  and anticipated future operating results 
excluding the effect for the release of the valuation allowance  the tax rate for would have been approximately

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
this statement will be effective for jni on january  sfas requires certain accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas  all derivatives must be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair value 
we do not currently use derivative instruments and therefore do not expect the adoption of this new accounting standard will have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to changes in the fair market value of our investments and the amount of interest income earned on our investment portfolio 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair market value of our investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december
