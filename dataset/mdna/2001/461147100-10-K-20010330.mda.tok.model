item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new or expanding existing semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this cyclicality has been clearly demonstrated during the past five years  with downward cycles in and  and up cycles in  and during the fourth quarter of  demand for ate entered another cyclical downturn 
we cannot be sure as to the length and depth of this current downturn and when the next cyclical growth phase will occur 
in response to this downturn  we reduced our worldwide workforce by  or people  during the first quarter of in addition  we have implemented a worldwide salary freeze  put a hold on new hires and implemented additional cost controls on other expenditures with the goal of reducing our overall operating expenditures by 
we sell our products to both semiconductor manufacturers end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
historically  the majority of our manipulator  docking hardware and tester interface product sales have been directly to semiconductor manufacturers  with our end user sales typically in the range of to of our net revenues 
in the past year  many semiconductor manufacturers have begun to show a preference for purchasing the various components of the ate excluding temperature management systems they need from a single source 
typically  this source is the manufacturer of the largest and most expensive components of the ate system  the tester manufacturer 
during  oem sales as a percentage of net revenues increased from to for manipulator and docking hardware products and from to for tester interface products and we expect that oem sales as a percentage of net revenues will continue to increase in the future for these product segments 
the impact of this increase in oem sales as a percentage of net revenues is a reduction in our gross margin  as oem sales have a more significant discount than end user sales 
our current net operating margins on oem sales for these product segments  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we also expect to continue to experience demands from our oem customers supply line management groups to reduce our sales prices to them 
this continued price pressure may have the ultimate effect of reducing our gross and operating margins if we cannot reduce our manufacturing and operating costs 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from the end users capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of our products for the purpose of upgrading  or to improve the utilization  performance and efficiency of  existing ate tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of temperature management products results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in a handler 
we believe that this business is less cyclical than new ate sales 
please refer to the section entitled risks that could affect future results below for a further discussion of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
significant events on march   we acquired temptronic corporation 
the acquisition was in the form of a merger of temptronic into a subsidiary of ours  and was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
temptronic designs  makes  sells and services high performance temperature management systems used in the testing of ics and other electronic products 
these temperature management systems are complementary to the manipulator  docking hardware and tester interface products manufactured by us prior to the merger and expand our line of product offerings to our customer base 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of testdesign corporation  a privately held california corporation 
testdesign is engaged in the design and manufacture of tester interface products used by the semiconductor industry 
the purchase price was million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
subsequent to the acquisition  testdesign was renamed intest sunnyvale corporation 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of such business 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we believe that the significant increase in net revenues over the comparable prior period is principally the result of growth in the demand for ate that continued through most of as compared to gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of increased material costs coupled with higher levels of fixed manufacturing costs and  to a lesser extent  for manipulator and docking hardware products as well as tester interface products  an increase in the percentage of oem sales in compared to the increase in material costs was mainly the result of significant additions to our obsolescence reserve and  to a lesser extent  higher costs to purchase certain component materials  such as aluminum  as well as increases in fabrication costs 
the additions to our obsolescence reserve were made against certain recently discontinued product lines  as well as other products where we do not see significant future demand relative to current inventory levels 
we believe the increase in fabrication costs is the result of higher demand for fabrication in most of the markets where we operate 
the increase in fixed manufacturing costs is primarily the result of increased levels of salary expense due to additional operations staff hired in late and in response to increased business activity as well as salary increases for existing staff  combined with higher facility and depreciation costs primarily resulting from the relocation of certain of our manufacturing facilities in the us in order to significantly increase our manufacturing capacity 
we believe this increased capacity coupled with additional expansions planned for will enable us to meet the demand for our products in the foreseeable future 
the decline in gross margin was partially offset by the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs over significantly higher net revenue levels in compared to selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased commission expense related to the higher sales levels in  as well as higher levels of salary and benefits expense for new and existing staff 
to a lesser extent  higher levels of warranty expense  travel costs  freight and advertising expenditures also contributed to the increase in selling expense 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to the salary and benefits expense of additional engineering and technical staff and  to a lesser extent  increased spending on product development materials and fees for technical consultants associated with new product development 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increases in incentive compensation for existing staff and  to a lesser extent  increases in professional fees and travel costs 
these increases were partially offset by the receipt of  in settlement of patent infringement litigation  which was recorded as a reduction of legal expense 
merger related costs 
merger related costs resulting from our merger with temptronic corporation were million  which consisted primarily of fees paid to investment bankers  professional fees  printing  escrow and other miscellaneous costs 
write off of deferred offering costs 
during september  we withdrew our registration statement for the offering of million shares of our common stock  million of which were to be offered by us and million by certain of our stockholders 
approximately  of costs related to the withdrawn offering  which consisted primarily of professional fees  printing costs and roadshow costs  were expensed during the third quarter of other income expense 
other income expense was  for compared to  for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase to the reduction in interest expense resulting from debt retirements early in  combined with an increase in interest income in from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents in compared to and an increase in other miscellaneous income 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for from million for our effective tax rate for was compared to for the significant increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to million of non tax deductible merger related costs incurred in  which significantly increased the effective tax rate  combined with a million reduction in the valuation allowance in  which significantly reduced the effective tax rate 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was based on management s assessment of our ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the significant increase in net revenues over the comparable prior period results from the turnaround in the demand for ate in previously described 
net revenues for  excluding the net revenues of intest sunnyvale  formerly testdesign corporation  which was acquired on august   increased million or over gross margin 
gross margin increased to for from in the improvement in gross margin resulted primarily from the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs over significantly higher net revenue levels in compared to also contributing to the improvement in the gross margin were production methodology improvements implemented in by temptronic  which were offset  in part  by increases in fixed manufacturing costs  resulting from manufacturing capacity increases in and the acquisition of intest sunnyvale 
during the third quarter of  we added a machining operation in cherry hill  new jersey and commenced manufacturing operations in singapore 
both of these additions had a negative impact on our gross margin because these operations were not fully functional until late in the fourth quarter of selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase to several factors  including the salary expense of new sales and marketing staff  as well as salary increases for existing staff  increased expenditures for travel  higher levels of both warranty and freight costs and increased spending on advertising 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to the additional salary expense of the intest sunnyvale engineering and technical staff 
to a lesser extent  increased costs of materials used in product development and travel expenses to facilitate collaboration among our several offices contributed to the overall increases in this expense category 
offsetting these increases were reductions in spending on third party product development consultants and reductions in engineering and technical staff by temptronic 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increases in administrative salary expense due to staffing additions  including the staff of intest sunnyvale  and salary and incentive compensation increases for existing staff  legal costs related to our patent infringement suit and for the filing of new patents and maintenance on existing patents worldwide  settlement costs of threatened litigation relating to a temptronic personnel matter that occurred prior to our acquisition of temptronic  and amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of intest sunnyvale 
other income expense 
other income expense was  for compared to  for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase to the reduction in interest expense resulting from debt retirements during  which were partially offset by reduced interest income in from lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents in compared to income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for from million for  an increase of  our effective tax rate was for compared to for the significant decline in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the million reduction in the valuation allowance in the valuation allowance was reduced based on management s assessment of our ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the rate was negatively affected by the nonrecognition of a current tax benefit on a portion of temptronic s operating loss 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million 
accounts receivable increased million from december  to december  due to the increase in sales activity throughout inventories increased million  also as a result of the increased sales activity as we made purchases for future product shipments 
other current assets decreased  primarily as a result of the expensing of previously capitalized merger related costs 
accounts payable decreased  due to the timing of payments to vendors 
accrued expenses increased  primarily as a result of additional accruals for salaries  incentive compensation  sales commissions  merger related costs and warranty expense 
domestic and foreign income taxes payable decreased million as a result of significant estimated tax payments made during the fourth quarter of purchases of machinery and equipment were million for the year ended december   which consisted primarily of improvements to our domestic facilities 
during this period we spent approximately  on equipment   on leasehold improvements and  on furnishings at our new facility for our intest sunnyvale operation  which relocated during the first quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we relocated our headquarters and primary manufacturing facility and spent approximately million on leasehold improvements   on equipment  and  on furnishings 
we plan to relocate our uk manufacturing facility during the first quarter of  and we estimate the total cost of leasehold improvements and other costs associated with the move will be approximately  we plan to keep our existing uk manufacturing facility and convert it into a machine shop during the second quarter of to support the fabrication needs of our uk manufacturing operation 
we estimate the cost to convert the existing facility and purchase the equipment to be approximately  we plan to relocate our singapore manufacturing facility during the second quarter of and we estimate the total cost of leasehold improvements and other costs associated with the move will be approximately  we plan to relocate our temptronic subsidiary during the second quarter of  and we estimate that the total cost of leasehold improvements and other costs associated with the move will be approximately million 
in addition we spent approximately  on manufacturing and computer equipment at various other domestic operations during the year  including approximately  for demonstration equipment related to a recently redesigned product for our temptronic subsidiary and  as a deposit on an additional coordinate measuring machine for our cherry hill location 
we expect delivery and final payment for this equipment of approximately  to occur in the first quarter of other long term assets decreased  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the liquidation of life insurance policies held on certain former temptronic officers and directors 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
during this period  we repaid approximately million under revolving lines of credit as well as  of long term debt acquired as a result of the merger with temptronic 
during the same period we received  from the exercise of stock options held by employees 
as of december   we had a million committed  unsecured line of credit 
this line of credit is due to expire june  based upon our projected operating results for  coupled with our historic results of operations  we believe that this line of credit will be renewed in by the bank which granted it 
this facility has been renewed each year since the original credit agreement was signed in we believe that our existing cash balances and line of credit plus the anticipated net cash provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  future acquisitions may require additional equity or debt financing to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
under the terms of our current credit agreement  any payment of dividends would require the prior consent of the lender 
risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
these factors may also cause our future results to differ materially from our prior results 
our forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  intends  may  will  should or anticipates or similar terminology  and include  but are not limited to  statements made in this report regarding developments and trends in the ic and ate industries  future acquisitions  costs and timing of completion and integration of our acquisitions  our cost containment initiatives  the development of new products and technologies by us or our competitors  the availability of materials used to manufacture our products  the availability of qualified personnel  the costs associated with the expansion of facilities  general economic conditions  net revenues generated by foreign subsidiaries  exchange rate fluctuations and the use of forward exchange rate contracts  merger related costs  the increasing use of front end testing by semiconductor manufacturers  cost overruns incurred in the expansion and relocation of our operations  stock price fluctuations  the anticipated market for our products  and the sufficiency of cash balances  lines of credit and net cash from operations 
our sales reflect the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
capital expenditures by these companies depend upon  among other things  the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them 
typically  semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downtown 
conversely  semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products 
these market changes have caused in the past  and will likely cause in the future  our operating results to fluctuate 
the current cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry has slowed demand for our products 
our sales and operating results will likely be reduced during this downturn 
our operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
during the last three years  our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
we believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
in addition to the changing cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry  other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past  or that may cause fluctuations or losses in the future  include competitive pricing pressures  delays in shipments of our products  the mix of our products sold  the mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products  changes in our fixed costs  costs associated with the development of our proprietary technology  costs and timing of completion and integration of our acquisitions  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support our new business  our ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed  and cancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers 
because the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on  and in relation to  changes in our operating results  fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue 
if we are not able to control our operating expenses during a cyclical downturn  our operating margins will be reduced 
due to the current cyclical downturn  we have implemented cost containment strategies with a goal of reducing our operating expenses by 
these strategies include workforce reductions at all of our domestic manufacturing facilities  a worldwide salary freeze  a hold on all new hires and additional cost controls on other expenditures 
we may not be successful in reaching our goal of reducing our operating expenses by and  if we are not able to control our operating expenses  they could increase and our operating margins will be reduced 
we intend to acquire additional businesses 
if we are unable to do so  our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited 
a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses  technologies or products that expand and complement our current businesses 
we may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy if we are unable to identify suitable businesses or technologies to acquire  we do not have access to required capital at the necessary time  or we are unwilling or unable to outbid larger  more resourceful companies 
our acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
if we acquire additional businesses  technologies or products  we will face the following additional risks future acquisitions could divert management s attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management  operational and financial resources  we might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably  we may realize substantial acquisition related expenses  including the amortization of goodwill  which would reduce our net earnings in future years  and our investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire 
if any of the events described above occur  our earnings could be reduced 
if we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions  we would dilute our existing stockholders interests and our earnings per share may decrease 
if we issue debt in connection with any future acquisitions  lenders may impose covenants on use which could  among other things  restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses 
our industry is subject to rapidly evolving technological change  and our business prospects would be hurt if we are unable to respond to innovation in the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ics into an increasing variety of products 
this trend  and the rapid changes needed in automatic testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor industry  are likely to continue 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing  manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or attain market acceptance 
our failure to provide products that meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will hurt our business prospects 
if we are not able to obtain patents on or otherwise preserve and protect our proprietary technologies  our business may suffer 
we have obtained domestic and foreign patents covering some of our products which expire between the years and  and we have pending applications for additional patents 
some of our products utilize proprietary technology that is not covered by patent or similar protection  and in many cases  cannot be protected 
we cannot be certain that any additional patents will be issued on our applications  any patents we own now or in the future will protect our business against competitors that develop similar technology or products  our patents will be held valid if they are challenged or subjected to reexamination or reissue  others will not claim rights to our patented or other proprietary technologies  or others will not develop technologies which are similar to  or can compete with  our unpatented proprietary technologies 
if we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary technologies  our ability to compete in our markets could be impaired 
claims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses 
from time to time  we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  may consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may be costly to us 
if we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms  our business could suffer 
in instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others  or that someone may be infringing our patent rights  we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question  as well as the potentially infringing conduct 
if we become involved in a dispute  neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel s conclusions 
our business will suffer if we cannot compete successfully with manufacturers whose products are similar to ours 
we compete with numerous manufacturers  many of whom have greater financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities that we do 
some of our principal competitors in the sale of manipulator  docking and tester interface products are reid ashman manufacturing  microhandling gmbh  credence systems  ltx  schlumberger  teradyne and cerprobe 
some of our principal competitors in the sale of temperature management products are trio tech international  thermonics and ers elektronik gmbh 
in order to remain competitive with these and other companies  we must be able to continue to commit a significant portion of our personnel  financial resources  research and development and customer support to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
if we are not able to compete successfully  our business will suffer 
we generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers 
if we were to lose one or more of our large customers  operating results could suffer dramatically 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net revenues in  although no one customer accounted for or more of our net revenues in the loss of any one or more of our largest customers  or a reduction in orders by a major customer  could materially reduce our net revenues 
if we do not continue to retain the services of key personnel  relationships with  and sales to  some of our customers could suffer 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively 
our future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and certain other key employees 
generally  we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key employees  although we entered into an employment agreement with the president and chief executive officer of temptronic in connection with our merger with temptronic 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to retain our managers  engineers and other key employees 
our business could suffer if we were unable to retain one or more of our senior officers or other key employees 
a substantial portion of our operations exists outside the us  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
we have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations as necessary to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non us customers 
our foreign subsidiaries generated of consolidated net revenues in both and export sales from our us manufacturing facilities totaled million  or of consolidated net revenues in and million  or in the portion of our consolidated net revenues that were derived from sales to the asia pacific region were in  in and in countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  have experienced economic instability resulting in weaknesses in their currency  banking and equity markets 
although the economic instability in the asia pacific region has not had a material adverse effect on our order backlog  financial condition  or results of operations to date  continued economic instability could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and our results of operations 
we expect our international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues 
to date  we have not experienced significant problems in our foreign operations 
however  in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the us  sales to customers outside the us and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks  which may  in the future  affect our operations 
these risks include political and economic instability in foreign countries  the imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments  the need to comply with a wide variety of us and foreign import and export laws  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and the greater difficulty of administering business abroad 
we conduct business in foreign currencies  and fluctuations in the values of those currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
in  approximately of our net revenues were dominated in japanese yen  approximately were dominated in british pounds  and less than were dominated in german deutsche marks our operation in germany commenced in august 
fluctuations in the values of these currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
any strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the currencies of our competitors or customers  or strengthening or weakening of the japanese yen  british pound or german deutsche mark or the euro beginning in in relation to other currencies in which our customers or competitors do business  could adversely affect our competitiveness 
moreover  a strengthening of the us dollar or other competitive factors could put pressure on us to denominate a greater portion of our sales in foreign currencies  thereby increasing our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
any devaluation of these currencies would hurt our business 
we do not undertake hedging activities against all of our exchange rate risk 
fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our competitive position or result in foreign exchange losses  either of which could cause our business to suffer 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk in the normal course of our business  primarily in our japanese operations 
our exposure results from the fact that the sales of our japanese subsidiary are in japanese yen and inventory purchases are in us dollars 
we have the same exposure in our german operations which commenced in august as a portion of total sales are in german deutsche marks while inventory purchases are in us dollars 
we will also have a similar exposure in our singapore operations as our manufacturing operations expand  because our sales are in us dollars but some of our manufacturing costs are in british pounds and singapore dollars 
we employ risk management strategies  including the use of forward exchange rate contracts  to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the yen  and may  in the future  use forward exchange rate contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the singapore dollar and german deutsche mark 
our objective in managing currency exchange risk is to minimize the impact of significant currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we use forward exchange rate contracts to establish a fixed conversion rate between the japanese yen and the us dollar so that the level of our gross margin from sales in japan is not negatively affected by significant movements in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
we purchase forward exchange rate contracts on a monthly basis in the amounts management deems appropriate in light of the amount of the us dollar denominated obligations of our japanese subsidiary that are due within the month 
we do not purchase forward contracts with settlement dates beyond days 
as of december   there were no forward exchange rate contracts outstanding 
it is our policy to enter into forward exchange rate contracts only to the extent necessary to achieve the desired objectives of management in limiting our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we do not hedge all of our currency exchange rate risk exposures in a manner that would completely eliminate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our net earnings 
we do not expect that the results of our operations or our liquidity will be materially affected by these risk management activities
