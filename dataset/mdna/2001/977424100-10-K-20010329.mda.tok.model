the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of business driven multimedia recording  analysis and electronic learning software that enables companies to enhance their customer interactions across multiple communications media 
our software is designed to enable customer contact centers within a company to record and evaluate complete customer interactions through one or more communications media  such as telephone and web chat  and then apply targeted electronic learning for continuous performance improvement 
we believe that the key benefits of our products include increased revenues from improved customer interactions  improved profitability from increased customer service representative and supervisor productivity and reduced turnover and enhanced customer retention through greater customer intimacy 
our software is designed to integrate with a variety of third party software  such as customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning applications  and with existing telephony and computer network hardware and software 
the majority of our customers are companies with one or more contact centers that handle voice and data customer interactions for outbound sales and marketing operations  inbound service support lines  or both 
we primarily utilize a direct sales organization and a variety of strategic marketing alliances to reach our target customer base 
sources of revenues and revenue recognition policy we derive our revenues from licensing software and providing related services 
revenue is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on their relative fair values  which is established by the price charged when the respective element is sold separately 
license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
software services include installation  training and maintenance 
revenues from installation and training are recognized upon performance of the related services 
installation and training services are offered and billed as separate elements of contracts on a time and material basis 
the functionality of the software is not dependent on installation and training services 
maintenance is offered as a separate element and includes the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract  usually one year 
specified upgrades are not typically offered to customers 
historically  all customers have purchased an initial maintenance contract for each newly licensed site 
during and  of our customers renewed their annual maintenance contracts 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of revenues were derived from sales within north america 
prior to  substantially all of our revenues were derived from sales within north america 
we expect that a greater proportion of future license and professional services revenues will be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
our license agreements generally provide that customers pay a software license fee for one or more software products for a specified number of users 
the amount of the license fee varies based on which software product is licensed  the number of software products licensed and the number of users licensed 
customers can subsequently pay additional license fees to allow additional users to use previously licensed software products or to license additional software products 
each software product contains common components  allowing for easy integration of additional software products as they are licensed from us 
customers that license software products usually receive the software on compact disc 
until the first quarter of  we also generated revenues from the sale of computer hardware 
this hardware consisted of standard  readily available computer servers that we purchased from third parties and resold 
because of the relatively low volume of hardware sales compared to traditional computer equipment providers  we were unable to compete on price with those providers and frequently resorted to selling hardware at very low margins or below cost 
the losses that we incurred from selling hardware adversely affected our liquidity and financial position 
because of this  we discontinued hardware sales in the first quarter of  which improved gross margins during our customers currently purchase their hardware from other suppliers 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of license revenues primarily consists of royalties due to third parties and packaging costs 
cost of services revenues includes salaries and related expenses for installation  training and maintenance personnel and allocations of facilities  communications and depreciation expenses 
cost of hardware revenues consisted of purchases of hardware 
we discontinued sales of hardware during the first quarter of operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
we allocate the costs for overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use the overhead and facilities services 
these allocated charges include rent for corporate offices  communication charges and depreciation expenses for office furniture and equipment 
we anticipate that operating expenses will increase substantially as we increase sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund greater levels of research and development  broaden professional services and support  improve operational and financial systems and support our growth internationally 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
to date  software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established have not been material 
we had full time employees at december   up from and  at december  and  respectively 
this rapid growth of our workforce places a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  it is necessary for us to implement and improve operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
in addition  we expect that future expansion will continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
competition is intense for highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
if total revenue does not increase relative to operating expenses  and management systems do not expand to meet increasing demands  and if we fail to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel or our management otherwise fails to manage our expansion effectively  there would be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
results of operations the table below shows operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  statement of operations data revenues license services hardware total revenues cost of revenues license services hardware total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative charge for termination of distribution agreement acquired in process research and development operating loss interest income expense  net loss before provision for income taxes and extraordinary loss provision for income taxes loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss net loss revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in and from million in the increases were attributable to increases in our customer base  which grew to sites at the end of from at the end of and at the end of total revenues grew from to although we expect revenues to grow on an annual basis  we do not expect to maintain this same rate of revenue growth year over year 
license revenues increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in license revenues were due to increases in our customer base  the number of software applications we are offering  and our average selling prices  resulting from a growing market awareness of our products and  to a lesser extent  an expanded sales force 
further  during  and   and  respectively  of license revenues were attributable to new customers compared to follow on revenues from our existing customer base 
services revenues increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
installation and training revenues grew primarily due to the increase in software licenses to new customer sites 
maintenance revenues increased due to new customer sites and renewals of annual maintenance contracts from existing customer sites 
services revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased due to the compounding effect of maintenance revenue from both new customer sites and renewals of maintenance contracts from existing customer sites 
we discontinued the sale of hardware during the first quarter of as a result  hardware revenues decreased to  in from million in cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in  representing and of total revenues  respectively 
total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased in from due to the discontinuance of hardware sales in the first quarter of total cost of revenues decreased in from million in  or of total revenues primarily due to the discontinuance of hardware sales 
over time we expect that service revenues as a percentage of total revenues will grow due to the compounding effect of maintenance revenue from existing customers as they renew their annual contracts 
we expect that as this happens  our gross margins will decline slightly 
cost of license revenues increased to  in from  in and from  in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in absolute dollars were due to increased royalties for third party software resulting from increased license revenues 
during  we released new products and enhanced some of our existing products  both of which contain additional third party software components 
as we license more of these products in the future  and incur royalties for these third party products  we expect that the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase  as will the absolute dollars 
cost of services revenues increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in absolute dollars were a result of increases in the number of employees engaged in installation  training and customer maintenance services 
cost of services revenues as a percentage of services revenues was in  in and in the improvement in the service margins in was due to fewer employees engaged in maintenance services per customer 
the improvement in in the services margin was primarily due to improved project management for installation services and  to a lesser extent  fewer employees engaged in maintenance services per customer 
as we license software to more new customers  we expect to continue to hire additional service personnel and anticipate that cost of services revenues will increase 
we discontinued the sale of hardware during the first quarter of as a result  hardware cost of revenues decreased to  in from million in operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in sales personnel  advertising and  to a lesser extent  an increase in marketing program expenses 
we expect that the absolute dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase due to the planned growth of our sales force  including the establishment of additional sales offices both domestically and internationally in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
we also expect additional increases in advertising and marketing programs and other promotional activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing and of total revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and consultants engaged in research and development activities 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to commit substantial resources to enhancing existing product functionality and to developing new products 
furthermore  we may incur additional research and development charges associated with purchased technology for further information see liquidity and capital resources 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and related expenses in the executive  finance and administrative functions to manage the growth of our company 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add infrastructure to support a larger organization and continue to invest in our international expansion 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to relocate our corporate headquarters to a larger facility within the atlanta metropolitan area 
during july  we executed a lease agreement for the new facility 
we estimated that costs associated with subletting our existing facilities  which are under noncancellable leases expiring on september   would be approximately  we recorded this obligation in the second quarter of and allocated such costs to each departmental functional area of the organization 
as of december   there had been no changes to the plan 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred a deferred stock compensation charge of million for the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock option grants 
this charge is being amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
deferred stock compensation was  and  in and  respectively 
for and   and  were included in cost of services   and  in sales and marketing   and  in research and development  and  and  in general and administrative  respectively 
in addition  we incurred other personnel costs of  during  relating to severance payments for terminated executives as well as a bonus and relocation costs in connection with recruiting a new executive 
such costs were allocated so that  was included in research and development and  in general and administrative 
during  we incurred a  charge to terminate a distributor agreement 
acquired in process research and development 
during  we acquired technology to store and retrieve substantially larger volumes of data than our existing software was currently capable of storing and retrieving in exchange for shares of our common stock valued at million 
the purchase price was accounted for as acquired in process research and development expense because  at the date of the transaction  the in process research and development acquired by us related to the development of technology not possessed by us and the results of this in process research and development had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net increased to million in from  in due to the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering ipo 
interest income expense  net increased in from  in due to an increase in borrowings under the then existing credit facilities 
provision for income taxes no provision for federal  state or foreign income taxes has been recorded as we incurred net operating losses or utilized new operating loss carryforwards for all periods presented 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated as a result of these net operating loss carryforwards  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently considered more likely than not 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as the percentage of total revenues represented by each item 
the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider to be necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

license and services revenues as percentages of total revenues held constant throughout we expect the relative amount of license revenues as compared to services revenues to be consistent with we discontinued the sale of hardware during the first quarter of our quarterly revenues increased throughout and primarily as a result of a growing market awareness of our products and  to a lesser extent  an expanded sales force 
cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues were lower in the fourth quarter of due to the increase in license revenues 
operating expenses increased each quarter primarily as a result of the increase in the number of employees engaged in all areas of our business 
we believe that our quarterly operating results may experience seasonal fluctuations in the future 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on client calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns and compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful  and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources on february   we completed our ipo whereby we issued million shares at an offering price of per share 
simultaneously  our underwriters exercised their over allotment option to issue an additional  shares   shares of which were sold by us 
net proceeds to us were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and selling stockholders net proceeds 
since the ipo  we have repaid all of our long term debt totaling of million  including  in prepayment penalties 
we recorded an extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt of  during due to the write off of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing fees and the payment of the prepayment penalty 
the remaining net proceeds were invested in high grade marketable securities 
the principal use of cash to date has been to fund our losses from operations and to purchase furniture and equipment 
cash used for operating activities was million   and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in cash used in operating activities were due primarily to changes in operating losses and working capital 
investing activities consisted of capital expenditures totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively  used to acquire furniture and equipment and other assets 
we expect to have total capital expenditures of approximately million in we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase over the next several years as we expand our facilities and acquire equipment to support expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities 
as a result of our ipo proceeds  investing activities during included gross purchases of short term investments totaling million and sales and maturities of million 
we intend to use these investments primarily to fund our sales and marketing and research and development expenses  operating deficits and other working capital needs and for general corporate purposes  including the development of our product lines potentially through acquisitions of products  technologies and businesses 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from our ipo 
the increase in was mainly due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of series c convertible preferred stock 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted investments  and million in working capital 
in connection with our new corporate headquarters lease and furniture rental  we executed three letters of credit in the aggregate amount of as security 
in addition  we currently have million of short term investments pledged as collateral for the letters of credit 
the letters of credit and related restricted investments have decreasing schedules and expire in and during  we entered into an option agreement to purchase technology for research and development activities 
if the option  which expires on march   is exercised  we will pay million to purchase the technology 
as of december   the option s carrying value was  and classified as an other asset 
if we choose to exercise the option  we may be required to record a million charge in the period exercised depending upon technological feasibility and alternative future uses at the time of exercise 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by any cash used in operating activities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish new financing arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure that any financing arrangements will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
at december   our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was days 
we expect our days sales outstanding to increase as we receive a greater proportion of our revenues from international operations  where payment is typically slower than in the united states

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term instruments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  sweden  australia  mexico and japan and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has not been material 
we have not conducted transactions  established commitments or entered into relationships requiring disclosures beyond those provided elsewhere in this form k
