foreign operations united generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies 
these expenses include aircraft leases  commissions  catering  personnel expense  advertising and distribution costs  customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through changes in foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
despite the adverse favorable effects a strengthening weakening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic  a strengthening weakening of foreign currencies tends to increase decrease reported revenue and operating income because united s foreign currency denominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency denominated operating expense for each currency 
with a worldwide network and significant sales and marketing efforts in the us as well as every major economic region in the world  united is able to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in any single foreign currency 
the company s biggest net exposures are typically for japanese yen  hong kong dollars  australian dollars  british pounds and the euro 
during  yen denominated operating revenue net of yen denominated operating expense was approximately billion yen approximately million  hong kong dollar denominated operating revenue net of hong kong dollar denominated operating expense was approximately  million hong kong dollars approximately million  british pound denominated operating revenue net of british pound denominated operating expense was approximately million british pounds approximately million  australian dollar denominated operating revenue net of australian dollar denominated operating expense was approximately million australian dollars approximately million  and euro denominated operating revenue net of euro denominated operating expense was approximately million euro approximately million 
to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on united s financial results  the company hedged some of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future foreign currency revenues by purchasing put options consisting of japanese yen  euro  australian dollars and british pounds and selling hong kong dollar forwards 
to reduce hedging costs  the company sells a correlation option in the first four currencies referred to above 
united also attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses by converting excess local currencies generated to us dollars on a timely basis and by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts 
the total notional amount of outstanding currency options and forward exchange contracts  and their respective fair market values as of december   are summarized in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk united s foreign operations involve insignificant amounts of physical assets  however  the company does have sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of atlantic and latin america route authorities 
operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the united states and foreign countries 
changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact the value of united s international route authority 
significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on ual s operating revenues and results of operations 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued an exposure draft  business combinations and intangible assets accounting for goodwill  which could impact the company s accounting for these assets 
for further details  see new accounting pronouncements below 
airport rents and landing fees united is charged facility rental and landing fees at virtually every airport at which it operates 
in recent years  many airports have increased or sought to increase rates charged to airlines as a means of compensating for increasing demands upon airport revenues 
airlines have challenged certain of these increases through litigation and in some cases have not been successful 
the faa and the dot have instituted an administrative hearing process to judge whether rate increases are legal and valid 
however  to the extent the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such charges is restricted  the rates charged by airports may increase substantially 
management cannot predict either the likelihood or the magnitude of any such increase 
environmental and legal contingencies united has been named as a potentially responsible party at certain environmental protection agency epa cleanup sites which have been designated as superfund sites 
united s alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal  however  at sites where the epa has commenced litigation  potential liability is joint and several 
additionally  united has participated and is participating in remediation actions at certain other sites  primarily airports 
the estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it is determined that it is probable that united is liable 
environmental regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change  and determining the actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and remediation experience 
therefore  the ultimate cost cannot be determined at this time 
however  while such cost may vary from united s current estimate  united believes the difference between its accrued reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material 
ual has certain other contingencies resulting from this and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business 
management believes  after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the views of legal counsel  the nature of such contingencies and prior experience  that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect ual s financial condition  operating results or liquidity 
common stock dividends during  ual instituted an annual dividend of per share on ual common stock 
accordingly  ual paid million per share in common dividends in each of the second  third and fourth quarters of in addition  on december  ual s board of directors declared a dividend of per share payable on february  to stockholders of record january  new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the effective date of sfas no 
was delayed one year  to fiscal years beginning after june  the company plans to adopt sfas no 
 which was subsequently amended by sfas no 
 in the first quarter of united has reviewed its various contracts to determine which contracts meet the requirements of sfas no 
 as amended  and need to be reflected as derivatives under the standard and accounted for at fair value 
accordingly  the company will recognize a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of tax  in the first quarter in addition  the company believes the adoption of sfas will increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
on february   the fasb issued an exposure draft business combinations and intangible assets accounting for goodwill 
the exposure draft requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and for separately recognized non goodwill intangible assets that have an indefinite useful economic life 
under this approach  goodwill and certain intangibles would not be amortized  but would be written down and expensed against earnings only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the fair value 
the company has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting the new exposure draft  but it could result in significant changes to the classification and recording of intangibles and amortization expense currently on the books  as well as the accounting for the planned acquisition of us airways 
outlook for the softening of the us economy has had an industry wide effect on business travel  as a result  the company has experienced a decrease in high yield near term bookings 
in addition  passenger revenue performance is expected to be negatively impacted by the reduced capacity level put in place to improve operational reliability 
given these weaker than anticipated revenues  combined with higher labor costs and fuel prices  the company expects first quarter results to be substantially below the current first call consensus of loss per share 
the company had previously provided full year guidance  including the possible effects of its planned acquisition of us airways  based on business plans prepared before the onset of the revenue deterioration 
with the weakening of the us economic situation  the company has taken steps to reduce planned spending by million 
however  based on expectations that revenue weakness will continue  the company now expects performance to be below plan levels for the full year 
the uncertainty surrounding key factors affecting the company s financial performance  such as the breadth and length of the us economic slowdown  the outcome of the planned united and us airways merger and the outcome of labor negotiations and the cost of fuel  among other factors  precludes the company from providing any specific estimates on results at this time 
information included in the above outlook section  as well as certain statements made throughout the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are identified by an asterisk is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
forward looking statements represent the company s expectations and beliefs concerning future events  based on information available to the company as of the date of this filing 
some factors that could significantly impact revenues  expenses  unit costs  and the results and benefits of the pending merger between united and us airways include  without limitation  the airline pricing environment  industry capacity decisions  competitors route decisions  obtaining regulatory approvals for the united and us airways merger  successfully integrating the businesses of united and us airways  costs related to the united and us airways merger  achieving cost cutting synergies resulting from the united and us airways merger  labor integration issues  the ultimate outcome of existing litigation  the success of the company s cost control efforts  the cost of crude oil and jet fuel  the results of union contract negotiations and their impact on labor costs  operational disruptions as a result of bad weather  air traffic control related difficulties and labor issues  the growth of e commerce and off tariff distribution channels  the effective deployment of customer service tools and resources  actions of the us  foreign and local governments  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the economic environment of the airline industry and the economic environment in general 
investors should not place undue reliance on the forward looking information contained herein  which speaks only as of the date of this filing 
ual disclaims any intent or obligation to update or alter any of the forward looking statements whether in response to new information  unforeseen events  changed circumstances or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk united s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations and short term investments 
united does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments portfolio 
united s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements  depending upon market conditions 
a portion of the borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies which exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates 
to hedge against some of this risk  the company has placed foreign currency deposits primarily for japanese yen  french francs  german marks and euros to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies 
since unrealized mark to market gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations  the company reduces its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility 
the fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate 
the fair value of long term debt is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows using a us treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument  adjusted by a credit spread

price risk aircraft fuel when market conditions indicate risk reduction is achievable  united enters into fuel option contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel 
the option contracts are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel 
based on current market conditions  united does not believe risk reduction is achievable and is no longer entering into new option contracts

in addition  to a limited extent  united trades short term heating oil futures and option contracts  which are immaterial
