item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products on the us west coast 
for example  increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal through fiscal however  primarily due to the asian financial crisis  which severely curtailed demand and decreased prices  fiscal and results for the metals recycling business were negatively impacted 
during fiscal  the company saw demand for recycled metal rise  but unusually large supply became available in certain of the countries that were part of the former soviet union  which held prices down 
in addition  domestic demand for finished steel products was strong  but lower cost imports  primarily from asia  caused average prices to generally decline 
in fiscal  the demand for recycled metals declined in the us as domestic steel production declined  however  demand in asia  particularly in china  remained firm 
prices were still somewhat held down by supplies coming out of countries that were part of the former soviet union 
demand for finished steel products declined due to the slowing us economy and competition from lower cost imports 
the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business  and the breakdown of income from operations between the metals recycling business  the steel manufacturing business  joint ventures  corporate and eliminations 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues year ended august  in millions metals recycling business ferrous nonferrous other recycled metals total sales to the steel manufacturing business sales to unaffiliated customers steel manufacturing business total income loss from operations year ended august  in millions metals recycling business steel manufacturing business jvs in the metals recycling business jv suppliers of metals corporate expense intercompany eliminations income from operations ferrous recycled metal sales from the metals recycling business to the steel manufacturing business are made at a negotiated rate per ton that is intended to approximate market 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business 
because of this unallocated expense  the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand alone business 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for both the metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business were lower as consolidated revenues decreased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  a decrease of million 
ferrous revenues decreased million to million primarily as a result of lower average selling prices 
ferrous volumes decreased  tons and the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal decreased per ton to per ton 
however  prices firmed in the fourth quarter of fiscal as the volume of lower cost ferrous recycled metal from the countries of the former soviet union diminished 
the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating  tons  an increase of  tons in fiscal compared with fiscal demand from asia  particularly china  has remained strong and pushed ferrous export tons higher in fiscal compared with fiscal because of the softening u 
s 
economy domestic third party ferrous tonnage decreased  ton 
sales to the company s steel manufacturing business increased to  tons due to an increase in melt shop production at the company s steel mini mill 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due primarily to higher volumes 
improvements in the processes used to extract metal from the automobile shredding process and a temporary backlog of unprocessed shredder residue provided higher volumes of nonferrous metals  increasing sales volume by million pounds in fiscal compared with fiscal the average nonferrous selling price decreased per pound due to slowing demand caused primarily by the slowdown in the us economy 
the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues of million in fiscal  a decrease of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
sales of finished steel products declined to  tons while the average selling price per ton increased per ton to per ton 
the decrease in sales volumes came from all major product lines with the exception of reinforcing bar  for which sales volume approximated prior year levels 
the slight increase in the average sales price per ton is primarily due to the change in product mix 
during fiscal  the company focused on selling those products  such as reinforcing bar  which have higher margins 
the slowing us economy  as well as competition from lower cost steel imports  continues to impact sales volumes and prices 
on june   president bush asked the us international trade commission to investigate the effects of steel imports on the domestic steel industry under section of the trade act 
the commission has determined that some steel imports are a threat to domestic steel producers  and the president could impose safeguard restrictions on steel imports to aid the steel industry 
it is expected the president will rule on the safeguard restrictions  if any  by the end of cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold decreased million to million and was of revenues  consistent with fiscal however  gross profit decreased million to million 
cost of goods sold for the metals recycling business decreased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
cost of sales per ferrous ton decreased as demand for processed metal declined  allowing the company to lower the price paid for unprocessed metal 
gross profit decreased million compared with the prior fiscal year as the decline in the cost of unprocessed ferrous metal was more than offset by a decrease in the average selling price per ton for ferrous recycled metal 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business decreased million reflecting the lower sales volume for fiscal compared with fiscal cost of sales per ton  excluding billets  increased per ton compared with the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to decreased production volume  that spread fixed costs over fewer tons  and a higher volume of sales to california  which have higher freight and distribution costs than sales in the pacific northwest 
this increased cost of sales per ton resulted in a decrease in gross profit of million in fiscal compared with fiscal income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals 
the decrease in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to lower average ferrous selling prices partially offset by an increase in tonnage shipped 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal decreased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to competition from the countries of the former soviet union as well as lower demand from us steel mills 
the lower ferrous revenues were partially offset by higher nonferrous revenues 
this increase was due to greater nonferrous metal recovery from higher ferrous volumes processed and improved processes for the extraction of nonferrous metals 
in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to increased sales volume  increased margins and more efficient operations 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  which earned the majority of the income  instituted eva concurrently with the company 
this led to improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability 
also  the hugo neu joint ventures were able to lower buying prices as selling prices declined 
the company also benefited by million to reflect the company s share of lifo inventory adjustments 
in comparison  the results for fiscal were adversely affected by a million lifo inventory adjustment 
both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased sales by the company s self service auto dismantling joint venture 
increased sales prices and lower interest costs drove the improvements 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
the company averaged borrowings of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in average borrowings reflects a substantial decrease in borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal due primarily to inventory reductions then and during the first half of fiscal  as well as a million improvement in cash flow from the company s joint ventures 
this lower borrowing level continued through fiscal the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gain loss on sale of assets 
fiscal gain loss on sale of assets improved by million 
the increase is mainly attributable to the fact that last year s amount included a loss of million on the sale of a vessel used to export recycled metal 
other income 
other income decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a million change in gains and losses recognized on trust fund assets of a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for certain company executives 
other income was also adversely impacted by lower average interest rates on advances and notes to joint venture partners  resulting in a decrease of million 
income tax provision 
as part of the acquisition of proler international  corp 
proler  the company acquired million of federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
prior to fiscal  federal tax law placed limitations on the source of the income that could be offset by the nols 
accordingly  the company was not able to record the potential tax benefits from the nols because of the lack of certainty in being able to realize these benefits 
in fiscal  federal tax law was amended  which allowed the company to utilize the nols to offset substantially all of its taxable income 
as a result  in fiscal  the company utilized million of nols in determining its effective tax rate  which included a catch up of million of nols 
this change in tax law resulted in an effective tax of in fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to benefit from the utilization of million of nols  which was one of the primary reasons the effective rate was only as compared to the statutory rate of 
as noted above  federal income tax law limits the company s use of nols to million per year 
unused nols may be carried forward and used in subsequent fiscal years  though they will ultimately expire in fiscal years through  if not used by then 
subject to the annual limit  there remains at august  million of proler nols that may be used in future years before they expire 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business increased resulting in an overall improvement in consolidated revenues of million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal the strengthening asian economies had a particularly positive impact on volume and prices for the metals recycling business in fiscal the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of both higher volumes and higher average selling prices  both of which were primarily caused by the rebounding asian economies 
ferrous volumes increased  tons while the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased per ton to per ton 
the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating  tons during fiscal compared with export shipments totaling  tons during the prior year 
domestic third party tonnage increased by to  tons 
sales to the company s steel business decreased by to  tons 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due to higher volumes and higher average selling prices 
increased exports and a strong domestic market were primarily responsible for the nonferrous improvements  as well as the metals recycling business ability to produce more nonferrous products 
nonferrous volumes increased million pounds and the average selling price increased per pound 
the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues for fiscal of million  an increase of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
although the volume of finished steel products sold increased  the average selling price per ton declined 
sales of finished steel products increased to  tons as strong demand enabled the company to substantially increase production and sales of wire rod products 
however  the average selling price declined per ton to per ton 
the decline in average selling prices is primarily attributable to the dumping of lower priced steel products by asian companies on the west coast 
the decline in the average selling price is also partially due to a change in product mix 
during fiscal  the steel manufacturing business shipped proportionately more lower priced products principally wire rod than in the prior year 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold increased million to million and decreased as a percentage of revenues to  compared with in fiscal gross profit increased by million to million 
the metals recycling business cost of goods sold increased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
cost of sales per ferrous ton increased due to increased foreign demand for processed metal that directly impacted the demand for and cost of unprocessed metals 
the increase in the cost of unprocessed metal was more than offset by the increase in the average selling price increasing gross profit million compared with the previous fiscal year 
income from operations for fiscal increased million compared with fiscal  primarily due to the stronger asian economies 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million 
cost of sales per ton  excluding billets  declined by per ton primarily due to increased production that spread the allocation of fixed costs over more tons 
lower average selling prices more than offset this decline in operating costs per ton  but increased sales volume resulted in a gross profit of million which was million higher than in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million 
of this increase  million was due to annual salary merit increases and additional bonus accruals based on significant improvement in results during fiscal fiscal expenses also included million in write offs of uncollectible debts 
income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous metal 
the increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher ferrous selling prices and an increase in tonnage shipped 
also  fiscal revenues include a full year s results of a joint venture organized in the third quarter of fiscal shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to strengthening asian and other foreign economies 
in fiscal  the company s equity in income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business was adversely affected by million to reflect the company s share of lifo inventory adjustments 
in comparison  the results for fiscal benefited from million of lifo and other inventory adjustments 
the company s equity in income from the joint ventures in the metals recycling business for fiscal included the company s million share of a gain recognized by one of the joint ventures from the sale of property 
both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to higher ferrous selling prices 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million due to increased average borrowings and higher average interest rates 
average borrowings of million in fiscal exceeded average borrowings in fiscal of million 
the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gain loss on sale of assets 
in fiscal  the company and its outside board members approved the sale of a ship leased by the company from a related party to export recycled metal 
the sale resulted in a million loss 
fiscal results included the steel manufacturing business sale of its union city  california mill depot  resulting in a gain of million 
other income 
other income increased million 
during fiscal  the company received a million settlement as a result of antitrust litigation related to graphite electrodes pricing 
in fiscal  the company received million related to the same antitrust settlement 
also  the company recognized additional interest income during fiscal of million  related to advances to joint ventures  and million of investment income on assets related to the supplemental executive retirement plan due to strong domestic financial markets 
see note income tax provision 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income caused by utilization of million of net operating loss carryforwards nols that were acquired as part of the acquisition of proler 
by acquiring proler in  the company succeeded to million of nols incurred in proler s pre acquisition years 
federal income tax law limits the amount of proler pre acquisition nols that can be used by the company to million per year 
however  to the extent the respective annual limit exceeds taxable income for a taxable year  the unused excess may be carried over and used in subsequent taxable years 
previous federal tax rules limited the use of the proler nols to offset taxable income only from the acquired proler entities 
the new rules now allow the company to use the proler nols to offset taxable income from all sources 
during fiscal  federal income tax law changes were enacted that allow the company somewhat greater flexibility in utilizing the proler nols 
these changes allowed the company to utilize the annual limit of million for fiscal as well as an additional million of excess limit amounts from prior years 
subject to these annual utilization limits  the remaining million of proler nols may be used in future years until they expire at various amounts in fiscal through liquidity and capital resources 
for fiscal  cash generated by operations was million  compared to million last year 
the decrease in cashflow provided by operations was primarily the result of higher year end inventories 
capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
because of generally poor market conditions  coupled with larger capital investments in the mid to late s  the company has focused its capital investment on non discretionary capital and investments with shorter paybacks 
as part of its acquisitions of proler and mmi  the company assumed environmental liabilities aggregating million as of august  the company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities 
the company has an unsecured revolving credit agreement of million which expires in june as of august   the company had additional lines of credit available of million  which were uncommitted 
in the aggregate  the company had borrowings outstanding under these lines of million as of august  the company s debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
pursuant to a stock repurchase program  the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its stock when the market price of the company s stock is not reflective of management s opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock 
management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value and helps the company manage its targeted capital structure 
as of august   a total of million shares had been purchased under this program 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its stock for a total of million 
the company believes that the current cash balance  internally generated funds and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  debt service requirements  and future environmental obligations for the next year 
in the longer term  the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing 
factors that could affect future results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of one can generally identify these forward looking statements because they contain expect  believe  and other words which convey a similar meaning 
one can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
examples of factors affecting schnitzer steel industries  inc s wholly owned operations and its joint ventures the company that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following cyclicality and general market considerations selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to volatile supply and demand conditions beyond the company s control  resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices 
while the company attempts to maintain margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices  the company s ability to do so is limited by competitive factors as well as the impact of lower prices on the volume of scrap available to the company 
moreover  increases in recycled metals prices can adversely affect the operating results of the company s steel manufacturing business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices 
the steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions 
future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the company 
the company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income 
revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry  which is an important buyer of the company s finished steel products 
the timing and extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather 
the company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year 
customer requirements  shipping schedules and other factors limit the company s control over the timing of these shipments 
variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 
the company s expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes  as well as earnings  are based in part on the assumption that orders from customers for larger shipments are not cancelled or delayed 
competition the recycled metals industry is highly competitive  with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors  principally price 
the company has competition from both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals 
the company competes with a number of us and foreign recycled metals processors for sales to foreign customers 
the domestic steel industry also is highly competitive 
steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor 
the company competes with several steel producers in the western us for sales of its products 
in addition  in recent years  the company has experienced significant foreign competition  which is often subsidized by large government agencies 
there can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future 
on june   president bush asked the us international trade commission to investigate the effects of steel imports on the domestic steel industry under section of the trade act 
on october   the commission reached affirmative determination that of the product categories investigated were threatened by steel imports 
included in the threatened product categories were rebar and merchant bar  two of the steel manufacturing business larger volume  higher margin products 
the president could impose safeguard restrictions on steel imports to aid the steel industry 
the commission will submit its findings and recommendations to the president in december the company cannot  however  predict the recommendations or their impact on prices and operating results 
joint ventures the company has significant investments in joint venture companies 
the company does not manage the day to day activities of these businesses 
as a result  it does not have the same ability to control the operations and related financial results as it does with its wholly owned businesses 
these businesses are  however  impacted by many of the same risk factors mentioned above 
therefore  it is difficult to predict the financial results of these businesses 
energy supply the company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources to operate their facilities 
in particular  electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately of the cost of steel manufactured for the company s steel manufacturing business 
the steel manufacturing business purchases hydroelectric power under long term contracts from government sources which rely on the bonneville power administration bpa 
historically  these contracts have had favorable prices and are long term in nature 
the company recently signed a new five year contract that expires in septemer the bpa increased rates as of october  rates will be adjusted by the bpa every six months from then forward 
it is not possible to predict future rate changes 
the steel manufacturing business also has long term contracts for natural gas 
in october  the company entered into a new contract  which is set to expire on october  the latest contract negotiations resulted in rates that were higher then the previous agreement 
as this contract comes to an end  the company will attempt to negotiate a new long term contract  however  it is not possible to predict the terms of the contract 
the inability of the company to negotiate favorable terms of electricity  natural gas and other energy sources could adversely affect the performance of the company 
one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
further  the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments  principally long term debt 
sensitivity analysis was used to determine the potential impact that market risk exposure may have on the fair values of the company s financial instruments 
the company has assessed the potential risk of loss in fair value from hypothetical changes in interest rates by determining the effect on the present value of the future cash flows related to those market sensitive instruments of such changes 
the discount rates used for such present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at august   plus or minus percent 
a percent change in interest rates  with all other variables held constant  would result in an immaterial effect on consolidated earnings or cash flows 
this discussion of market risks necessarily makes forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that actual changes in market conditions and rates and fair values will not differ materially from those used in the sensitivity and fair value calculations discussed 
factors which may cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to greater than percent changes in interest rates or changes in income or cash flows requiring significant changes in debt instruments or cash flows associated with them 
at august   the company held no derivatives
