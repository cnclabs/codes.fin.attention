item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has not entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company holds notes receivable that earn interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would change annual interest income by  based on the balances of these variable rate notes receivable at december  changes in interest rates also impact interest expense on long term variable rate debt 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would change annual interest expense by  based on the balances of variable rate long term debt at december  management believes that market risk as a result of interest rate changes would have a minimal effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt because the fair value of the company s debt is traded based more on the public s perception of the nature of the debt than on any fundamental changes in the debt markets  therefore  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not necessarily impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt 
there were no significant changes in the company s market risk in the fiscal year ended december   and management foresees no significant changes in the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the near future
