the lower effective income tax rate in compared with was in part a result of a decrease in the french corporate income tax rate from percent for to percent for and a decline in the brazilian corporate income tax rate from percent for most of to percent for most of additionally  the lower effective income tax rate in was due to several items  including a million favorable adjustment to reduce spanish deferred income tax valuation allowances  favorable income tax treatment of a settlement related to a prior period claim and an equity related payment from brazil and income tax benefits associated with treatment of certain repatriations during the year

excluding the impact of this adjustment  the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  would have been percent 
the decrease from this adjusted effective income tax rate of percent to percent in was due to the reduction in the french statutory income tax rate from percent in to percent in and due to a greater proportion of the company s earnings being in brazil and the united states  which had lower income tax rates than france 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  us in millions cash provided by used for changes in operating working capital operations capital spending purchases of treasury stock the company s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations  which is principally obtained through operating earnings 
impacting the cash flow from operations are changes in operating working capital 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed favorably to cash flow by million due primarily to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by higher accounts receivable 
accounts payable and accrued expenses were higher in compared with as a result of recorded liabilities associated with capital projects and maintenance costs at december  accounts receivable was higher in compared with primarily because of increased french business unit export sales having longer payment terms 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed unfavorably to cash flow by million due primarily to lower accounts payable 
accounts payable was lower in compared with as a result of payments in early for capital projects included in accounts payable at december  in  changes in operating working capital contributed unfavorably to cash flow by million  excluding the acquired working capital balances of the brazilian and french businesses acquired in during  the company and philip morris reached agreement to proceed with the modification of paper machines and related manufacturing equipment at the company s spotswood mill to produce commercial quantities of a new proprietary banded cigarette paper for philip morris

new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which will require that all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no

the company s adoption of these new accounting rules is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
outlook although cigarette consumption and production in the united states were lower in than in the prior year as a result of declines in domestic cigarette consumption and exports of cigarettes manufactured in the united states  the declines were less than in and and sales volumes of the company s us business segment appear to be stabilizing 
the negative impact of lower us cigarette production is being partially offset by the company s increased market share within the north american market and this trend is expected to continue 
outside the united states  recent improvements in the company s sales volumes to several key markets compared with prior year levels  including eastern europe and russia  are also expected to continue 
growth in french reconstituted tobacco leaf volumes is anticipated in compared with sales of tobacco related papers within the brazilian market appear to be stabilizing 
the company s brazilian business continues to benefit from increased sales to latin american countries outside of brazil  although the level of these exports is being unfavorably impacted by the implementation of an export tax on some raw materials used in the manufacturing of cigarettes 
the new brazilian export tax  which was enacted in the third quarter of  is a percent tax which applies to tobacco related papers manufactured by the company s brazilian business and exported from brazil to other latin american countries 
this new tax was apparently enacted by the brazilian government in an attempt to reduce the quantity of contraband or smuggled cigarettes being sold in brazil 
modifications to the new export tax were enacted during the fourth quarter of and are expected to reduce the negative impact on our brazilian operation s exports from brazil  however  even as modified  the new tax is expected to unfavorably impact the company s financial results by approximately 
to 
per share per quarter  as it did beginning in the fourth quarter of cost of sales of certain products in brazil are also being unfavorably impacted by a recent change in the treatment of icms taxes see litigation under the caption legal proceedings in part i  item  which may reduce earnings by up to 
per share per quarter  as it did during the fourth quarter of swm b is evaluating possible changes in its business  including a possible change in its product mix  to minimize the impact of this matter on its financial results 
worldwide demand for tobacco related papers remains below worldwide capacity for such papers despite actions by suppliers to shut down less efficient machines 
the combination of this continuing excess worldwide capacity for tobacco related papers and the strong us dollar versus european and other foreign currencies is making it difficult to increase selling prices to offset the company s negative cost pressures since several competitors have cost structures that are based upon currencies that have weakened versus the us dollar 
cost reduction continues to be a priority in each of the company s business segments 
future periods are expected to benefit from various cost savings programs and certain past and future capital projects 
the per ton cost of wood pulp steadily increased during the latter half of and the first three quarters of additionally  higher energy costs were experienced throughout in each of the company s business segments 
the company has not been able to offset these cost increases with higher selling prices 
however  it appears that the cost of wood pulp has stabilized 
the company expects the per ton cost of wood pulp to decline in the first half of from its level at the end of which could provide an opportunity to regain some of the loss in gross profit margin experienced during in december  the french government enacted a reduction in the french corporate income tax rate from percent for to percent for and percent for and beyond 
considering this recent change  the company expects its consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately to percent for and to decline to approximately to percent for during the second quarter of  the company and philip morris reached agreement to proceed with the modification of paper machines and related manufacturing equipment at the spotswood mill to produce commercial quantities of a new proprietary banded cigarette paper for philip morris 
this new cigarette paper was jointly developed by the company and philip morris and may make a cigarette less likely to ignite certain fabrics 
capital spending to implement the banded cigarette paper project is currently expected to total approximately million in  in addition to amounts already incurred by the company as of december  the company does not expect this project to impair its ability to pursue other appropriate business opportunities 
the banded cigarette paper operations are expected to have a negative impact on financial results because of additional expenses associated with implementation 
excluding capital spending associated with the banded cigarette paper project  the company expects to control its capital spending to approximately to million for  focused primarily on product quality improvements and cost reduction opportunities 
during  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock during the period january  through december  in an amount not to exceed million 
common stock repurchases in will be dependent upon various factors  including cash availability  the stock price and strategic opportunities 
factors that may affect future results many factors outside the control of the company could impact the company s results 
the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
international business risks the company and its subsidiaries are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political and economic conditions  expropriation  import and export controls and restrictions  exchange controls  inflationary economies  currency risks  changes in business and income tax regulations and risks related to the restrictions of repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
euro currency conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legal currencies will be withdrawn from circulation by no later than february  the company established a committee to identify and implement changes necessary to address the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions  competitive implications of increased price transparency within european union countries  changes in currency exchange costs and rate exposures  continuity of contracts that require payment in a legal currency and tax implications of the conversion 
the company s french subsidiaries currently utilize multi currency software that was capable of euro denominated sales and purchase transactions on january  consideration has also been given to other potential issues in connection with the conversion  including those mentioned above 
the company s french subsidiaries are in the process of implementing already purchased software capable of translating current and historical data into euro currency data  which implementation will be fully completed no later than january   at which time the euro will become the functional currency of the french subsidiaries 
the company does not anticipate any significant negative consequences of these issues and does not anticipate that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
tax and repatriation matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various business and income tax laws in each of the countries in which it does business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
the company makes a comprehensive review of the business and income tax requirements of each of its operations  files appropriate returns and makes appropriate tax planning analyses directed toward the minimization of its tax obligations in these countries 
appropriate business and income tax provisions are determined on an individual subsidiary level and at the corporate level on both an interim and annual basis 
these processes are followed using a combination of internal staff at both the subsidiary and corporate levels as well as independent outside advisors in review of the various tax laws and in compliance reporting for the various operations 
dividend distributions are regularly made to the united states from certain foreign subsidiaries and are appropriately considered in the provision for us income taxes 
the company intends for the undistributed earnings of certain other foreign subsidiaries to be reinvested indefinitely 
these undistributed earnings are not subject to either additional foreign income taxes or us income taxes unless remitted as dividends 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us taxes on those earnings 
the company regularly reviews the status of the accumulated earnings of each of its foreign subsidiaries and reevaluates the aforementioned dividend policy as part of its overall financing plans 
hedging activities and foreign currency exchange risks management selectively hedges the company s foreign currency risks  as well as its exposure to interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt  when it is practical and economical to do so 
the instruments used to hedge foreign currency risks are forward contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts 
the company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
these instruments are purchased from well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually  the contracts extend for no more than months  although their contractual term has been as long as months 
management believes that credit risks with respect to the counterparties and the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged  were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts  are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
in addition to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on operating profit  foreign currency gains and losses have arisen from the remeasurement of non local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the operation is domiciled 
these gains and losses  related primarily to trade receivable and payable balances  are included in other income  net 
additional information concerning foreign currency related matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s cost structure 
effect of changing pulp costs per ton pulp costs tend to be cyclical in nature and are a large component of product costs 
the company consumed approximately   and  metric tons of wood pulp in  and  respectively 
during the period from january through december  the us list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  a representative pulp grade used by the company  ranged from a low of per metric ton to a high of per metric ton in the third and fourth quarters of generally  over time  the company has been able to increase its selling prices in response to increased per ton pulp costs  although this was not the case in as a result of other marketplace factors  and has generally reduced its selling prices when pulp costs have significantly declined 
the company may or may not be able to fully recover future pulp cost increases  or fully retain future pulp cost decreases  in its sales pricing structure 
seasonality sales of the company s products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the united states and brazil 
in the united states  customer shutdowns typically occur in july and december and typically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
in brazil  customer orders are typically lower in december due to a holiday season through much of january and february 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air  water and other emissions from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
the company believes it is operating in compliance with  or is taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while the company has incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  these costs are not expected to materially affect the company s business or results of operations 
the company  or its predecessor  is currently named as a potentially responsible party at two waste disposal sites  neither of which  individually  or in the aggregate  in management s opinion  is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that such an effect will not occur at some future time 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and its subsidiaries  management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of the company s customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in more than countries around the world 
two such customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities around the world  particularly in the united states  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in the fourth quarter of  the major us cigarette manufacturers reached agreement with all us states and several commonwealths and territories to settle health care cost recovery and other claims 
in anticipation of these settlements and as a direct result of these settlements  most of the us cigarette manufacturers have increased prices of cigarettes significantly 
domestic cigarette consumption has declined  in part due to these price increases which  in turn  decreases demand for the company s products 
during  the us department of justice filed a multi billion dollar civil suit against the tobacco industry 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms and for alleged violations of antitrust laws 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry  its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers 
also in recent years  certain governmental entities  particularly in the united states  have considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked 
the state of new york has enacted such a set of requirements scheduled to take effect beginning in cigarette manufacturers are in varying stages of development of cigarettes with such characteristics 
philip morris and the company previously announced the joint development of a banded cigarette paper that may make a cigarette less likely to ignite certain fabrics and have entered into a licensing and royalty agreement covering future commercialization of this new paper  the commercial viability of which has not yet been determined 
the company also continues to work on other possible innovations with other customers and on its own as the cigarette industry faces these evolving requirements 
it is not possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect the consumer tobacco products industry in general 
during  percent of the company s net sales were from products used by the tobacco industry in the making and packaging of cigarettes or other tobacco products 
management is unable to predict the effects that the above described legal and governmental actions might have on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  particularly in the foregoing discussion regarding the outlook of the company and factors that may affect future results  constitute forward looking statements  generally identified by  but not limited to  phrases such as the company expects or the company anticipates  as well as by use of words of similar effect  such as appears  could  should  may and typically 
this report contains many such forward looking statements  including statements regarding management s expectations of future selling prices for the company s products  the company s anticipated market shares  future market prices for wood pulp used by the company  expected sales volumes trends  new product introductions  anticipated cost savings  anticipated financial and operational results  anticipated capital spending  anticipated tax and other governmental actions  contingencies  anticipated common stock share repurchases and other expected transactions of the company 
forward looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company 
there can be no assurances that such events will occur or that the results of the company will be as estimated 
many factors outside the control of the company also could impact the realization of such estimates 
the above mentioned important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company
