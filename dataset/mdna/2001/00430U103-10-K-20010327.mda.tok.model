business overview pharmacopeia designs  develops  markets and supports science and technology based products and services intended to improve and accelerate the processes of drug discovery and chemical development 
the company s software segment provides molecular modeling and simulation  bioinformatics and cheminformatics software solutions that facilitate the discovery and development of new drug and chemical products and processes in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical  petrochemical and materials industries 
the company s drug discovery services segment provides drug discovery services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based on proprietary combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening technologies 
segment and geographical data are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to total revenue grew to million in compared to million in software segment revenue including software license  service  hardware and other revenue increased to million in compared to million in software license  service and other revenue increased to million in compared to million in this increase includes million  or  generated from sales of products and services added through the acquisitions of synopsys and the software subsidiaries of oxford molecular group plc see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of these acquisitions  software license  service and other revenue in increased by million  or  compared to hardware revenue  generated from the resale of computers  decreased by to million in compared to million in primarily because of a reorganization in the distribution channel of the company s sole supplier of hardware for resale 
software segment revenue in compared with increased in the european and us regions by 
this increase consisted of an increase in software license  service and other revenue  and a decrease in hardware revenue 
almost all of the increase in european and us region software license  service and other revenue resulted from the effects of the two acquisitions referenced above 
excluding the effects of these acquisitions  european and us region software license  service and other revenue increased only slightly 
management believes that this lack of internal growth was caused primarily by inefficiencies experienced by the company s sales organization as it absorbed sales responsibility for the acquisitions 
software segment revenue in compared with for the asia region increased by 
this increase resulted from increased modeling and simulation software orders from the company s distribution partner in japan pursuant to certain sales order level guarantees 
based upon an extended and renegotiated contract with this distribution partner  modeling and simulation software revenues in japan are not expected to increase beyond the level achieved in drug discovery services segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in this net increase of million was primarily attributable to the receipt of a one time million technology out license fee in the first quarter of  and a million increase in milestone fees received in compared to drug discovery services segment revenue in did not include any technology out license fees nor significant milestone fees 
excluding the technology out license fee and the increase in milestone fees  drug discovery services segment revenue decreased slightly compared to this slight decrease consisted of a million or decrease in library out licensing fees offset by an increase in other forms of drug discovery services 
in  one drug discovery services segment customer accounted for of consolidated revenue 
software segment gross margin increased to million of related sales in compared to million of related sales in the increase resulted primarily from the increase in software license  service and other revenue including the effect of acquisitions and from decreased hardware revenue which carries lower margins 
gross margin generated from the drug discovery services segment increased to million of related sales in compared to million of related sales in the increase in the amount of gross margin resulted from the increased technology out license and milestone revenues 
excluding technology out license and milestone revenues  gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased from in to in primarily because more fixed overhead was allocated to funded work while internal research declined 
research and development expenses declined to million in compared to million in including the effect of acquisitions 
research and development costs include costs associated with internal drug discovery programs and software development 
the decline in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the reduction of internally funded drug development activities in the company s drug discovery services segment  offset by increases in spending in the company s software segment primarily due to acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses is attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses  increases in administrative salaries and overheads  and increased amortization of acquired intangible assets  all primarily due to acquisitions in the company s software segment 
in  the company recorded one time charges of million related to acquired in process research and development  and goodwill amortization related to acquisitions of million 
in  there were no one time charges  and goodwill amortization was million 
net interest income increased to million in compared to million in this increase resulted primarily from the investment of the proceeds from a million private placement of the company s common stock in march the provision for income taxes increased to million in compared to million in the tax provisions are primarily due to foreign taxable income generated from the software segment 
these provisions differ from the federal tax rate primarily because of the effect of net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks 
as a result of the increased revenue and gross margins  net of the one time charges related to acquisitions  the increases in net interest income and the other matters described above  the company generated net income of million or per basic and diluted share in this compares to net income of million or per basic and diluted share in compared to total revenue grew to million in compared to million in total revenue including software license  service  hardware and other revenue generated from the software segment increased to million in compared to million in software license  service and other revenue increased to million in compared to million in hardware revenue  generated from the resale of computers  increased to million in compared to million in software segment revenue grew in the combined europe and us regions by in compared with management believes that this increase resulted primarily from a continuing increase in the size of the molecular simulation expert software market  from price increases and from an increase in the company s market share within this market 
software segment revenue for the asia region showed an increase of in compared with the small increase resulted entirely from the positive currency impact of the strengthening yen  which offset a decline in yen denominated sales 
management believes that this decline resulted primarily from the disruption in sales caused by the first quarter re negotiation of the company s distribution arrangements in japan 
asia sales levels began to recover in the latter portions of in addition  the company s distribution agreement in japan includes certain sales order level guarantees in as a result  management expects further recovery in asian sales levels in drug discovery services segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in this increase was attributable to the growth in the number and size of collaborations in progress  including several contracts signed in the latter half of and in early revenue growth in resulted generally from the company s new lead discovery service lds offering  whereby the company uses its proprietary high throughput screening system to screen the company s multi million quantity compound collection against customer drug targets 
revenue growth from lds was partially offset by declines in library out licensing revenue  in other forms of drug discovery services  and in one time milestone or up front license fee payments 
drug discovery services segment revenue included million and million of milestone payments in and  respectively 
in  one drug discovery services segment customer accounted for of consolidated revenue 
gross margin generated from the software segment increased to million of related sales in compared to million of related sales in this increase resulted primarily from the increase in software segment revenue  offset partially by higher costs for post sale software support activities 
gross margin generated from the drug discovery services segment increased to million of related sales in compared to million of related sales in this increase resulted from the increase in drug discovery services revenue  from a shift in mix of business from headcount based research services to fixed price high throughput screening services  and from cost efficiencies achieved by the transition of screening work to higher density formats 
research and development expenses declined to million in compared to million in research and development costs include costs associated with internal drug discovery programs  software development  ultra high throughput screening  and informatics 
the decline in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the reduction of internally funded drug development activities 
within its drug discovery services segment  the company began to decrease its internally funded drug discovery efforts in  and the company intends to focus primarily on funded drug discovery services in the future 
however  future research and development expenses may increase in total  even as unfunded internal drug discovery activities decrease  as the company may further expand its software  ultra high throughput screening  informatics and other development endeavors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in  representing of total revenue for both years 
the year to year increase of million is primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses within the software segment  reflecting the continuing expansion of the company s global distribution capacity in anticipation of additional products and product demand 
in  the company recorded goodwill amortization of million related to the acquisition of japanese distribution rights and the remaining joint venture interest 
in there was no goodwill amortization 
as a result of the merger with molecular simulations  inc msi  the company incurred million of merger related costs 
no such costs were incurred in the company recorded interest and other income of million and million for and  respectively 
interest income declined slightly in compared to primarily as a result of lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
however  foreign exchange gains in and the sale of an equity investment partially offset this decline 
foreign exchange gains were primarily the result of the positive currency impact of the strengthening yen 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million for and million for the and tax provisions are primarily due to foreign taxable income generated from the software segment 
these provisions differ from the federal tax rate primarily because of the effect of net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks 
as a result of the increased revenue  the increased gross margins  the decreased research and development costs  and the other matters described above  the company generated net income of million or per basic and diluted share for  compared to a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share in liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its activities to date primarily through the sale of equity securities  software licenses  software maintenance services  hardware and drug discovery services 
as of december   the company had working capital of million compared to million as of december  the increase was generated from a million private placement of the company s common stock in march and from operations  offset by various investing activities  including two acquisitions for the software segment 
in  the company also invested million in capital expenditures  which consisted primarily of computer hardware and laboratory equipment 
financing activities in provided million  primarily from the private placement  sales of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan participation 
as of december   the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  which are invested in us treasury and government agency obligations  investment grade commercial paper and other short term money market instruments 
this represents an increase of million from the year end level of million 
this increase was primarily the result of the receipt of proceeds from a million private placement of the company s common stock in march offset by cash used for acquisitions 
the company anticipates that its capital requirements may increase in future periods as the company expands its research and development activities  expands its facilities  and acquires additional equipment 
the company s capital requirements may also increase in future periods as the company seeks to expand its technology platform through investments  licensing arrangements  technology alliances or acquisitions 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be adequate to fund the company s operations at least through however  there can be no assurance that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time 
the company s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the ability of the company to continue to generate software sales  the ability of the company to extend existing drug discovery services agreements and to enter into additional arrangements  competing technological and market developments  changes in the company s existing collaborative relationships  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the outcome of related litigation  the purchase of additional capital equipment  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  and the progress of the company s customers milestone and royalty producing activities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company s forecasts of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is forward looking information  and actual results could vary 
the factors described earlier in this paragraph will impact the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds

significant risks  trends and uncertainties the following significant risks  trends and uncertainties  among others  could materially and adversely affect the company s future financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
acquisition strategy the success of the company s business strategy depends  in part  upon the successful acquisition of technologies and businesses that supplement and add to the company s current technologies 
however  critical technology may not be available to the company at affordable prices  the company may choose the wrong technologies  integration costs may be higher than anticipated  management s time and attention may be unduly diverted  key employees may not be retained  and earnings per share may be temporarily or permanently diluted 
uncertain revenue and profit levels the company s future revenue levels depend upon many factors  many of which are beyond the control of management 
these factors include changes in the demand for products and services  the introduction of competitive software and drug discovery services  changes in the research and development budgets of customers and potential customers  and the ability to successfully and timely develop  introduce and market new products  services and product enhancements and to gain cooperation of third parties as needed 
in addition  future revenue levels  especially drug discovery services revenue levels  are heavily dependent upon the life sciences industry s successful identification of new drug targets from genes and willingness to out source drug discovery work  and upon the company s ability to cost effectively develop and identify new drug candidates that interact with those targets 
rapidly changing technologies rapid technological change and uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies characterize the drug discovery and chemical development industries 
the company may not be able to develop  integrate and market  on a timely basis  the new and enhanced products and services necessary to keep pace with competitors 
failure to anticipate or to respond to changing technologies  or significant delays in product development or introduction  could cause customers to delay or decide against purchases of the company s products or services 
stock price volatility the company s stock price has experienced significant price volatility that is expected to continue in the future 
factors such as those described above  industry business combinations  quarter to quarter variations in operating results  the gain or loss of significant orders  and the ability to meet the operating expectations of analysts  among other things  will likely have a significant impact on the market price of the company s stock 
further  future fluctuations in the company s stock price could be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the company 
there can be no assurance regarding the future market price of the company s stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks consisting primarily of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s international sales generally are denominated in local currencies 
in  of the company s consolidated revenue was derived from customers outside the united states including from customers in europe and from customers in the asia pacific region 
the company s exchange rate risk is greatest for dollar euro and dollar yen fluctuations 
when deemed appropriate  the company engages in exchange rate hedging transactions in an attempt to mitigate the impact of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   the company had no hedging transactions in effect 
the euro s initial implementation was effective as of january   and the transition period will continue through january  on january   the company began to convert product prices from local currencies to euros as required 
the company implemented system changes to give multi currency capability to internal applications and to ensure that external partners systems processing euro conversions are compliant with the european council regulations 
the introduction and use of the euro has not had a material effect on the company s foreign exchange or hedging activities  and the company does not presently expect that it will 
all costs associated with the conversion to the euro are expensed to operations as incurred 
while the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro over time  based on currently available information  the company does not believe that the introduction of the euro currency will have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  the company regularly invests excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements that are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
the company believes that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal 
the company s exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income earned on its investment portfolio since the company has minimal debt 
the company ensures the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of the company s interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce the company s interest income
