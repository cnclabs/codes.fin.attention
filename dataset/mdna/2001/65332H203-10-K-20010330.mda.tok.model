acqua wellington will be required to purchase a pro rata portion of shares on each day during the trading period on which the daily weighted average price of the common stock exceeds a threshold price determined by the company and set forth in the draw down notice 
in addition  the company may  at its sole discretion  grant acqua wellington an option to purchase additional shares during such trading period 
the aggregate amount acqua wellington will be required to invest during any draw down period will depend on the threshold price established by the company for the draw down period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company maintains excess cash in a mutual fund  the blackrock low duration bond portfolio the fund  which invests in asset backed securities  bonds and various other commercial obligations 
the fund may  from time to time  use certain derivatives in its investment strategy 
additionally  the company maintains excess cash required for short term needs in daily money market funds with financial institutions 
two of the main risks disclosed by the fund are interest rate risk and credit risk 
typically  when interest rates rise  there is a corresponding decline in the market value of bonds such as those held by the fund 
credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the bond will not be able to make principal and interest payments 
the company addresses these risks by actively monitoring the fund s performance and investment holdings 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash as well as the value of the mutual fund in which excess cash is invested 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment of excess cash in a mutual fund  which invests in asset backed securities  bonds and various other commercial obligations 
the fund may  from time to time  use certain derivatives in its investment strategy 
the fund s portfolio managers make all investment decisions and the company has no control over such investment decisions or the fund s use of derivatives 
foreign currency risk changes in foreign exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
to date  the company has not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  as its international operations grow  the company may enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk
