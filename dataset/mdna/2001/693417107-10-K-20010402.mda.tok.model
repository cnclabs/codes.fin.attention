item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under certain factors that may affect future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview plx was founded in  and since we have focused on development of i o interface semiconductors and related software and development tools that are used in systems incorporating the pci standard 
in and  a significant portion of our revenues was from the sale of semiconductor devices that perform similar functions as our current products  except they were based on a variety of industry standards 
our revenues since have been derived predominantly from the sale of semiconductor devices based on the pci standard to a large number of customers in a variety of applications including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging  industrial and other embedded applications as well as in related adapter cards 
we generate a small portion of our revenues from sales of our software and development tools 
we utilize a fabless semiconductor business model whereby we purchase packaged and tested semiconductor devices from independent manufacturing foundries 
this approach allows us to focus on defining  developing  and marketing our products and eliminates the need for us to invest large amounts of capital in manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory 
we rely on a combination of direct sales personnel and distributors and manufacturers representatives throughout the world to sell a significant portion of our products 
we pay manufacturers representatives a commission on sales while we sell products to distributors at a discount from the selling price 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of title passage 
revenues from sales to distributors that are made under agreements which allow the return of products unsold by the distributor are not recognized until the distributor ships the product to its customer 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to third party distributors who may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our gross margins have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to changes in product mix  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  and specific product manufacturing costs 
the time period between initial customer evaluation and design completion can range from six to twelve months or more 
furthermore  there is typically an additional six to twelve month or greater period after design completion before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to these lengthy sales cycles  we may experience significant fluctuations in new orders from month to month 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results for that quarter and potentially future quarters would be materially and adversely affected 
in may  we purchased sebring systems  a development stage company  which is developing a switch fabric product 
in connection with this acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in return for the capital stock of sebring systems 
in addition  outstanding options of sebring systems were converted into options to purchase our common stock 
the transaction was accounted for using purchase accounting 
our long term success will depend on our ability to introduce new products 
although typically new products generate little or no revenues during the first twelve months following their introduction  our revenues in subsequent periods depend upon these new products 
due to the lengthy sales cycle and additional time for customers to commence volume production  significant revenues from our new products typically occur only twelve to twenty four months after product introduction 
as a result  revenues from newly introduced products have been a small percentage of revenues in the year the product was introduced 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays with regard to our expected revenues 
results of operations the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods shown 
fiscal year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest income and other  net income loss before income taxes and equity in net loss of unconsolidated investee provision for income taxes income loss before equity in net loss of unconsolidated investee equity in net loss of unconsolidated investee net income loss comparison of years ended december   and increasing overall end customer demand during the second half of and the first half of resulted in capacity constraints and increasing order lead times for semiconductor suppliers 
longer lead times and concern about availability of semiconductor components  resulted in increased order rates for standard products during the first three quarters of compared to the same periods in  resulting in increased order backlog 
orders from oem customers and contract manufacturers serving the network and telecommunications market were especially strong in the first nine months of as these customers attempted to secure semiconductor components to meet their projected end demand 
however  the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because customer end demand can change very quickly and  semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
customers continuously adjust their inventories resulting in frequent changes in demand our products 
the volatility of customer demand limits our ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
the semiconductor industry experienced significant changes in the supply and demand situation during shipments to our customers declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter as these customers attempted to align inventories with revised demand projections 
in the fourth quarter of  our customers and the contract manufacturing firms that serve them  began to adjust their inventories to lower demand projections  resulting in cancellations and rescheduling of previously placed orders 
this activity  combined with the overall slowing of economic growth in the north american economy  led to lower order rates in the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in  and a reduction in order backlog from the end of the third quarter 
net revenues 
revenues consist of product revenues generated principally by sales of our semiconductor devices 
revenues for were million  an increase of million or from revenues for were million  an increase of million or from in each year the increase was primarily due to higher volume shipments of pci products 
gross profit 
gross profit represents net revenues less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing semiconductor devices from our independent foundries  additional assembly and testing costs  our operating costs associated with the procurement and storage of products  as well as royalty expenses paid on some of our products 
gross profit for was million  an increase of million or from gross profit for was million  an increase of million or from gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  in and in in each year  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to higher revenues 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased in from and in from primarily due to lower product costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design  and development activities 
in addition  expenses for outside engineering consultants and non recurring engineering at our independent foundries are included in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were million  an increase of million or from research and development expenses for were million  an increase of million or from research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue from to was primarily due to the amortization of deferred compensation associated with the acquisition of sebring systems  a one time compensation charge related to a severance agreement  and increased headcount and higher costs to support the company s continuing efforts to develop new products 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue from to was primarily due to higher net revenues as well as lower expenses for non recurring engineering at our independent foundries 
the increase in absolute dollars in and was primarily due to the addition of personnel for the development of new product and the enhancement of existing products  as well as payments to outside consultants where specific resources were needed in the development process 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will likely increase in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  trade show and other promotional expenses  as well as sales commissions to manufacturers representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of million or from selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of million or from selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in in each year  the increase in absolute dollars principally reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from an increase in sales and marketing personnel as well as increased sales commissions from higher product revenues 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars will likely increase in future periods 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets was million in amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets related to the acquisition of sebring systems in in process research and development 
in may  we acquired sebring systems  inc  a development stage company  that was developing the sebringring tm  a silicon switch fabric interconnect solution 
switch fabrics route data in a flexible  high speed manner in embedded systems  and our new switch fabric product will provide high availability and pci compatibility features not found in previous or current standard products 
we wrote off approximately million of acquired in process research and development associated with this acquisition in fiscal this write off was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and there was no alternative future use 
we estimate that the project was complete as of december  the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally relate to the completion of all testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including features  functions and performance 
we expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
however  there are no assurances that this will occur 
if we fail to complete the product in its entirety  or in a timely manner  our sales and profitability could be adversely impacted  and the value of the other acquisition related intangible assets may become impaired 
the million fair value of the acquired in process technology was determined by a valuation specialist 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the project once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the discount rate utilized was  and was based on the cost of capital for well managed venture capital funds which typically have similar risks and returns on investments 
the cash flows utilized were based on estimates of revenues  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  royalty costs and income taxes from the project 
the research and development costs excluded costs to bring the acquired in process project to technological feasibility 
the estimated revenues were based on management projections of the acquired in process project 
the business projections were compared with and found to be in line with industry analysts forecasts of growth in substantially all of the relevant markets 
estimated total revenues from the acquired in process technology product were assumed to peak in fiscal and decline in fiscal as other new products were expected to become available 
these projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of our new product introductions  as well as competitors new product introductions 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the technology acquired were based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the rights and uncertainties identified in the risk factors set forth in this form k 
deferred compensation 
in connection with the grant of restricted stock and options to our employees during and  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation of  representing the difference between the deemed value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the restricted stock purchase price or stock option exercise price at the date of grant 
the amount of deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable stock grants 
we also recorded deferred compensation of million related to stock options granted below fair market value to employees in relation to the acquisition of sebring systems in may additionally  we recorded deferred compensation of million in connection with the grant of stock options below fair market value to our employees in september amortization of deferred compensation recorded in  and was   and  respectively 
these amounts are substantially included in research and development expenses 
we expect to record compensation expenses related to deferred compensation of approximately  per quarter through september interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment balances 
interest income and other  net increased to million in from million in interest income and other  net increased to million in from  in the increase from to was primarily due to interest earned on higher levels of short term investments  long term investments  and cash balances 
the increase from to was primarily due to interest earned on higher levels of short term investments  long term investments  and cash balances generated by the initial public offering in april provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the period ended december  was  on a pretax loss of  compared to income tax expense of  on pretax income of  and income tax expense of  on pretax income of  for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to non deductible acquisition related items partially offset by the benefit of research and development tax credits 
our income tax expense differs from the expected expense derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to income from operations primarily due to state taxes offset by the benefit of research and development tax credits 
our income tax expense differs from the expected expense derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to income from operations primarily due to the benefit of research and development tax credits and the realization of deferred tax assets 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated investee 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated investee represents losses recognized under the equity method of accounting for the investment in sebring systems in the fourth quarter of in may  the company purchased the remaining interest in sebring systems and consolidated its results from the date of acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations 
at december   we had million in working capital including million in cash and cash equivalents 
our operating activities generated cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million of cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to our net loss of million adjusted for non cash charges of million associated primarily with the acquisition of sebring systems and an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in deferred tax assets  a decrease of million in inventories and a decrease of million in other current assets 
our investing activities used cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to the purchase of a million new facility 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in  million in and  in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to cash generated from a loan used to purchase plx s primary facilities in the fourth quarter of in november  we entered into a loan agreement to borrow million in connection with our purchase of a facility in sunnyvale  california 
the agreement includes covenants regarding profitability and sets interest at a rate of libor plus 
the agreement requires monthly interest payments with the outstanding principal balance due and payable in november in january  the board of directors of the company approved a stock repurchase program whereby up to  shares of its common stock may be purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we had no material purchase commitments outstanding 
we believe that our existing resources  together with cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the inventory levels we maintain  the level of investment we make in new technologies and improvements to existing technologies and the levels of monthly expenses required to launch new products 
to the extent that existing resources and future earnings are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
additional funds may not be available or  if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us and our stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities sfas  which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
we are required to adopt sfas  as amended  effective january  we anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have no impact on results of operations or financial position  as we hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
sab was effective for our fiscal year the adoption of sab did not have a material affect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
and among other issues clarifies the following the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of the previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the application of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on february   the financial accounting standards board issued a limited revision of its september  exposure draft  business combinations and intangible assets  that proposes to significantly change the accounting for goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination 
under the revised proposal  goodwill would not be amortized but would be reviewed for impairment  using a complex methodology different from the original proposal  when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
goodwill impairment charges would be presented as a separate line item within the operating section of the income statement 
the nonamortization approach would apply to previously recorded goodwill as well as goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after the application of the new standard 
amortization of the remaining book value of goodwill would cease and the new impairment only approach would apply 
the fasb expects to release the final statement in june the provisions of the proposed statement are to be applied at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter following its issuance for all entities 
certain factors that may affect future operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  without limitation  statements regarding the company s expectations  objectives  anticipations  plans  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future

all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
these cautionary statements should be considered in the context of the factors listed below  as well as those disclosed from time to time in the company s reports on forms q and k 
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include the following our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to factors which are not within our control our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to fluctuate significantly in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are not in our control 
our operating expenses  which include product development costs and selling  general and administrative expenses  are relatively fixed in the short term 
if our revenues are lower than we expect because we sell fewer semiconductor devices  delay the release of new products or the announcement of new features  or for other reasons  we may not be able to quickly reduce our spending in response 
other circumstances that can affect our operating results include our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  the timing of significant orders  order cancellations and reschedulings  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or suppliers  including decreases in unit average selling prices of our products  introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  shifts in our product mix toward lower margin products  the availability of production capacity at the fabrication facilities that manufacture our products  and the availability and cost of materials to our suppliers 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could adversely affect our business 
any shortfall in our revenues would have a direct impact on our business 
in addition  fluctuations in our quarterly results could adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays with regard to our expected revenues our customers typically perform numerous tests and extensively evaluate our products before incorporating them into their systems 
the time required for test  evaluation and design of our products into the customer s equipment can range from six to twelve months or more 
it can take an additional six to twelve months or more before a customer commences volume shipments of equipment that incorporates our products 
because of this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between the time when we increase expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time when we generate higher revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
in addition  the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans 
when we achieve a design win  there can be no assurance that the customer will ultimately ship products incorporating our products 
our business could be materially adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
rapid technological change could make our products obsolete the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to identify trends in our target markets and to offer new semiconductor devices  as well as other products and services  that address the changing needs of our target customers 
we must make significant research and development expenditures prior to generating revenues from products to establish market acceptance of a new semiconductor device  we must dedicate significant resources to research and development  production and sales and marketing 
we incur substantial costs in developing  manufacturing and selling a new product  which often significantly precede meaningful revenues from the sale of this product 
consequently  new products can require significant time and investment to achieve profitability 
prospective investors should note that our efforts to introduce new semiconductor devices or other products or services may not be successful or profitable 
in addition  products or technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we record as expenses the costs related to the development of new semiconductor devices and other products as these expenses are incurred 
as a result  our profitability from quarter to quarter and from year to year may be adversely affected by the number and timing of our new product launches in any period and the level of acceptance gained by these products 
our independent manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements we do not manufacture any of our semiconductor devices 
therefore  we are referred to in the semiconductor industry as a fabless producer of semiconductors 
consequently  we depend upon third party manufacturers to produce semiconductors that meet our specifications 
we currently have third party manufacturers that can produce semiconductors which meet our needs 
however  as the semiconductor industry continues to progress to smaller manufacturing and design geometries  the complexities of producing semiconductors will increase 
decreasing geometries may introduce new problems and delays that may affect product development and deliveries 
due to the nature of the semiconductor industry and our status as a fabless semiconductor company  we could encounter fabrication related problems that may affect the availability of our semiconductor devices  may delay our shipments or may increase our costs 
our reliance on single source manufacturers of our semiconductor devices could delay shipments and increase our costs none of our semiconductor devices is currently manufactured by more than one supplier 
we place our orders on a purchase order basis and do not have a long term purchase agreement with any of our existing suppliers 
in the event that the supplier of a semiconductor device was unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture this product in the required volume  we would have to identify and qualify a substitute supplier 
introducing new products or transferring existing products to a new third party manufacturer or process may result in unforeseen device specification and operating problems 
these problems may affect product shipments and may be costly to correct 
silicon fabrication capacity may also change  or the costs per silicon wafer may increase 
manufacturing related problems may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense competition in the markets in which we operate may reduce the demand for or prices of our products competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
if our main target market  the embedded systems market  continues to grow  the number of competitors may increase significantly 
in addition  new semiconductor technology may lead to new products that can perform similar functions as our products 
some of our competitors and other semiconductor companies may develop and introduce products that integrate into a single semiconductor device the functions performed by our semiconductor devices 
this would eliminate the need for our products in some applications 
in addition  competition in our markets comes from companies of various sizes  many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and thus can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
also  as we start to sell our processor products  we will compete with established embedded microprocessor companies and others 
many of these indirect competitors and microprocessor companies have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than plx 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  and increased competition may adversely affect our business 
see business competition  and products 
failure to have our products designed into the products of electronic equipment manufacturers will result in reduced sales our future success depends on electronic equipment manufacturers that design our semiconductor devices into their systems 
we must anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of current and potential future electronic equipment manufacturers and must successfully develop and manufacture products that meet these requirements 
in addition  we must meet the timing requirements of these electronic equipment manufacturers and must make products available to them in sufficient quantities 
these electronic equipment manufacturers could develop products that provide the same or similar functionality as one or more of our products and render these products obsolete in their applications 
we do not have purchase agreements with our customers that contain minimum purchase requirements 
instead  electronic equipment manufacturers purchase our products pursuant to short term purchase orders that may be canceled without charge 
we believe that in order to obtain broad penetration in the markets for our products  we must maintain and cultivate relationships  directly or through our distributors  with electronic equipment manufacturers that are leaders in the embedded systems markets 
accordingly  we will often incur significant expenditures in order to build relationships with electronic equipment manufacturers prior to volume sales of new products 
if we fail to develop relationships with additional electronic equipment manufacturers  to have our products designed into new embedded systems or to develop sufficient new products to replace products that have become obsolete  our business would be materially adversely affected 
lower demand for our customers products will result in lower demand for our products demand for our products depends in large part on the development and expansion of the high performance embedded systems markets including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging and industrial applications 
the size and rate of growth of these embedded systems markets may in the future fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors 
these factors include the adoption of alternative technologies  capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
demand for products that incorporate high performance embedded systems may not grow 
defects in our products could increase our costs and delay our product shipments our products are complex 
while we test our products  these products may still have errors  defects or bugs that we find only after commercial production has begun 
we have experienced errors  defects and bugs in the past in connection with new products 
our customers may not purchase our products if the products have reliability  quality or compatibility problems 
this delay in acceptance can make it more difficult to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  product errors  defects or bugs can result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
in the past  the additional time required to correct defects has caused delays in product shipments and resulted in lower revenues 
we may have to spend significant amounts of capital and resources to address and fix problems in new products 
we must continuously develop our products using new process technology with smaller geometries to remain competitive on a cost and performance basis 
migrating to new technologies is a challenging task requiring new design skills  methods and tools and is difficult to achieve 
failure to hire additional personnel and to improve our operations will limit our growth we have experienced rapid growth which places a significant strain on our limited personnel and other resources 
to manage our expanded operations effectively  we will need to further improve our operational  financial and management systems 
we will also need to successfully hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
we may not be able to manage our growth effectively  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
also  we are seeking to hire additional skilled development engineers  who are currently in short supply 
our business could be adversely affected if we encounter delays in hiring additional engineers 
we could lose key personnel due to competitive market conditions and attrition our success depends to a significant extent upon our senior management and key technical and sales personnel 
the loss of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel in the semiconductor industry is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  we may lose key personnel due to attrition  including health  family and other reasons 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our business could be materially adversely affected 
a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to third party distributors who may terminate their relationships with us at any time we depend on distributors to sell a significant portion of our products 
in  net revenues through distributors accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
some of our distributors also market and sell competing products 
distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will depend in part on our ability to attract additional distributors that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
we may lose one or more of our current distributors or may not be able to recruit additional or replacement distributors 
for example  in march  we decided to terminate our relationship with unique  our us distributor that accounted for of our fiscal year  revenues  and service all of our us customers directly or through manufacturers representatives 
the loss of one or more of our major distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business as we may not be successful in servicing our customers directly or through manufacturers representatives 
the demand for our products depends upon our ability to support evolving industry standards substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of products  which rely on the pci standard 
if the embedded systems markets move away from this standard and begin using new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that use these new standards 
there is also the risk that new products we develop in response to new standards may not be accepted in the market 
in addition  the pci standard is continuously evolving  and we may not be able to modify our products to address new pci specifications 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the successful marketing and sales of our products depend upon our third party relationships  which are not supported by written agreements when marketing and selling our semiconductor devices  we believe we enjoy a competitive advantage based on the availability of development tools offered by third parties 
these development tools are used principally for the design of other parts of the embedded system but also work with our products 
we will lose this advantage if these third party tool vendors cease to provide these tools for existing products or do not offer them for our future products 
this event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we generally have no written agreements with these third parties  and these parties could choose to stop providing these tools at any time 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position our future success and competitive position depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal products 
currently  we have limited protection of our intellectual property in the form of patents and rely instead on trade secret protection 
our existing or future patents may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others 
the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to us 
in addition  our future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned or licensed by us 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries where we may need protection 
we cannot be sure that steps taken by us to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation of the technology 
we may from time to time receive notifications of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by other third parties 
while there is currently no intellectual property litigation pending against us  litigation could result in significant expenses to us  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technology 
this litigation could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor 
in addition  we may not be able to develop or acquire non infringing technology or procure licenses to the infringing technology under reasonable terms 
this could require expenditures by us of substantial time and other resources 
any of these developments would have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we sell our products to customers outside of north america and because our products are incorporated with products of others that are sold outside of north america we face foreign business  political and economic risks sales outside of north america accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that these sales may increase in future periods and may account for an increasing portion of our revenues 
in addition  equipment manufacturers who incorporate our products into their products  sell their products outside of north america  thereby exposing us indirectly to foreign risks 
further  most of our semiconductor products are manufactured outside of north america 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  political and economic instability  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  potentially adverse tax consequences  timing and availability of export licenses  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for telecommunications and other products  and the burden of complying with complex foreign laws and treaties 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date exclusively in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
integration of sebring systems may be difficult to achieve  which may adversely affect operations our acquisition of sebring systems involves risks related to the integration and management of acquired technology  operations and personnel 
the integration of sebring systems with our business has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
we must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communications systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating our operations  including our ability to bring to market the products in development  potential conflicts between business cultures  perceived adverse changes in business focus  potential conflicts in distribution  marketing or other important relationships  and the loss of key employees and or the diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns 
our potential future acquisitions may not be successful because of our limited experience with acquisitions in the past there have been a significant number of mergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor industry in the past 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  improve market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
in may  we acquired sebring systems 
we have no current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any acquisitions  and we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities 
future acquisitions could result in the following potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large one time write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
since we have had limited experience with acquisitions in the past  we are not certain that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that may be acquired in the future 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders our principal stockholders beneficially owned a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock as of december  although these stockholders do not have majority control  they currently have  and likely will continue to have  significant influence with respect to the election of our directors and approval or disapproval of our significant corporate actions 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  the voting power of these stockholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of plx 
the anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation may make a change in control of plx more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions may allow the board of directors to prevent changes in the management and control of plx 
under delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
one anti takeover provision that we have is the ability of our board of directors to determine the terms of preferred stock and issue preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
currently  there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion without approval of the holders of the common stock  the rights and preferences of this preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock 
accordingly  the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  short and long term investments and restricted cash and investments of approximately million at december  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
the company invests primarily in high quality  short term and long term debt instruments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in less than million decrease less than in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with a promissory note to borrow million in connection with our facility purchase in interest payments on the note are tied to the libor rate 
we have evaluated the changes in the payments arising from hypothetical changes in libor and such changes would not be material to our results of operations or financial position
