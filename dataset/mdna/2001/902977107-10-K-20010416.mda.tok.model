item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain information contained in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although the company believes that expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved 
forward looking information is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks  trends and uncertainties include the highly cyclical nature of the forest products industry  general economic conditions  competition  price conditions or trends for the company s products  the possibility that timber supply could be affected if governmental  environmental or endangered species policies change  and limitations on the company s ability to harvest its timber due to adverse natural conditions or increased governmental restrictions 
the results of the company s operations and its ability to pay quarterly distributions to its unitholders depend upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
these factors include general economic and industry conditions  domestic and export prices  supply and demand for logs  seasonality  government regulations affecting the manner in which timber may be harvested  and competition from other supplying regions and substitute products 
these and other risks are described in the company s other reports and registration statements  which are available from the united states securities and exchange commission 
general the company s primary business is the growing and harvesting of timber see item business 
the company s results of operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond its control  including general industry conditions  domestic and international prices and supply and demand for logs  lumber and other wood products  seasonality and competition from other domestic and international supplying regions and substitute products 
supply and demand factors supply the supply of logs available for purchase has been most affected in recent years by significant reductions in timber harvested from public timberlands  principally as a result of efforts to preserve the habitat of certain endangered species  as well as a change in the emphasis of government policy toward habitat preservation  conservation and recreation and away from timber management 
since the early s  environmental and other similar concerns and governmental policies have substantially reduced the volume of timber under contract to be harvested from public lands 
the pace of regulatory activity accelerated in the late s 
the resulting supply decrease caused prices for logs to increase significantly  reaching peak levels during the low supply of timber from public lands  which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future  has benefited private timber holders such as the company through higher stumpage and log prices 
certain market conditions for finished products  however  have negatively impacted stumpage and log prices in industry participants do not expect environmental restrictions to ease materially within any reasonable planning horizon 
consequently  many producers of lumber and wood products are attempting to adapt to the new supply environment by increasing their emphasis on raw material yields  entering into long term timber supply arrangements and value added manufacturing  and accessing previously untapped supplies such as private wood lot owners  timber with difficult access  alternative species and imports 
these factors have tended to restrict prices from significant increases 
while raw material supply is expected to be an ongoing challenge for the lumber and wood products industry  such conditions would likely be favorable for timber owners such as the company 
in response to an increase in timber prices in the early s  imports of logs and lumber from abroad from countries such as canada and new zealand increased 
these imports  however  only partially offset the lost volume of timber from public timberlands and did not replace the mature  high quality timber found in greater quantities on public timberlands 
imports are likely to continue to increase over the next few years and could significantly affect the raw material supplies in the domestic lumber and wood products industry 
demand changes in general economic and demographic factors  including the strength of the economy  unemployment rates and interest rates for home mortgages and construction loans  have historically caused fluctuations in housing starts and  in turn  demand and prices for lumber and commodity wood products 
united states housing starts for were down significantly from levels 
because of the growth of the home center distribution business  the repair and remodeling markets have become a significant factor in terms of the demand for lumber and commodity wood products and have dampened the wide fluctuations that occurred when new housing starts were the primary factor 
a large portion of the company s property consists of pine species  which are used in the finishing market  for molding trim  doors and windows 
this market is more affected by repair and remodeling than new housing construction 
prices for these species  primarily ponderosa pine  reached a peak in the spring of and as a result attracted imports of radiata pine from new zealand and chile 
given the strong  growing economy of the past several years  domestic markets have been able to absorb the increasing quantities of imported radiata pine lumber 
with the current slowing of our domestic economy  decreasing demand for repair and remodeling markets and over supply of finished products in the industry  the level of imports could have a negative impact on pricing for pine lumber 
the demand for logs in the united states is also affected by the level of lumber imports 
in response to increasing lumber imports from canada  the united states and canada signed an agreement in which restricted the availability of canadian softwood lumber in the united states 
the company believes that this agreement  which expires on march   has not had a material impact on the price or demand for logs in the united states although its long term effect  as well as the effect of its termination  is uncertain 
due to transportation costs  domestic conversion facilities in the pacific northwest tend to purchase raw materials within relatively confined geographic areas  generally within a mile radius 
the conversion facilities in the vicinity of the timberlands need more wood supply to run at capacity than can be produced by nearby timberlands 
as a result  the demand from this region is relatively steady  although prices fluctuate with market conditions 
current market conditions log prices in the northwest drastically declined during as compared to due to the slowing united states economy and supply and demand factors 
during  the united states economy began experiencing an economic slow down 
mortgage interest rates were climbing to levels significantly higher than those experienced over the past few years and as such created weakening conditions for new home construction  home repair and remodeling  and industrial and other construction  which weakened the demand for finished lumber and plywood products 
as a result of the decreased demand and excess production capacity within the industry the markets for finished lumber and plywood products dropped to their lowest levels in the last ten years 
as a result of the weakening in the finished products markets  the prices being realized for the company s logs and timber declined significantly from levels 
prices for the company s logs and stumpage are also at or near ten year lows 
prices for the fourth quarter of remained weak continuing a trend started near the end of the second quarter 
for the fourth quarter of  the company s average delivered log prices for ponderosa pine  douglas fir  lodgepole pine  and white fir were down approximately    and  respectively  from the same period in the excess production levels of are expected to continue into the first half of  reducing the chances of a near term recovery of wood product prices 
in addition  the impact of the expiration of the agreement between canada and united states limiting the canadians lumber imports into the united states through march  is yet to be determined and could add to the over supply of finished wood products 
as a result of the above conditions  the company does not expect a significant increase in prices during results of operations the following table sets forth sales volume for each of  and from the sale of logs  stumpage and timber deeds by thousand board feet mbf and price per thousand board feet and the sales of property

revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in log sales of million and a million decrease in stumpage sales  partially offset by a million increase in timber deed sales and the fact that the company had a million dollar timber and property sale in to meet its working capital requirements  the company harvested and sold logs and stumpage in at rates in excess of both levels and the estimated current annual board footage growth on the timberlands 
log sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to log sales of million on volumes of  in the average log sales price for was compared to an average log sales price of in  a decrease  reflecting weaker markets for the company s log sales 
timber deed sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to timber deed revenue of million on volumes of  mbf in the average timber deed sales price per mbf for was compared to an average timber deed sales price of in  a decrease 
the significant decrease in timber deed sales realization is due to overall declines in market conditions as well as a reduction in the quality of the timber mix being sold in timber sales 
during there were less timber deed sales containing larger  old growth timber which commands a premium  than in in addition the company s timber deed sales in the second quarter represented substantially all of the remaining old growth timber on the ochoco timberlands and was of a lower grade species mix than sales of timber on the ochoco timberlands in previous years 
stumpage sales for were million on volumes of mbf  compared with stumpage sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the reduction in stumpage volumes is a result of the company s strategic decision to utilize log sales and timber deed sales as its primary source of revenue 
the company had million in revenue from planned timber and property sales in compared to no revenue from timber and property sales during gross profit 
gross profit decreased million from million in to million in and gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease in gross margin was primarily from three factors 
first  contracted log and haul costs on a per mbf basis were approximately higher during as compared to due to longer hauls for delivered logs and higher fuel costs 
second  the company s timber deed sales were composed of a lower value grade mix as compared to finally continued declines in the timber markets have resulted in lower realizations on delivered log and stumpage values 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  consistent with selling  general and administrative expenses of million in within selling  general and administrative expenses salaries and wages were up million and professional services were up million over those increases were offset by a settlement with previous employees of million in equity in net income loss of affiliate 
the equity in net income of affiliate was million during as compared to equity in net loss of affiliate of million in the income in reflects the recapture of million in losses absorbed from its preferred investment in us timberlands yakima  llc  and the company s accrued return of million on its preferred investment 
during  the company absorbed million in losses on its common investment in us timberlands yakima  llc and million in losses absorbed by its preferred investment in us timberlands yakima  llc

interest expense 
interest expense was million in and consisting primarily of interest expense on the company s million of senior notes 
other income expense  net 
other income  net  was million for  compared to million for  representing a decrease in income of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a mark to market gain on an interest rate collar of approximately million during and no such gains in cash flow from operations 
during  cash flow from operations increased million or over primarily because of a million decrease in net income  which was more than offset by the addback of non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
partners capital during the limited partner interest in the company declined million from million to million 
this decline was the result of distributions to unitholders of million during as well as the limited partners share of the company s net loss of million in the general partner interest in the company also declined during reflecting its share of the company s distributions and net loss for the company anticipates that partners capital will continue to decline given current operating conditions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in timber deed sales of million and a million increase in log sales  partially offset by a million reduction in stumpage sales  a million decrease in by products and other revenues and the fact that the company had no land sales in compared to approximately million in land sales in to meet its working capital requirements  the company harvested and sold logs and stumpage in at rates in excess of both levels and the estimated current annual board footage growth on the timberlands 
timber deed sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to no timber deed revenue for log sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared to log sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the average log sales price per mbf for was compared to an average log sales price per mbf of for  a increase  reflecting stronger markets  primarily for white fir and douglas fir logs 
stumpage sales for were million on volumes of  mbf  compared with stumpage sales of million on volumes of  mbf in the average stumpage sales price per mbf for was compared to an average stumpage sales price per mbf of for  a reduction 
the decrease in average stumpage sales prices from to was primarily due to a reduction in the grade of timber harvested from the ochoco timberlands 
the overall reduction in stumpage sales volume is due to the increased use of timber deed sales in the company had no revenue from timber and property sales during as compared to approximately million in planned timber and property sales during gross profit 
gross profit increased by million from million in to million in and gross margin increased from in to in the increase in gross margin was primarily from three factors 
first  the company s normal annual review of its standing timber inventory and depletion rate during the first quarter of resulted in a reduction of the company s depletion rate  and a savings of approximately million in also  the company did not have any land sales during  which have typically resulted in lower margins than log  stumpage and deed sales 
in addition to the above items  the company benefited from an overall increase in log prices during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million from million in to million in this expense also decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the decrease was primarily attributable to one time expenses of million related to severance costs and the repurchase of member interests in the general partner that were incurred during the first and fourth quarters of  combined with the provision in for the closure of the seattle office 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million as compared to million for  representing a million or reduction 
interest expense for both and was incurred primarily on the million of notes issued in the november public note offering 
the slight decrease in interest expense in can be attributed to a reduced level of borrowing against the available revolving credit facilities during as compared to interest income 
interest income for was million  an increase of million or from interest income for of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to imputed interest from deed sales with a term of more than one year 
imputed interest income from deed sales was approximately million in the increase in interest from timber deed sales was partially offset by a reduction in other interest income due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents available in compared to other income expense  net 
other income  net  was million for compared to other expense  net  of million for  representing an increase to income of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to a mark to market gain on an interest rate collar of approximately million during in addition  revenues from land use management operations such as grazing permits increased in cash flow from operations 
during  cash flow from operations increased million or primarily as a result of increased gross margins and a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses  offset partially by decreased proceeds from timber and property sales  increase in balance of notes receivable and a decrease in accrued liabilities 
partners capital during the limited partners interest in the company declined million from million to million 
this decline was the result of distributions to unitholders of million during partially offset by the limited partners share of the company s net income of million in the general partner interest in the company also declined during reflecting its share of the company s distributions and net income for liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities as well as debt and equity financings 
as of december  the company had a cash balance of million and had million of working capital 
operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million in the million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a million decrease in net income which was more than offset by the addback of non cash operating items and the changes in assets and liabilities 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in  as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million during the increase is primarily attributable to a purchase of cutting rights in june for approximately million  partially offset by the company s million investment in affiliate in financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in and during and  the company paid million in distributions to unitholders  general partner and minority interest 
notes on november   the operating company issued million aggregate principal amount of notes the notes representing unsecured general obligations of the operating company which bear interest at per annum  payable semiannually in arrears on may and november the notes mature on november  unless previously redeemed 
the notes will not require any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments prior to maturity and are redeemable at the option of the operating company in whole or in part  on or after november  at predetermined redemption prices plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as defined in the indenture  the company must offer to purchase the notes  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
there can be no assurance that the company will have access to sufficient funds to repurchase the notes in the event of a change in control 
the indenture governing the notes the indenture contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants applicable to the operating company and its subsidiaries  including limitations on the ability of the operating company and its subsidiaries to  among other things  i incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness unless the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is greater than to  and ii make distributions to the company  make investments other than permitted investments in any person  create liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  suffer to exist any restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to make distributions or repay indebtedness to the company  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  enter into a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets  sell assets or harvest timber in excess of certain limitations or engage in a different line of business 
under the indenture  the operating company will be permitted to make cash distributions to the company so long as no default or event of default exists or would exist upon making such distribution a if the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is greater than to  in an amount  in any quarter  equal to available cash as defined in the indenture for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter or b if the operating company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is equal to or less than to  in an aggregate amount not to exceed i million less the aggregate of all restricted payments made under this clause b i during the immediately preceding fiscal quarters or shorter period  if applicable  beginning on the issue date of the notes  plus ii the net proceeds of certain capital contributions including the sale of units received by the company 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  and affiliate credit facility during the second quarter of  the company renewed its existing credit agreement with an affiliate of the general partner affiliate credit facility 
the affiliate credit facility allows the company to borrow up to million under certain terms and covenants 
the covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to make cash distributions  incur certain additional indebtedness or incur certain liens 
in addition  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios 
the affiliate credit facility will expire on june  at that time  amounts borrowed will be due and payable 
as of december  there were no outstanding borrowings under the affiliate credit facility 
the company s intent is to replace the affiliate credit facility with a bank facility during the company also has the ability to generate cash flow through the acceleration of planned log and timber deed sales 
in addition  the company s intent is to use new funds raised through investment and commercial banks for acquisitions  if any  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
under the affiliate credit facility  so long as no event of default as defined in the affiliate credit facility exists or would result  the operating company will be permitted to make quarterly cash distributions to the company in an amount not to exceed available cash as defined in the affiliate credit facility in the preceding quarterly period 
capital expenditures cash distributions capital expenditures in totaled million 
the company purchased timber cutting rights for approximately mmbf of timber for million 
the remaining million in capital expenditures incurred were mainly in the nature of land management silvicultural costs  miscellaneous equipment and computer hardware 
capital expenditures were financed through cash flow generated by operations 
as the company does not currently own and does not plan to own manufacturing facilities  and all logging is subcontracted to third parties  it is anticipated that capital expenditures in the future will not be significant and will consist mainly of land management silvicultural expenditures 
it is currently anticipated that the company will not maintain significant log inventories  although small log inventories may be maintained for a short period of time  or incur material capital expenditures for machinery and equipment 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures will be approximately million in capital expenditures will consist primarily of capitalized silvicultural costs and miscellaneous equipment purchases 
cash required to meet the company s debt service and the quarterly cash distributions will be significant 
to meet its working capital requirements  the company has been selling logs and making timber sales at a rate in excess of the general partner s estimate of the current annual board footage growth on the company s timberlands 
the debt service and quarterly cash distributions have been funded from operations and borrowings 
given projected volumes for sales of logs and timber  estimated current board footage growth on the timberlands and the harvest restrictions in the notes  unless prices improve  costs are reduced  new markets are developed or the company makes accretive acquisitions  the company s ability in the future to make distributions at current levels will be adversely affected 
the company continues to evaluate means to improve cash flows  including the factors mentioned above 
there can be no assurance that prices will improve or that the company will be able to take any of these actions and it is unlikely prices will improve or any of these actions will take effect within a short term horizon 
effects of inflation prices for the company s stumpage and logs may be subject to sharp cyclical fluctuations due to market or other economic conditions  including the level of construction activity but generally do not directly follow inflationary trends 
costs of forest operations and general and administrative expenses generally reflect inflationary trends 
recent developments in november  the company announced that an independent committee of the board of directors had been formed to evaluate management proposals to take the company private 
the independent committee has retained separate legal counsel and intends to retain financial advisors to assist in this process 
to date  a proposal from management has not been received
