item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating results all other properties operating results of all other properties are summarized as follows in thousands revenues    operating and interest expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization minority interest earnings from operations there were no significant changes in the operating results of all other properties during the period 
gain loss on properties the  gain on properties for is due primarily to the final resolution of contingencies in the sale agreements relating to properties sold in funds from operations the company uses a supplemental performance measure along with net earnings to report its operating results 
this measure is referred to as funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit as net earnings computed in accordance with gaap  excluding cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles  extraordinary items  and gains or losses on sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap 
ffo is not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company s ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other reits because they may not use the current nareit definition or they may interpret the definition differently 
ffo was  in   in and  in the increases in ffo in and were due primarily to the property acquisitions and the development and redevelopment projects referred to above and higher rents from re leased space 
the reasons for significant changes in revenues and expenses comprising ffo by segment are described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in   and  respectively 
the changes in cash provided by operating activities were due primarily to the factors discussed above in the comparisons of operating results 
the level of net cash provided by operating activities is also affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and the payment of operating and interest expenses 
net cash used by investing activities increased by  to  in from  in the increase was due primarily to higher levels of acquisitions and development activity 
net cash used by investing activities increased by  to  in from  in the increase was primarily a result of higher distributions to minority partners  and a distribution of refinancing proceeds  in  partially offset by a lower level of operating property acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in compared to net cash used by financing activities of  in financing activities provided cash in primarily because of financing refinancing activity for four shopping centers 
net cash used by financing activities decreased by  to  in from  in the decrease was due primarily to cash provided from financing one shopping center  and refinancing another shopping center  partially offset by increased share repurchases of  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued the company currently has a  unsecured line of credit available for various purposes  including acquisition  development or redevelopment of properties and liquidity  subject to various terms and conditions 
the note payable under the bank line of credit had an outstanding balance of  at december  the company has registered to sell up to an aggregate of approximately  based on the public offering price of additional common shares of beneficial interest and or debt securities 
the shares and debt may be issued from time to time at prices  in amounts and on terms to be determined at the time of offering 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  mart is required to pay dividends to its shareholders of at least of its reit taxable income 
mart intends to pay these dividends from operating cash flows 
while mart intends to distribute to its shareholders a substantial portion of its cash flows from operating activities  mart also intends to retain or reserve such amounts as it considers necessary from time to time for the acquisition or development of new properties as suitable opportunities arise and for the expansion and renovation of its shopping centers 
also  mart currently has and expects to continue to maintain a line of credit from its primary bank 
the company anticipates material commitments for capital expenditures to include  in the next two years  the ongoing redevelopment of twelve projects  in the planning stage  at an estimated cost of  the company expects to fund the development projects and other capital expenditures with available net cash flows from operating activities and if necessary with construction loan financing  long term mortgage financing on unencumbered operating properties or the use of its line of credit 
it is management s intention that mart continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business 
management cannot practically quantify mart s cash requirements  but expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through available net cash flow provided by operations and short term borrowings 
to meet its long term capital requirements  mart intends to obtain funds through additional equity offerings  joint ventures or long term debt financing in a manner consistent with its financial strategy 
the company anticipates that the cash flow available from operations  together with cash from borrowings and equity offerings  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital needs in both the short and long term 
market risk information the market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial and commodity instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable rate borrowings used to maintain liquidity eg  credit line borrowings or finance project development costs eg  construction loans 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  the company relies primarily on long term  fixed rate nonrecourse loans from institutional lenders to finance its operating properties 
in addition  long term fixed rate financing is typically arranged concurrently with or shortly after a variable rate project construction loan is negotiated or the project is complete 
the company has not used derivative financial or commodity instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored closely by management 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other data required to evaluate the expected cash flows of the company under debt agreements and its sensitivity to interest rate changes 
at december   the company s variable rate debt relates to borrowings under its credit line and construction loans 
the credit line borrowings are assumed to be repaid at their various repricing dates throughout the construction loans are assumed to be repaid at their maturity in as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise after december   the company s hedging strategies  if any  during that period and interest rates 
in thousands fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt       weighted average interest rate variable rate debt      weighted average interest rate item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation the majority of leases for the shopping center properties contain provisions for annual increases in rents and or provisions  which may entitle mart to receive percentage rents  based on the tenants gross sales 
such provisions ameliorate the risk to mart of the adverse effects of inflation 
if a recession were to begin and continue for a prolonged time  ffo could decline as some tenants may have trouble meeting their lease obligations 
most of the leases for the properties require the tenants to pay a substantial share of operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  and thereby reduce mart s exposure to increased costs 
in addition  many of the leases for the properties are for terms of less than years  which may enable mart to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases if rents are below the then existing market rates
