item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we discover  develop and intend to commercialize small molecule drugs and recombinant proteins  primarily for bone and mineral disorders and central nervous system disorders 
we have five drugs in clinical development and several preclinical product candidates 
our two most advanced product candidates focus on bone and mineral disorders 
they are amg  which has completed a series of phase ii clinical trials for treatment of hyperparathyroidism  and alx  which is in a pivotal phase iii clinical trial for treatment of post menopausal osteoporosis 
on december  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of allelix  a biopharmaceutical company based in ontario  canada for  shares of our common stock and assumed options and warrants for the issuance of an additional  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  with an effective date of december  accordingly  operating results of allelix are only included in our consolidated statements of operations for periods after that date 
we did  however  record an expense of million in for in process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of allelix 
substantially all of our resources are devoted to our research and development programs 
to date  we have not completed the development of any pharmaceutical product for sale 
we have incurred cumulative losses through december  of approximately million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of approximately million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue to expand our clinical trials and research activities 
in particular  we recently initiated an  to  patient phase iii clinical trial for alx  and expect to expend a significant portion of our resources on the development of this product 
results of operations revenues substantially all our revenues have come from license fees  milestone payments  and research and development support payments from our licensees and collaborators 
these revenues fluctuate from year to year 
all of the research and development support payments under our existing license or collaborative agreements expired in our revenues were million in  million in  and million in we recognized revenue from our agreements as follows 
under our agreement with glaxosmithkline we recognized million in  million in  and million in  
under our agreement with kirin  we recognized million in each of   and  
under our agreement with amgen we recognized  in each of   and  
under our agreement with forest  we recognized  in and nothing in each of and  
under our agreement with lilly canada  we recognized million in  and nothing in each of and  
under our agreement with janssen parmaceutica  nv  we recognized million in  and nothing in each of and  and 
under our agreement with technology partnership canada  we recognized  in and nothing in each of and the increases in revenues in were primarily due to revenues from license agreements we acquired as a result of our purchase of allelix 
in addition  we received a million one time milestone payment from glaxosmithkline 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of payments that we may earn in the future under these agreements 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses arise primarily from the compensation and other related costs of our personnel who are dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid to outside professionals to conduct clinical studies and trials 
our research and development expenses increased to million in from million in after a decrease from million in the decrease in research and development expenses from to was principally due to the completion of phase clinical trials for nps in mid the increase in research and development expenses from to is principally due to the commencement of a pivotal phase iii clinical trial for alx and a pilot phase ii clinical trial from alx  two product candidates that we acquired as a result of our acquisition of allelix 
we have the right to be reimbursed under our agreement with technology partnerships canada  or tcp  for a portion of our research and development expenses for alx we expect research and development expenses to increase as these clinical trials progress and as we begin to manufacture alx for market launch 
we may incur additional research and development expenses if we start other clinical trials  or if we acquire new technologies  product candidates  or companies 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our executive management  finance and administrative staff  business insurance  taxes and professional fees 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased costs of our operations including our recently acquired subsidiary  nps allelix  and a charge of  for compensation expense for stock options held by management that vested on the signing of a license agreement in we expect that general and administrative expenses in the future will equal or exceed the amount for in order to support operations in canada and the us and pre launch commercialization costs for product candidates 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles 
we are required to amortize goodwill and other acquired intangibles as a result of our december  acquisition of allelix 
the remaining intangible assets at december  total approximately million 
we are amortizing these assets over their expected lives  which range from two to six years 
we recorded amortization expense of million in we did not record any amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles in and  since the effective date of the allelix acquisition for accounting purposes was december  in process research and development acquired 
we recorded an expense of million in for in process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of allelix 
the acquired in process research and development consisted of five drug development programs 
the two most advanced product candidates  alx  for osteoporosis  and alx  for gastrointestinal disorders  accounted for of the total value of the acquired in process research and development 
we determined the fair value assigned to the in process research and development by estimating the total costs to develop the product candidates into commercially viable products ie  to obtain fda approval 
we then discounted the projected net cash flows related to these product candidates back to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
at the date of the acquisition  the product candidates had not yet received fda approval and had no alternative future uses 
since the date of the acquisition  we revised our plans for the next series of clinical trials for alx and alx we started a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with alx  which we expect will include an month course of treatment in  to  patients with osteoporosis 
we also started enrolling a small number of patients with short bowel syndrome in a pilot phase ii clinical trial with alx since the date of acquisition and through december   we have incurred development costs of approximately million for alx and million for alx total development costs and time to completion for each of these product candidates will depend on the costs we incur to conduct current clinical trials and any additional testing we find necessary to obtain fda approval 
we believe the assumptions we used in the valuation of the in process research and development we acquired from allelix were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
however  we have modified our development plans as new data have become available regarding each product candidate 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results in the valuation 
other income expense interest income 
interest income was million in  million in  and million in the increase from to is the result of higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities 
these balances increased primarily due to cash received from a private placement offering of million common shares of the company which was completed in february and closed in april  and from a follow on offering of million shares of the company which was completed in november we expect that interest income will be higher in due to higher average cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment security balances for the year resulting from these offerings 
however  we anticipate that interest income will decrease in the future as cash is utilized for operations 
loss on disposition of equipment  leasehold improvements  and leases 
loss on the disposition of equipment  leasehold improvements  and leases was million in   in  and zero in the increase in the loss from to is primarily due to a non cash loss of approximately million in associated with closing a facility in new jersey that we acquired as part of the acquisition of allelix in december we anticipated at the time of the acquisition that we would sublease the facility for the remaining nine year term of our lease obligation and retain the existing leasehold improvements 
however  we were able to negotiate a release of our obligation from the landlord subject to our forfeiting the leasehold improvements and certain office furniture and equipment which had a net book value of approximately million 
we expect that the loss on disposition of equipment  leasehold improvements  and leases in the future to be immaterial 
cumulative effect on prior years to december  of changing to a different revenue recognition method 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
under our previous accounting policy  revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees were recognized when received when we had no further obligations relative to such licensing fees 
in compliance with sab no 
 we now recognize revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees over the continuing involvement period with each licensee 
the adoption of sab no 
resulted in an increase in operating income of  and no change in the net loss for the year ended december  prior year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting principle 
taxes 
as of december  we had a us federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a us federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million 
we also had a canadian federal and provincial income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and million  respectively  a canadian research pool carryforward of approximately million and a canadian investment tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
our ability to utilize the us operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of our equity securities 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative revenues from payments for research support and license fees and million from the sale of equity securities for cash 
the sale of equity securities includes million received from the exercise of options during  million  net  from the sale of million shares of common stock we closed in april  million net  from the sale of million shares of common stock we completed in november  million from the sale of  shares of common stock under the terms of an agreement with an existing corporate licensee during may   from the sale of common stock under the terms of our employee stock purchase plan  and million from the exercise of warrants to acquire  shares of exchangeable shares of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  nps allelix inc the exchangeable shares may be exchanged into the company s common shares at any time 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities  which totaled million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million and  provided by investing activities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities in was due primarily to the first full year of operations for nps allelix corp  our canadian subsidiary  which was acquired in late december the allelix transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the subsidiary s operations were therefore not included in the years ended december  and net cash used in investing activities in was almost entirely the result of investing the proceeds from our private placement  follow on offering  and option and warrant exercises in marketable investment securities 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the proceeds from the private placement which closed in april  the follow on offering which closed in november  and from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
during the past  we have received research and or development support payments under our agreements with amgen  kirin  glaxosmithkline  and under nps allelix s agreements with janssen and lilly canada 
with the exception of glaxosmithkline  all of the research and development support payments under these agreements expired in funded research with glaxosmithkline continues on a month to month basis 
we do not receive any research and development support payments under our agreements with abbott laboratories  forest laboratories  or astrazeneca 
however  we could receive future payments of up to million in the aggregate if we accomplish specified research and or development milestones under our agreements with all of those parties 
some of the late stage development milestone payments will not be due from astrazeneca if we elect a co promotion option 
each of these agreements also require the licensees to make royalty payments to us if they sell products derived from the license rights 
however  we do not control the subject matter  timing  or resources applied by our licensees to their development programs 
thus  potential receipt of milestone payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control 
each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee under certain conditions 
we have an agreement with technology partnerships canada  or tpc  a canadian government program  under which tpc will reimburse us for our research expenses for treatments for various intestinal disorders using our alx product 
tpc will reimburse us for of the qualified costs we incur through december  to a maximum of cdn 
million 
we will pay a royalty to tpc on revenues received from the sale or license of any product we develop from the funded research 
those payments terminate in december if we have paid tpc a total of at least cdn 
million through that date  or if we have paid tpc less than that amount through that date  the payments continue until the earlier of when we have paid tpc a total of cdn 
million or december as of december   we have invoiced tpc for a total of cdn 
million for reimbursement 
we have entered into sponsored research and license agreements that obligate us to make research support payments to academic and or commercial research institutions 
we may be required to make additional payments if the research institutions reach milestones  or for license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses 
we expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
we expect that our existing capital resources  including interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
however  our actual needs will depend on numerous factors  especially with regard to the clinical trials and pre launch marketing and production costs for alx furthermore  if we advance current propriety programs or if we in license or otherwise acquire other technologies  product candidates or companies  we may need to make substantial additional expenditures 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities  our adoption of sfas no 
 on january   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs  and maximize yields 
the securities we hold in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types  and maturities  which consist mainly of fixed rate financial instruments 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
after a review of our marketable securities  we believe that in the event of a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements 
foreign currency risk 
some of our research and development operations are in canada 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  or by weak economic conditions in canada 
when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada decreases 
when the us dollar weakens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada increases 
the monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary which are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash  marketable investment securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and certain accrued liabilities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar from the december  rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in canada to change by an insignificant amount 
we are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities  although we may engage in those types of activities in the future
