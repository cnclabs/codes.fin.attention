the remaining balance of million is scheduled to be paid in fiscal the acquisition agreement with integrity sciences  inc includes an earn out agreement over a five year period of up to  shares of phoenix s common stock and cash payments of million  if certain revenues and technology criteria are met 
there is no minimum payment requirement in the earn out agreement 
no payments have been earned through september  the acquisition agreement with xentec requires that insilicon canada issue up to an additional  exchangeable preferred shares to the former xentec stockholders over a two year period  contingent upon the achievement of certain performance based milestones 
additional goodwill will be recorded for the fair value of this consideration as the exchangeable preferred shares  if any  are issued 
there is no minimum payment requirement in this contingent consideration and no payment was earned or paid for fiscal also under the terms of the acquisition  in january insilicon will issue common stock with a fair value of million to former xentec employees who continue their employment with insilicon through december  the million is being recognized as stock based compensation expense over the one year period subsequent to the merger  and as of september   million of this amount is included in payroll and related liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
if the performance milestones specified in the earn out agreements are met  payments will be accrued and recorded as additional goodwill 
on march   phoenix s majority owned subsidiary  insilicon  closed its initial public offering of million shares 
proceeds  net of issuance costs  to insilicon were approximately million 
the principal purpose of the offering was to increase insilicon s equity capital  to create a public market for its common stock  to facilitate future access to public equity markets  to improve the effectiveness of its stock option plan in attracting and retaining key employees  to provide liquidity to phoenix and to provide increased visibility of insilicon in the marketplace 
on september   phoenix owned approximately of insilicon s common stock

license fee and service revenues by segment for fiscal   and were as follows dollars in thousands amount of revenues change of revenues platform enabling    insilicon    information appliance  n a n a phoenixnet tm   n a total revenues    total revenues in fiscal decreased by million or from fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of the global economic slowdown and softness in the pc market 
platform enabling revenues in fiscal decreased by million or from fiscal due to softness in the pc market which had a significant impact on our core business in the north america and taiwan regions 
platform enabling revenues increased by million or in fiscal  mainly due to higher volume royalty license fees from two oem customers 
insilicon revenues in fiscal decreased by million or from fiscal due primarily to the challenging economic environment  particularly in north america 
revenues in fiscal increased by million or from fiscal due to greater market acceptance of semiconductor intellectual property  increased acceptance of re use licenses of semiconductor intellectual property to existing customers  and increased maintenance revenues from insilicon s growing installed base of customers 
information appliance first generated revenues in the third quarter of fiscal north america and japan were the two main regions contributing to these revenues 
phoenixnet tm revenues in fiscal increased by million or from fiscal  primarily due to its shift in business focus from homepage and search settings solutions to device authentication security products and services during fiscal phoenixnet tm first generated revenues in the second quarter of fiscal revenues by geographic region based on country of sale for fiscal   and were as follows dollars in thousands amount of revenues change of revenues north america    japan    taiwan    other asian countries    europe    total revenues    in fiscal  north america  japan  taiwan  and europe revenues decreased while other asian countries revenues increased 
the decrease in north america  japan  taiwan  and europe was due primarily to the economic slowdown in the global economy which had a significant impact on the pc market 
the increase in other asian countries was attributed to improved sales development efforts in korea and china 
in fiscal  revenues from japan  taiwan  and other asian countries increased while north american revenues remained relatively flat and european revenues decreased 
this fluctuation of revenues was due primarily to the outsourcing of system design and manufacturing to asian pc and motherboard manufacturers  insilicon s release of their usb controller  growth in japan pc shipments in the platform enabling segment  and a shift in revenues from the european market to the asian market 
taiwan  japan  and other asian countries revenues in fiscal increased despite lower average selling prices of our bios products than in fiscal  partly due to a shift in demand for personal computers from desktop to notebook computers 
one customer accounted for of total revenues in fiscal another customer accounted for and of revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal   or gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was   and for fiscal   and  respectively

in addition  a million write off of capitalized software in fiscal was reclassified from restructuring cost to cost of revenues for presentation purposes 
for fiscal   and  gross margin as a percentage of revenues before the amortization of purchased technology and software development costs  yk support costs reversal of yk support costs  and write off of capitalized software was   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower margins on information appliance and insilicon product sales 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was due to an increase in license revenues from the platform enabling division and insilicon  especially in asia 
license fee gross margin as a percentage of license fee revenues was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
service gross margin as a percentage of revenues was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
total amortization of capitalized purchased technologies and software development costs charged to costs of revenues in fiscal  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses represented   and  respectively 
in fiscal  research and development expenses increased by million or due to increased expenses relating to recent acquisitions  the launch of a new division  and establishment of a new development center in asia 
in fiscal  research and development expenses decreased by million or due to the improvement of product and resource management resulting in lower headcount and the movement of research and development centers to asia and japan where costs were lower partially offset by an increase in variable compensation due to the attainment of increased revenues

also included in the fiscal general and administrative expenses was an increase in bad debt provision of million from fiscal to reflect current market slowdown 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increases in personnel  especially in the phoenixnet tm segment and insilicon  and variable compensation due to higher profitability 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles amortization expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  amortization expense increased by million from fiscal  primarily due to various purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amortization expenses in fiscal and were related to the sand acquisition  which was completed in fiscal stock based compensation the stock based compensation expenses were million  million  and nil in fiscal   and  respectively 
charges in fiscal were mostly due to the granting of options to purchase phoenix and insilicon stock at exercise prices less than the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 
impairment of long lived assets impairment of long lived assets were million in fiscal and nil in fiscal and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  insilicon performed an assessment of the carrying value of its long lived assets to be held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with its various acquisitions 
the assessment was necessitated by various factors that indicated these assets may be impaired  including recent operating results that did not meet management s expectations  the global downturn in technology spending  and sustained decline in insilicon s market capitalization 
the conclusion of insilicon s assessment was that indicators of impairment were present and therefore a test was required 
insilicon performed an asset impairment test with the assistance of independent valuation experts 
the test was performed by comparing the undiscounted expected cash flows for a five year period the estimated life of the assets  to the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from purchase business combinations 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows reflect management s best estimates 
also with the assistance of independent valuation experts  insilicon determined the fair value of the impaired long lived assets 
fair value was determined using the cash flow method and the income approach using the same assumptions as those used in the initial test of impairment 
based on the results of the test  insilicon determined that the goodwill associated with xentec was impaired and a write down of goodwill and intangible assets totaling million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflecting the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed their respective fair values 
the write down was included in impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no impairment charges of long lived assets in fiscal or for insilicon 
phoenix also conducted an assessment of the carrying value of its long lived assets due to similar impairment indicators and determined that no impairment charges were required in fiscal   or restructuring costs restructuring charges for fiscal   and  were as follows years ended september  in thousands severance and other exit costs    asset write offs write off of capitalized software of million that was previously categorized as restructuring charges in fiscal was reclassified to costs of revenues for presentation purposes 
charges in april  in efforts to optimize operational efficiency and change its business strategy to address changes in customer demands  we reduced our global workforce by approximately employees across all business functions 
the restructuring included refocusing research and development efforts  re evaluating sales and marketing and general and administration resource requirement  and aligning overall cost structure with current revenue levels 
all terminations were completed as of september  the restructuring program resulted in a charge of approximately million for severance and related cost in the third quarter of fiscal as of september   approximately million was paid and an additional million was accrued and expected to be paid through the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the restructuring program  we expect pretax savings in operating expenses to be approximately million on an annualized basis 
charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  phoenix recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance benefits associated with the elimination of three management positions 
the charges were related to the streamlining of certain management functions in taiwan and north america 
all terminations were completed as of september  charges in fiscal  we incurred million of restructuring charges relating to the realignment of its business into three operating divisions  consolidation of certain facilities and operations  integration of award and sand  and discontinuation of the pico and pc enhancing division 
these charges included million in severance costs associated with the elimination of positions across all business functions from various product divisions and management  million of fixed assets write down for the company s united kingdom branch  million in facilities abandonment  and million of other business exit costs pursuant to the re organization plan 
all terminations were completed as of september  charges subsequent to fiscal year end in october  due to continuing global economic downturn and industry trends  we announced a restructuring program that would reduce its global workforce by approximately 
this restructuring program will align our expense structure with current market conditions to return to profitability 
this reduction will result in a one time charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal as part of the restructuring program  we also announced a reorganization plan that would align its corporate actions with corporate strategy to improve customer focus  unify product marketing  streamline engineering  and create a market driven development process 
the corporate marketing and products division or cmpd  will be customer focused and responsible for product marketing functions and applications development activities 
the corporate engineering and planning division or cepd  will be technology focused and includes the core development resources and deployment engineering group 
the global sales and support division or gssd  will focus on growing customer base and revenues 
as a result of the restructuring program announced in october  we expect a pre tax saving of million on an annualized basis starting from the second quarter of fiscal in december  insilicon announced a restructuring program to realign ongoing expense structure 
this restructuring program will result in a one time charge of million which includes a global workforce reduction by approximately and a substantial non cash write down of previously capitalized software 
the restructuring is expected to be completed by the first quarter of fiscal insilicon anticipated an annualized cost saving of approximately million from this restructuring program 
interest and other income  net net interest and other income was million  million  and million in fiscal    respectively 
net interest and other income consists mostly of interest income 
interest income is primarily derived from cash and short term investments 
the income generated each period is highly dependent on available cash and fluctuations in government interest rates 
the average interest rate earned in fiscal was approximately 
all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are in usd and are not subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest income was million  million  and million in fiscal    respectively  of which million in fiscal was insilicon s 
interest income decreased by million and increased by million in fiscal year and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the average cash balance available for investment as a result of funding various acquisitions and stock repurchase programs during the year 
the increase of million interest income in fiscal was primarily due to higher cash balances as a result of proceeds insilicon received from the initial public offering of insilicon stock 
gain loss on investment gain loss on investment was million  nil  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
equity investments in companies in which phoenix does not have significant influence  which is usual when ownership is less than  are included in other assets 
these investments are accounted for using the cost method 
these investments are assessed for impairment periodically through review of operations and indications of continued viability  such as subsequent rounds of financing 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the deterioration of financial markets and the corresponding effect on company valuations and financing prospects  phoenix recorded million in losses as a result of other than temporary declines in the value of investments in these companies 
we do not participate in subsequent financings for any of the companies we invested in  and we are not obligated or committed in any way to participate in any future financings of these companies 
net loss on investment in fiscal was million resulting from million of write down netted against million of gain on sale of investments 
the net gain on investment in fiscal was mainly related to a sale of xionics common stock  which resulted in a million gain 
provision for income taxes phoenix recorded income tax benefit of million and income tax provisions of million and million  reflecting effective tax rates of   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was lower than the statutory rate due to change of valuation allowance related to insilicon s deferred tax assets and foreign withholding taxes 
phoenix s effective tax rate in fiscal and had been lower than the statutory rate due to various federal and state tax credits and lower tax rates imposed on foreign earnings in certain jurisdictions 
insilicon is not consolidated for federal income tax purposes in fiscal  as phoenix owns less than of insilicon s issued outstanding voting stock 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and is effective for all business combinations completed after june  the adoption did not have a material effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment under certain circumstances  and written off when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas required purchased intangible assets to be amortized over their estimated useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early application is permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march  provided that the first interim period financial statements have not been previously issued 
the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas on its operating results and financial condition 
the unamortized goodwill was million as of september  and the amortization of goodwill was million for fiscal on october   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles board opinion  reporting the results of operations 
this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
this standard also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
the company is currently assessing the potential impact of sfas on its operating results and financial position 
fluctuations in operating results the tables in part ii  item of this form k include selected unaudited quarterly consolidated data for fiscal and this information was derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present this information  when read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of our license fees are subject to a number of factors that make estimating revenues and operating results prior to the end of a quarter uncertain 
while we receive recurring revenues on royalty based license agreements and some agreements contain minimum quarterly royalty commitments  a significant amount of license fees in any quarter is dependent on signing agreements and delivering the licensed software in that quarter 
generally  we experience a pattern of recording or more of our quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter 
we have historically monitored our revenue bookings through regular  periodic worldwide forecast reviews within the quarter 
these reviews keep management informed of areas where additional selling efforts may be needed in order to meet the internal plans and market expectations 
there can be no assurances that this process will result in our meeting revenue expectations 
operating expenses for any year are normally based on the attainment of planned revenue levels for that year and are incurred ratably throughout the year 
as a result  if revenues were less than planned in any period while expense levels remain relatively fixed  our operating results would be adversely affected for that period 
in addition  unplanned expenses could adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses were incurred 
business risks the additional following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating our business 
product development our long term success will depend on our ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products timely and cost effectively that meet the needs of customers in present and emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or in enhancing existing products or that new or enhanced products will meet market requirements 
delays in introducing new products can adversely impact acceptance and revenues generated from the sale of such products 
we have  from time to time  experienced such delays 
our software products and their enhancements contain complex code that may contain undetected errors and or bugs when first introduced 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will not contain errors or bugs that will adversely affect commercial acceptance of such new products or enhancements 
the introduction of new products depends on acceptance of e commerce and adoption of digital devices 
protection of intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  trademark  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our software products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  copyright and trade secret protection for our products may be unavailable or unreliable in certain foreign countries 
we have been issued twenty nine patents with respect to our current product offerings and have sixty five patent applications pending with respect to certain of the products we market 
phoenix maintains an active internal program designed to identify internally developed inventions worthy of being patented 
there can be no assurance that any of the applications pending will be approved and patents issued or that our engineers will be able to develop technologies capable of being patented 
also  as the number of software patents increases  we believe that companies that develop software products may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that our patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by phoenix 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  may be time consuming and expensive to defend  can trigger indemnity obligations owed by us to third parties  and may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
infringement of valid patents or copyrights or misappropriation of valid trade secrets  whether alleged against us  or our customers  and regardless of whether such claims have merit  could also have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
importance of microsoft and intel for a number of years  phoenix has worked closely with leading software and semiconductor companies in developing standards for the pc industry 
we remain optimistic regarding relationships with these industry leaders 
however  there can be no assurance that leading software and semiconductor companies will not develop alternative product strategies that could conflict with our product plans and marketing strategies 
action by such companies may adversely impact our business and results of operations 
presently  there is little overlap or conflict in our product offerings  although these companies now incorporate some functionality that has traditionally resided in the bios 
these leading software and semiconductor companies  in their endeavors to add value  incorporate features or functions provided by phoenix either in the silicon or in the operating system 
therefore  we must continuously create new features and functions to sustain  as well as increase  our software s added value to oems 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts 
attraction and retention of key personnel our ability to achieve our revenue and operating performance objectives will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain technically qualified engineering  sales  marketing  and finance personnel 
in particular  approximately to of our employees are involved in engineering efforts 
semiconductors ip and internet products are based on new and emerging technologies that are different from bios technologies 
the available pool of engineering talent is limited for all four operating segments 
accordingly  failure to attract  retain and grow our research and development teams could adversely affect our business and operating results 
all of our executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
phoenix might not be able to execute its business plan if we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel 
several of our executives and key employees joined phoenix only recently and have had only a limited time to work together 
our management team might not be able to work effectively together or with the rest of our employees to develop our technology and manage our continuing operations 
dependence on key customers  concentration of credit risk the loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
phoenix s customer base includes large oems in the pc  semiconductor and internet markets  system integrator value added reseller  and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  we maintain individually significant receivable balances due from some of them 
if these customers fail to meet guaranteed minimum royalty payments and other payment obligations  our operating results could be adversely affected 
as of september   our largest receivable balance from any one customer represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
as of the filing date  this receivable had been collected 
competition the market for our bios products is very competitive  resulting in downward pricing pressure 
in marketing our bios products  we compete primarily with in house research and development departments of pc manufacturers that may have significantly greater financial and technical resources than ours 
these companies include acer incorporated  compaq computer corporation  dell computer corporation  ibm corporation  and toshiba corporation 
we also compete for system software business with other independent suppliers  ranging from small  privately held companies to acer softech  a division of acer laboratories  inc  a major taiwan chip and motherboard supplier 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully with our current competitors or potential new competitors 
there can be no assurance that intense competition in the industry and particular actions of our competitors will not have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
due to the competitive nature of the business and the overall price pressures within the pc market  we expect that prices on many of our products may decrease in the future and that such price decreases could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the sip industry is very competitive and is characterized by constant technological change  rapid rates of product obsolescence  and frequently emerging new suppliers 
our existing competitors include other merchant semiconductor intellectual property or sip suppliers  such as the inventra division of mentor graphics corporation  synopsys inc  enthink  inc  gain technology corporation  and the vautomation subsidiary of arc cores  inc  and suppliers of asics  such as lsi logic corporation  the asic divisions of ibm corporation  lucent technologies  inc  toshiba corporation  and nec corporation 
we also compete with the internal development groups of large  vertically integrated semiconductor and systems companies  such as intel corporation  motorola inc  cisco systems  inc  and hewlett packard company 
in these companies  sip developed for an individual project sometimes is subject to efforts by the company to be reused in multiple projects 
companies whose principal business is providing design services as work for hire  such as intrinsix corporation  sci worx corporation  parthus technologies plc  and the tality subsidiary of cadence design systems  inc  also provide competition 
in the firstware software area  we compete with individual component software suppliers such as storagesoft  inc  symantec corporation  and other companies that develop diagnostic and repair software  as well as in house solutions 
in the internet and securities business  there are many distribution vehicles for our partners to reach pc end users  including pc oem companies  pc and hardware registration companies and internet web sites 
many have greater resources than phoenix 
the information appliance division competes primarily with research and development departments of software developers that may have significantly greater financial and technical resources than phoenix 
these companies include opentv corporation  wind river systems  inc  liberate technologies  and microsoft corporation 
we also compete for software business with other independent suppliers  ranging from small  privately held companies to in house research and development departments of major oems 
international sales and activities revenues derived from the international operations of our platform enabling division comprises a majority of total revenues 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience significant fluctuations in international revenues 
while the major portion of our license fee or royalty contracts are us dollar denominated  we are entering into a number of contracts denominated in local currencies 
phoenix has sales and engineering offices in germany  japan  korea  taiwan  and china 
our operations and financial results may be adversely affected by factors associated with international operations  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances  political instability in emerging markets  difficulties in attracting qualified employees  and language  cultural and other difficulties managing foreign operations 
recent terrorist attacks on september   the united states was a target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope 
these attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets  and have contributed to downward pressure on stock prices of united states publicly traded companies 
this instability has resulted in a slowdown in the economy 
these attacks may lead to armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states  or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability in the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
volatile market for phoenix stock the market for our stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and will continue to be  subject to fluctuations in response to operating and financial results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or customer contracts by us or our competitors  changes in our or our competitors product mix or product direction  changes in our revenue mix and revenue growth rates  changes in expectations of growth for the pc industry  as well as other events or factors which we may not be able to influence or control 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the market in which phoenix does business  companies with which phoenix competes or relating to it specifically could have an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many small capitalization  high technology companies and have often included factors other than the operating performance of these companies 
certain anti takeover effects our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these include provisions under which members of the board of directors are divided into three classes and are elected to serve staggered three year terms 
rapid change with the internet critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service  potential tax or other government regulation  may affect the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products 
if we are unsuccessful in timely assimilating changes in the internet environment in our business operations and product development efforts  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
business disruptions while phoenix has not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of its products  such viruses could be created and deployed against its products in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investments are in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  or we may suffer a loss in principal if it is forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries were   and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
international sales are primarily from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are often denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the impact from a hypothetical percent appreciation depreciation of the us dollar from september  market rates would be immaterial on our net income 
investment risk we invest in equity instruments of information technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses on these assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in fiscal  after re valuating our investments  we recorded impairment charges of million on these investments 
equity security price fluctuations would have an immaterial negative impact on the value of our securities in fiscal due to our low net equity investment balance at september
