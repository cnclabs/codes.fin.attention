item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
outside the united states  prozac patents generally either have expired or will expire over the next several years 
other us compound patent expirations include those claiming the respective active ingredients in axid   zyprexa   humalog   and reopro  the gemzar compound patent in the us expires in  but a use patent covering treatment of neoplasms with gemzar is in force until we hold a number of us patents covering evista and its approved uses in osteoporosis prevention and treatment that we believe can provide us exclusivity in the united states until at least we are in the process of extending the us compound patent on the active ingredient in evista  but  even if extended  this patent will expire substantially before in the united states  our co promotion agreement with takeda for actos runs until the compound patent for actos expires in  but takeda has applied for patent term extension 
for many of our products  in addition to the compound patent we hold other patents on manufacturing processes  formulations  or uses that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent 
zenith goldline pharmaceuticals  inc  a generic drug manufacturer  has filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration fda seeking permission to market a generic version of zyprexa prior to the expiration of our us patents for the product 
under the federal hatch waxman act of  zenith has filed an anda alleging that the patents listed in our zyprexa new drug application nda are invalid or not infringed 
this allegation is commonly known as a paragraph iv certification 
under the terms of the hatch waxman legislation  any generic manufacturer may file an anda with a paragraph iv certification after the pioneer company has marketed its product for four years 
if one or more of the nda listed patents are successfully challenged  the first filer of a paragraph iv certification may be entitled to a day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers 
we are taking all measures necessary to defend our patents covering zyprexa 
worldwide  we sell all of our major products under trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations 
trademark protection varies throughout the world  with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used  and in other countries as long as it is registered 
registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms 
competition our pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the world 
our animal health products compete on a worldwide basis with products of pharmaceutical  chemical  and other companies that operate animal health divisions or subsidiaries 
important competitive factors include product efficacy  safety and ease of use  price and demonstrated cost effectiveness  service  and research and development of new products and processes 
if competitors introduce new products and processes with therapeutic or cost advantages  our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales  or both 
when we introduce new products with patent protection  they usually must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors 
manufacturers of generic products typically invest far less in research and development than research based pharmaceutical companies  accordingly  they are able to price their products significantly lower than branded products 
therefore  when a branded product loses its market exclusivity  it often faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product 
in many countries outside the united states  patent protection is weak or nonexistent 
in order for us to successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations  we must demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care 
we believe our long term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative products that serve unmet medical needs and are cost effective  together with our ability to manufacture the products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment 
there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products or processes will not become outmoded from time to time as a result of products or processes developed by our competitors 
government regulation for many years our operations have been regulated extensively by the federal government  to some extent by state governments  and in varying degrees by foreign governments 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  other federal statutes and regulations  various state statutes and regulations  and laws and regulations of foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing  approval  production  labeling  distribution  post market surveillance  advertising  dissemination of information  and promotion of our products 
the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing  data analysis  and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market 
promotion  marketing  and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated in all major world markets 
in addition  our operations are subject to complex federal  state  local  and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations 
we anticipate that the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort  time  and expense and significant capital investment 
in the united states  the omnibus budget reconciliation act of requires us to provide rebates to state governments on their purchases of certain of our products under state medicaid programs 
other cost containment measures have been adopted or proposed by federal  state  and local government entities that provide or pay for health care 
in most international markets  we operate in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs  which may include price controls  discounts and rebates  restrictions on physician prescription levels  restrictions on reimbursement  compulsory licenses and generic substitution 
on october   president clinton signed the agriculture  rural development  food and drug administration  and related agencies appropriations act for fiscal year this legislation includes a provision that repeals the federal ban on the reimportation of most prescription drugs by anyone other than the manufacturer 
consequently  under the new law  wholesalers and pharmacists may be permitted to reimport certain drugs approved for sale in the us and originally sold abroad  subject to several conditions 
the law authorizes reimportation from select jurisdictions  including australia  canada  the european union  israel  japan  new zealand  south africa  and switzerland 
before the law takes effect  the secretary of health and human services hhs must demonstrate to congress that the law poses no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant reductions in drug costs for american consumers 
if hhs can make that demonstration  then the fda must draft regulations prior to implementing the law 
in december  the outgoing secretary of hhs stated that she would be unable to make the demonstration required by the law 
it is uncertain what action  if any  may be taken on this bill by the new secretary of hhs or whether congress will modify the legislation 
we expect that governments inside and outside the united states will continue to propose and or adopt a variety of measures to contain health care costs  including pharmaceutical costs 
some of these measures could adversely affect our business 
as an example  there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the state and federal levels intended to provide greater access to drugs for elderly and low income americans 
some of these proposals would  directly or indirectly  impose governmental controls on the prices at which our products are sold 
outside the united states  some proposals would either directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 
we cannot predict whether such proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments 
research and development our commitment to research and development dates back more than years 
our research and development activities are responsible for the discovery or development of most of the products we offer today 
we invest heavily in research and development  which we believe is critical to our long term competitiveness 
at the end of  we employed approximately  people in pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activities  including a substantial number of physicians  scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees  and highly skilled technical personnel 
we expended billion on research and development activities in  billion in  and billion in we concentrate our pharmaceutical research and development efforts in five therapeutic categories central nervous system and related diseases  endocrine diseases  including diabetes and osteoporosis  cancer  cardiovascular diseases  and infectious diseases 
however  we remain opportunistic  therefore  we selectively pursue promising leads in other therapeutic areas 
we are actively engaged in biotechnology research programs involving recombinant dna  proteins  and genomics the development of therapeutics through identification of disease causing genes and their cellular function 
in addition to discovering and developing new chemical entities  we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new uses and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients 
to supplement our internal efforts  we collaborate with independent research organizations  including educational institutions and research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and we contract with others for the performance of research in their facilities 
we use the services of physicians  hospitals  medical schools  and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of new products 
we actively seek out investments in external research and technologies that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own research efforts 
these investments can take many forms  including licensing arrangements  co development and co marketing agreements  joint ventures  and acquisitions 
we also conduct extensive work in the animal sciences  including animal nutrition and physiology and veterinary medicine 
certain of our research and development activities relating to pharmaceutical products may be applicable to animal health products 
an example is the search for agents that will cure infectious disease 
drug development is time consuming  expensive  and risky 
on average  only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine 
the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take more than twelve years 
candidates can fail at any stage of the process  and even late stage product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval 
we believe our investments in research  both internally and in collaboration with others  have been rewarded by the number of new pharmaceutical compounds and indications in all stages of development 
among our new investigational compounds in the later stages of development are potential therapies for sepsis  osteoporosis  depression  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  male erectile dysfunction  various cancers  urinary incontinence  diabetic complications  and infectious diseases 
further  we are studying many other compounds in the earlier stages of development 
we are also developing new uses and formulations for many of our important products  such as zyprexa  gemzar  reopro  and evista 
quality assurance our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness 
the quality of our products arises from the total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations  including research and development  purchasing  facilities planning  manufacturing  and distribution 
we have developed quality assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 
control of production processes involves rigid specifications for ingredients  equipment  facilities  manufacturing methods  packaging materials  and labeling 
we perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to assure that the product meets all regulatory requirements and our standards 
these tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses  microbiological testing  testing in animals  or a combination 
additional assurance of quality is provided by a corporate quality assurance group that monitors existing pharmaceutical and animal health manufacturing procedures and systems in the parent company  subsidiaries  and affiliates 
in march  we received a warning letter from the fda following an agency inspection of one of our manufacturing facilities in connection with our pending application for approval to market a rapid acting intramuscular formulation of zyprexa 
the letter cited several instances of deviations from the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp s 
we are working closely with the agency to implement corrective measures to address the cgmp deficiencies 
we do not currently expect a material financial impact from the issues raised by the warning letter or the corrective measures we are implementing 
however  the timing and nature of the resolution of the cgmp issues will depend on our ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda the quality and reliability of our manufacturing controls and procedures 
the failure to satisfy cgmp requirements established by the fda could lead to delays in the release of products and in the approval of new drug applications  recalls or seizures  and other sanctions

the relative contribution of any particular product to our consolidated net sales changes from year to year 
in addition  the contribution of any particular product to net income is not necessarily the same as its contribution to consolidated net sales 
this is due to several factors  including the introduction of new products by us and by other manufacturers

in addition  changing currency values can either favorably or unfavorably affect our financial position and results of operations 
we actively manage foreign exchange risk through various hedging techniques including the use of foreign currency contracts 
item properties our principal domestic and international executive offices are located in indianapolis 
at december   we owned production and distribution facilities in the united states and puerto rico 
together with the corporate administrative offices  these facilities contain an aggregate of approximately million square feet of floor area dedicated to production  distribution  and administration 
major production sites include indianapolis  clinton and lafayette  indiana  and carolina and mayaguez  puerto rico 
we also lease sales offices in a number of cities located in the united states and abroad 
we own production and distribution facilities in countries outside the united states and puerto rico  containing an aggregate of approximately million square feet of floor space 
major production sites include facilities in the united kingdom  france  spain  ireland  brazil  mexico  and italy 
we lease production and warehouse facilities in puerto rico and several countries outside the united states 
our research and development facilities in the united states consist of approximately million square feet and are located primarily in indianapolis and greenfield  indiana 
our major research and development facilities abroad are located in belgium  germany  and the united kingdom and contain an aggregate of approximately  square feet 
we believe that none of our properties is subject to any encumbrance  easement  or other restriction that would detract materially from its value or impair its use in the operation of the business 
the buildings we own are of varying ages and in good condition 
item legal proceedings prozac patent litigation in barr laboratories  inc barr  a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer  submitted an abbreviated new drug application anda to the us fda seeking to market a generic form of prozac in the united states several years before the expiration of our patents 
barr alleged that our us patents covering prozac are invalid and unenforceable 
the compound patent expired in february and a patent for the method of use of the compound expires in december on april   we filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana seeking a ruling that barr s challenge to our patents is without merit 
in  geneva pharmaceuticals  inc geneva  another generic manufacturer  submitted a similar anda 
on june   we sued geneva in the same court seeking a similar ruling as in the barr suit 
the two suits were consolidated 
on january   the trial court judge for the southern district of indiana granted partial summary judgment in our favor  dismissing the claims of barr and geneva based on the patent doctrines of best mode and double patenting 
on january   barr and geneva agreed to abandon their remaining two claims based on the patent doctrines of anticipation and inequitable conduct in exchange for a payment of million to be shared among barr  geneva  and a third defendant  apotex  inc barr  geneva  and apotex appealed the trial court s january  rulings to the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on august   the court of appeals ruled in favor of our patent but found our patent to be unenforceable for double patenting 
on october  we petitioned for a rehearing by the court of appeals 
the court of appeals has not yet ruled on our petition 
such petitions for rehearing are rarely granted  therefore  there can be no assurance that the court will rehear this matter 
there can also be no assurance that  if the case is accepted for review by the court  the decision invalidating the patent will be reversed 
should we be unsuccessful in overturning the decision upon a rehearing  we would petition the us supreme court for a writ of certiorari 
however  the us supreme court rarely grants such petitions in patent cases 
several other generic manufacturers have also filed andas for generic forms of prozac  challenging one or both of the patents 
in late  zenith goldline pharmaceuticals  inc  teva pharmaceuticals usa  and cheminor drugs  ltd 
together with one of its subsidiaries cheminor filed andas  challenging the patent 
in january  novex pharma  a division of apotex  inc  filed an anda challenging both patents 
later in  cheminor and schein pharmaceuticals  inc each filed an anda for a different dosage form 
in  barr and teva both filed additional andas for the different dosage form  and alphapharm pty 
ltd 
also filed andas for two dosage forms 
we have filed lawsuits in the united states district court of the southern district of indiana seeking rulings that all these challenges to the patent s are without merit

that discussion is incorporated by reference in this section 
other matters we are currently a defendant in a variety of product liability litigation lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and prozac 
in approximately actions  including several with multiple claimants  plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of children or grandchildren of women who ingested des during pregnancy 
in another approximately actions  plaintiffs seek to recover damages as a result of the ingestion of prozac 
in march  the federal trade commission ftc commenced a non public antitrust investigation focusing on the pharmaceutical industry practice of providing discounts or rebates to managed care organizations and certain other purchasers 
we have responded to two subpoenas from the ftc requesting production of certain documents and other discovery responses 
we believe that all of our actions have been lawful and proper and are cooperating with the investigation 
we are also a defendant in other litigation  including product liability and patent suits  of a character regarded as normal to our business 
while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal actions and investigations pending against us  we believe that except as referred to above with respect to the prozac patent litigation  the costs associated with all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period
