the company has grown from million in sales in to million in sales in the company has also moved from being concentrated in the process systems segment to offering a wider array of products  many of which are more focused on the end usage of cryogenic liquids than on the production of these liquids 
the migration of the company s business  from products primarily employed in the production of cryogenic liquids to a broader array of products used throughout the cryogenic liquid gas supply chain  is demonstrated by the historical growth of the applied technologies and distribution and storage businesses 
in  the company s applied technologies segment represented million  or percent  of its sales and million  or percent  of its gross profit 
in  the company s equivalent segment had sales of million  representing percent of the company s sales

the increase in sales was the result of growth in sales for the applied technologies and distribution and storage segments of million and million  respectively  offset by a million decrease in process systems sales 
the applied technologies segment increase in sales was largely driven by the inclusion of certain product lines of mve for the full year  while only included sales subsequent to april additionally  mri cryostat  lng systems and medical oxygen products all showed significant improvements over similar to applied technologies  sales of the distribution and storage segment benefited significantly in by the inclusion of mve for the full year 
the packaged gas and orca micro bulk delivery systems demonstrated significantly improved sales due to several new long term supply agreements with the large industrial gas suppliers

gross profit margin in the distribution and storage segment declined nearly three percentage points  primarily due to poor performance in the cryogenic service division 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense for was million versus million for  an increase of million  or percent 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expense was percent for  up from percent for the increase as a percentage of sales largely reflects the higher marketing costs inherent in the pursuit of sales in the applied technologies segment  and increasing medical and other employee benefit costs

the acquisitions of mve on april  and of northcoast on march  contributed million in incremental sales to the year  improving the sales of both the distribution and storage and applied technologies segments

the market for process systems equipment was very competitive in due to industry consolidations  fixed asset rationalizations and the overall softness in the industrial gas market 
in addition  under utilization of capacity resulted in lower margin percentages 
gross profit margin in the distribution and storage segment in declined approximately percentage points from levels due to lower prices on cryogenic storage tanks  while gross profit margin in the applied technologies segment in increased approximately percentage points from levels  primarily due to favorable pricing on new product sales acquired with mve

in addition  a large heat exchanger order is completing ahead of schedule and ahead of scheduled billings  thereby increasing unbilled revenue for the significant decrease in operating cash flow in was due primarily to the large decrease in operating income from the process systems segment and decreases in customer advances
