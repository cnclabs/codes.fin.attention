item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services in the home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment areas 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home throughout the united states through its approximately branch locations 
management measures operating results on a geographic basis and  therefore  views each branch as an operating segment 
all the branches provide the same services  except that infusion services are not offered in all the geographic markets in which the company operates 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment 
background 
the following strategic initiatives  adopted in july  were designed to improve the company s performance 
the key elements of the strategy were to remain in the core businesses  with an increased emphasis on respiratory therapy  withdraw from unprofitable components of the business  institute a comprehensive cost reduction and capital conservation program  pursue expansion through internal growth and acquisitions  and improve the capital structure of the company 
significant actions taken by management in included the sale of the california component of the infusion therapy service line the infusion sale  the exit of the infusion therapy service line in texas  louisiana  west virginia  western pennsylvania and downstate new york and the consolidation or closure of certain small branch locations throughout the united states 
other significant actions taken in included the termination of plans to proceed with the capital intensive implementation of an enterprise resource planning system  a significant reduction of corporate and regional labor and general administrative costs and the development of a comprehensive plan to capture cost savings in the areas of purchasing  distribution and inventory management 
amendments to apria s credit agreement effected in and resulted in  among other items  the ability to complete up to million in acquisitions and repurchase up to million of apria s common stock 
further  apria has made significant prepayments against its bank loans to reduce long term debt 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues increased to billion in from million in the increase in net revenues is due to volume increases  new contracts with regional and national payors  the acquisition of complementary businesses and price increases in certain managed care agreements 
the increase in revenues in when compared to was due largely to the same sources 
the increase was partially offset by revenues lost in the third quarter exit from the infusion therapy service line in selected areas  the reduction in medicare reimbursement rates in for home oxygen therapy  and the exit from contractual arrangements that were not meeting minimum profitability standards 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in millions respiratory therapy infusion therapy home medical equipment other total net revenues  respiratory therapy 
the respiratory therapy service line increased in by when compared to and increased in when compared to these increases were largely due to a sales focus on the higher margin respiratory service line and the impact of acquisitions consummated in and see liquidity and capital resources business combinations and dispositions 
effective january   the medicare reimbursement rates for home oxygen therapy and respiratory drugs were reduced by and  respectively 
this reduction  which was pursuant to the provisions of the balanced budget act of  was followed by an additional reduction in reimbursement rates for home oxygen therapy in the estimated decrease in and revenues and operating income resulting from these reimbursement reductions was approximately million and million  respectively 
the balanced budget act of also froze consumer price index based increases for medicare reimbursed respiratory therapy services beginning in infusion therapy 
infusion therapy revenues increased in as compared to  largely due to volume increases 
the decrease in infusion therapy revenues in as compared to was directly attributable to the exit of the infusion service line in selected areas that represented approximately million in annual revenues 
the infusion line in was also impacted by the termination of low margin contracts 
these decreases were offset somewhat by growth in the remaining geographic areas in which apria engages in the infusion business 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues increased by in from levels 
this service line increased only nominally because the sales focus was placed on the higher margin respiratory therapy service line 
home medical equipment other revenues decreased by in when compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the sales focus on the higher margin respiratory therapy service line  the termination of low profit contracts and to  a lesser extent  decreases in the medical supply and nursing lines that apria began exiting in late the consumer price index based medicare reimbursement rates for home medical equipment other were also frozen by the balanced budget act of beginning in use of estimates in recording net revenues 
substantially all of apria s revenues are reimbursed by third party payors  including medicare  medicaid and managed care organizations 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required in recording net revenues 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
medicare reimbursement update 
some relief to the freeze on consumer price index based reimbursement increases  that was enacted by the balanced budget act of  was provided through the medicare balanced budget refinement act of with limited reimbursement increases in and the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of provides reinstatement of the full consumer price index based reimbursement increase in for certain durable medical equipment 
during  the secretary of the us department of health and human services wrote to the durable medical equipment regional carriers and recommended  but did not mandate  that medicare claims processors base their payments for covered outpatient drugs and biologicals on pricing schedules other than the average wholesale price listing  which historically has been the industry s basis for drug reimbursement 
the suggested alternative pricing methodology was offered in an effort to reduce reimbursement levels for certain drugs to more closely approximate a provider s acquisition cost  but it would not have covered the costs of preparing  delivering or administering the drugs to the patients 
under current reimbursement schedules  these costs are implicitly covered in the reimbursement for the drug cost 
the healthcare industry has taken issue with the us department of health and human services approach for several reasons  primarily because it fails to consider the accompanying costs of delivering and administering these types of drug therapies 
further  if providers choose to discontinue providing these drugs due to inadequate reimbursement  patient access may be jeopardized 
the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of also delayed the adoption of proposed drug price changes and directed the general accounting office to conduct a thorough study  by september  to examine the adequacy of current payments and to recommend revised payment methodologies 
gross profit 
gross margins were in  in and in much of the increase in and in was attributable to improved pricing negotiated for purchases of inventory  patient service equipment and related goods 
also contributing to the gross profit improvement in both years were increases in the share of higher margin respiratory revenues to total net revenues 
further  during  management implemented standardization initiatives and optimal operating models intended to achieve cost savings and operational efficiencies in the functional areas of purchasing and supply management and inventory management 
the gross margin in reflected a full year s benefit of the related cost savings 
also  the exit from low profit service lines and contracts that commenced in late and continued throughout contributed to the gross margin improvement in and gross margins in were impacted by the following charges recorded at september  million to settle certain procurement contracts  million to provide for oxygen cylinder losses  million to provide for losses and obsolescence in inventory and patient service equipment and million related to the exit of the infusion service line in selected markets 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in when compared to was primarily due to continued improvement in the aging of accounts receivable and increased cash collections 
the decrease in the provision rate versus the rate was largely attributable to an improvement in the aging of accounts receivable which management believes was due to process and system improvements implemented in the preceding years 
see liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts included million to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts due to a change in management s collection policy  million for specific uncollectible accounts and million to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable associated with the infusion sale and other business closures 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses  expressed as percentages of net revenues  were for and  down from in this improvement over was largely attributable to the realization of savings from various cost reduction measures that were effected during  such as labor force reductions and facility consolidations 
further  standardization initiatives implemented in in the functional areas of vehicle fleet and delivery management also improved the selling  distribution and administrative line 
also contributing to the relatively high level of expenses in were the following charges recorded in the third quarter of million loss on the infusion sale  million to record certain costs associated with business closures  million in severance  stay bonuses and other employee costs  and million in lease liability on vacant facilities due to facility consolidation activities 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was due to intangible assets recorded in conjunction with acquisitions that closed in and during the decrease in amortization in versus was due to the write off of impaired goodwill of million in the third quarter of this decrease was partially offset by additional amortization expense that was incurred due to the acquisitions 
see liquidity and capital resources business combinations and dispositions 
impairment of intangible assets 
in  the deterioration in the infusion therapy industry and apria s decision to withdraw from the infusion service line in certain geographic markets served as indicators of potential intangible asset impairment 
other indicators of potential impairment identified by management included the company s depressed common stock price  failure to meet its already lowered financial expectations  the threat of continued medicare reimbursement reductions  government investigations against the company  slower than expected progress in improving its revenue management process  and collection difficulties resulting from reported financial problems within major managed care organizations with which the company does business 
therefore  management conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of the company s recorded intangible assets and considered current and anticipated industry conditions  recent changes in its business strategies  and current and anticipated operating results 
the evaluation resulted in an impairment charge of million which was recorded in the third quarter of the charge included a write off of million in intangible assets associated with the exit of the infusion service line in certain areas 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets were grouped at the branch level  which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent 
a branch location was deemed to be impaired if the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets and goodwill at the branch 
in estimating future cash flows  management used its best estimates of anticipated operating results over the remaining useful life of the assets 
for those branches identified as impaired  the amount of impairment was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the long lived assets and goodwill to the estimated fair value for each branch 
fair value was estimated using a valuation technique based on the present value of the expected future cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets and internally developed software 
one of the actions taken in was the termination of a project to implement an enterprise resource planning system 
as a result  apria wrote off related software and other capitalized costs of million in the third quarter of as part of the decision to terminate the enterprise resource planning project  management evaluated its existing systems to determine their long term viability in the context of apria s overall strategic direction 
it was determined that apria was at some risk in continuing to run the infusion billing system on a platform which is no longer supported by the computer industry 
to mitigate the risk  apria began the process to convert the infusion system to the platform on which the respiratory home medical equipment system operates 
also  apria effected a number of enhancements to the systems that rendered certain previously developed modules obsolete 
further  pharmacy and branch consolidations and closures rendered a variety of computer equipment obsolete 
due to its age and technological obsolescence  it was deemed to have no future value 
as a result of these actions  apria recorded an impairment charge of million at september  apria also recognized additional asset impairments during of million in conjunction with the exited service lines and million related to other facility closures and consolidations 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decreases in and were primarily attributable to the continued reduction in long term debt as partially offset by higher interest rates incurred on the bank loans 
the higher interest rates in as compared to were market driven  while the higher rates in  when compared to  were due to an increase in the margin applied by the bank to market interest rates pursuant to the november amendment and restatement of the credit agreement 
also  interest income decreased in and from the level in because apria s cash balances decreased to million at december  from million at december  this reduction in the cash balance was due primarily to million in aggregate payments made on long term debt in and see liquidity and capital resources long term debt 
income taxes 
income tax expense for was million and represents of income before taxes 
at december  apria had federal net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million  expiring in varying amounts in the years through and various state nols which began expiring in additionally  the company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
management believes that its strategies will result in sufficient taxable income during the carryforward period to utilize substantially all of the nols 
the income tax benefit for amounted to million  which was primarily attributable to the release of the company s million valuation allowance 
income tax expense for amounted to million  which was primarily state taxes payable on a basis other than  or in addition to  taxable income 
the remaining amount of income tax expense included estimated settlement amounts for in progress state tax audits 
certain of these tax expense items resulted in increases to deferred tax assets for which no benefit was recorded in due to offsetting increases to the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the primary reasons for the improvement in operating cash flow in  as compared to  were the increase in income before taxes see discussion above regarding non cash tax benefit in  plus a smaller increase in accounts receivable in exclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts 
income before taxes increased in when compared to  however  operating cash flow decreased due to working capital requirements 
cash used in investing activities increased in and over the level due to increases in business acquisitions and increases in patient service equipment purchases to support the growth in the respiratory service line 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by million during despite an increase in net revenues in  accounts receivable decreased as a result of an increase in cash collections and a decrease in collection periods 
days sales outstanding calculated as of each period end by dividing accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  by the day rolling average of net revenues were days at december  compared to days at december  evaluation of net realizable value 
management performs various analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  the process involves an extensive  balanced evaluation of historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends and operating statistics 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as medicare carrier conditions  the extent of contracted business and business combinations 
further  focused reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed 
management periodically refines the evaluation process to consider any changes in related policies and procedures 
because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on apria s results of operations 
unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
delays  ranging from a day up to several weeks  between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
long term debt 
apria s credit agreement with a syndicate of banks was amended and restated in november  upon execution of which a million permanent repayment of the loan was required 
the remaining indebtedness under the credit agreement was restructured into a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of august  four amendments to the amended and restated credit agreement were executed during and two additional amendments were executed in the most significant revisions to the terms of the credit agreement effected during were pursuant to the sixth amendment that was executed in september this latest amendment increased the revolving credit facility to million  extended the final maturity date to september   increased the aggregate amount of permitted acquisitions and reduced interest rates and commitment fees 
in conjunction with the september amendment  apria made a million payment  of which million was scheduled to be paid on september further  during the fourth quarter of  apria made additional prepayments totaling million 
these latest prepayments were applied against future scheduled quarterly payments  effectively eliminating any repayment requirements until march the amended and restated credit agreement  as further amended by the six amendments  permits apria to elect one of two variable rate interest options at the time an advance is made 
the first option is a rate expressed as plus the higher of the federal funds rate plus per annum or the bank of america reference rate 
the second option is a rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an additional increment of per annum 
the agreement requires payment of commitment fees of on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the amended and restated credit agreement  as further amended by the six amendments  allows apria to make acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of up to million from october  through the final maturity date of the agreement 
at december   apria had million remaining on its acquisition allotment 
also  the agreement  as amended  provides apria with the ability to repurchase up to million of its common stock through the final maturity date  subject to annual limitations 
at december   apria had expended million of its common stock repurchase authority 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of apria s assets and the agreement also imposes numerous restrictions  including  but not limited to  covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  mergers  acquisitions and investments  and restrictions on cash dividends  loans and other distributions 
at december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement 
at december   borrowings under the credit agreement totaled million and outstanding letters of credit totaled million 
business combinations and dispositions 
apria periodically makes acquisitions of complementary businesses in specific geographic markets 
the transactions are accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
goodwill recorded in conjunction with such acquisitions is being amortized over years and covenants not to compete are being amortized over the life of the respective agreements 
the aggregate consideration of the acquisitions that closed during was million cash paid for acquisitions and related contingent consideration totaled million in 
allocation of the total consideration includes million to intangible assets  million to patient service equipment and million to accounts receivable 
during  the aggregate consideration for acquisitions was million cash paid for acquisitions and related contingent consideration totaled million in 
during  management performed an extensive profitability study to identify service lines and or geographic markets as potential candidates for exit 
most significant of the decisions arising from the study was the decision to withdraw from the infusion service line in california  texas  louisiana  west virginia  western pennsylvania and downstate new york 
shortly after apria announced its plans to exit the infusion line in these geographic markets  a buyer emerged for the california locations 
crescent healthcare  inc purchased substantially all the assets and business  excluding accounts receivable  of the california infusion locations 
apria recorded a million loss on the sale in the third quarter of the transition out of the service line in substantially all of the selected areas took place in the fourth quarter of the operations of these infusion locations had revenues of million and gross profits of million in other 
during  apria repurchased  shares of its common stock for  to hold in treasury 
at december   apria had million in cash and cash equivalents 
apria s management believes that cash provided by operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities together with cash invested in its money market account will be sufficient to finance its current operations for at least the next year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk apria currently utilizes no derivative financial instruments that may expose the company to significant market risk 
however  apria is subject to interest rate changes on its variable rate term loan under the company s bank credit agreement that may affect the fair value of that debt and cash flow and earnings 
based on the term debt outstanding at december  and the current market perception  a basis point increase in the applicable interest rates would decrease apria s annual cash flow and pretax earnings by approximately million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in the applicable interest rates would increase annual cash flow and pretax earnings by million
