gross margin segment gross margins as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  commercial and industrial residential service and maintenance communications solutions total company gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  overall gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained constant for the years ended september  and margins remained flat as a result of increased bidders on certain fixed price commercial and industrial and communications solutions projects and the impact such bidders had on margins in these segments  and were further impacted by project delays  project cancellations and decreased productivity following the terrorist attacks of september  gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  overall gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the overall decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily the result of losses recorded on certain fixed price commercial projects  a shift in the mix of work toward lower margin bid work versus negotiated contract work  the completion of certain contracts at lower than planned gross margins and the recording of additional claims reserves for our self insured healthcare plan resulting from a higher level of employee participation 
gross margins decreased in our service and maintenance segment as a result of costs associated with establishing additional service locations broadening the scope of our services which include lower margin services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily results from the occurrence of certain costs incurred in the year ended september  which were not incurred in the year ended september  including the write off  net of recoveries of million of costs associated with the our decision to curtail the development of an information system and the non cash compensation charge of million associated with the restricted stock awards  offset by increased infrastructure costs in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to acquired companies was approximately million 
other increased selling  general and administrative costs primarily resulted from the need for additional infrastructure growth to support operational initiatives  including various incentive awards  claims reserves related to our self insured health insurance plan  the non cash compensation charge associated with the restricted stock awards of million  and the write off  net of recoveries of million of costs associated with the decision to change the technology being used in the development of its information system

as a percentage of revenues  income from operations decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net increased from net expense of million in to million in  primarily as a result of increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of million senior subordinated notes due february  in may interest and other expense  net increased from net expense of million in to million in  primarily as a result of increased interest expense on borrowings to fund our acquisitions and a full twelve months of interest expense on the million senior subordinated notes due february  that were issued in provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill amortization representing a smaller percentage of our income before income taxes in our effective tax rate increased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the higher effective tax rate in is primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill amortization and the non deductible portion of the compensation expense associated with the restricted stock awards in representing a larger percentage of our income before income taxes in liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  borrowings of million under our credit facility  million of letters of credit outstanding  and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of million 
during the year ended september   we generated million of net cash from operating activities 
this net cash from operating activities is comprised of net income of million  increased by million of non cash items and decreased by million in working capital changes 
non cash items included depreciation and amortization expense  restricted stock compensation charges  provision for allowance for doubtful accounts  changes in deferred income taxes and gains on sales of property and equipment 
working capital changes consisted of a million decrease in receivables as a result of the timing of collections offset by a million decrease in payables and further decreased by a million increase in prepaids and other current assets  with the balance of the change due to other working capital changes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million of capital expenditures and million of investments in marketable securities and other 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  resulting primarily from the offering of the senior subordinated notes  net of repayments on the credit facility 
on may   we replaced our million credit facility with a new million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lending institutions to be used for working capital  capital expenditure  acquisitions and other corporate purposes that matures may  amounts borrowed under our credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to either a the london interbank offered rate libor plus percent to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda as defined in our credit facility or b the higher of i the bank s prime rate or ii the federal funds rate plus percent plus an additional percent to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
commitment fees of percent are assessed on any unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
our existing and future subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under our facility  and our facility is secured by the capital stock of those subsidiaries  our accounts receivable and the accounts receivable of those subsidiaries 
borrowings under our credit facility are limited to of outstanding receivables as defined in the agreement 
our credit facility requires the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration  prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock  restricts our ability to repurchase shares of common stock  to incur other indebtedness and requires us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including certain financial covenants 
among other restrictions  the financial covenants include minimum net worth requirements  a maximum total consolidated funded debt to ebitda ratio  a maximum senior consolidated debt to ebitda ratio  and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million on our credit facility 
on january  and may   we completed our offerings of million and million senior subordinated notes  respectively 
the offering completed on may   yielded million in proceeds  net of a million discount and million in offering costs 
the proceeds from the may   offering were used primarily to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
the notes bear interest at and will mature on february  we pay interest on the notes on february and august of each year 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of our subsidiaries 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on additional indebtedness  and restrictions on liens  guarantees and dividends 
all of our operating income and cash flows are generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries  which are the subsidiary guarantors of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the separate financial statements of the subsidiary guarantors are not included herein because i the subsidiary guarantors are all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company  ii the subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed the senior subordinated notes  iii the aggregate assets  liabilities  earnings  and equity of the subsidiary guarantors is substantially equivalent to the assets  liabilities  earnings and equity of the company on a consolidated basis  and iv the presentation of separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the subsidiary guarantors is not deemed material 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap contract that has a notional amount of million and was established to manage the interest rate risk of the senior subordinated note obligations 
at september   the fair value of this derivative was million and is included in other noncurrent assets 
under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives  the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap contract is recorded with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged instrument and is thus included in the senior subordinated notes classification as of september  outlook 
economic conditions across the country  especially subsequent to the terrorist attacks of september  are extremely challenging 
to improve our position for continued success  we have taken steps to reduce costs 
we have made significant cuts in selling  general and administrative costs resulting in a to cost reduction at the corporate office and have targeted a to cost reduction in the field 
in connection with these cuts  we will incur associated costs of approximately million to million in our first fiscal quarter of we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and proceeds from our credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment through the next twelve months 
further  based on current internal projections  we expect to be in compliance with our debt instruments through at least the next twelve months 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
seasonality and cyclical fluctuations our results of operations from residential construction are seasonal  depending on weather trends  with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter 
the commercial and industrial aspect of our business is less subject to seasonal trends  as this work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather 
our service and maintenance business is generally not affected by seasonality 
in addition  the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical 
our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions 
quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects and acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period 
inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in fiscal  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results in those fiscal years  or on any of the acquired businesses during similar periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab reflects the basic principles of revenue recognition in existing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
sab does not supersede any existing authoritative literature 
we recognize revenue from construction contracts on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our results of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
and  was effective for ies on october  these statements require that all derivative instruments such as an interest rate swap contract  be recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the criteria for cash flow and fair value hedges require that hedging relationships must be designated and documented upon inception 
the documentation must include the consideration of the hedged item  the specific risk being hedged  identification of the hedging instrument  the company s risk management strategy  and how effectiveness will be assessed 
the effectiveness assessment must have a historical basis that supports the assertion that the hedge will be effective prospectively 
at the date of adoption  there was no financial impact on our consolidated financial statements as we were not a party to any derivative instruments 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap contract to manage specific interest rate risks 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
establishes new standards for accounting and reporting requirements for business combinations and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also requires that acquired intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they meet one of two specified criteria 
additionally  the statement adds certain disclosure requirements to those required by apb  including disclosure of the primary reasons for the business combination and the allocation of the purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption 
this statement is required to be applied to all business combinations initiated after june  and to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july  or later 
use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 which must be applied to fiscal years beginning after december   modifies the accounting and reporting of goodwill and intangible assets 
the pronouncement requires entities to discontinue the amortization of goodwill  reallocate all existing goodwill among its reporting segments based on criteria set by sfas no 
and perform initial impairment tests by applying a fair value based analysis on the goodwill in each reporting segment 
any impairment at the initial adoption date shall be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequent to the initial adoption  goodwill shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
under sfas no 
 entities are required to determine the useful life of other intangible assets and amortize the value over the useful life 
if the useful life is determined to be indefinite  no amortization will be recorded 
for intangible assets recognized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the useful life should be reassessed 
other intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment in a manner similar to goodwill 
at september   our net goodwill was approximately million  and annual amortization of such goodwill was approximately million 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
for our first fiscal quarter of we believe the impairment charge upon adoption will be material  and based on current market capitalization could equate to a substantial amount of our recorded goodwill 
we do not believe this adoption will impact our free cash flows  our operating income or compliance with our debt instruments 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of assessing the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations

we are not exposed to any significant market risks from commodity price risk or foreign currency exchange risk 
our exposure to significant market risks include outstanding borrowings under our floating rate credit facility and interest rate risks resulting from the use of an interest rate swap contract that we entered into in august management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
as a result  our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates
