item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations percentage of sales sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research  development and engineering other sales vs 
sales in fiscal increased  or  as compared to fiscal this increase in sales occurred in the first half of fiscal  primarily a result of increases in the hearing and medical business  as well as mexico and laminate sales  which were offset to a lesser extent by a decrease in cross revenues as a result of a decline in sales to a significant customer early in the year 
during the year  the company continued to diversify its customer base with the largest customer in fiscal representing of revenue compared to in fiscal vs 
sales in fiscal increased  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily in the hearing aid market for microelectronics 
each division microelectronics  cross technology  mexico and high density interconnect contributed to the growth in sales 
the largest customer accounted for of sales in the reason for the decrease in the percentage of sales to the company s largest customer is primarily due to the diversification of the company s customer base as well as the start up of operations in mexico 
gross profit vs 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to start up costs in the prior year for the high density interconnect division  which were offset by higher operating losses for the mexico division  which was closed in the third quarter of fiscal vs 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower margin sales for the company s mexico division and cross operations and start up costs for the high density interconnect facility 
the lower margins for the company s mexico division are primarily a result of higher material content on revenue and lower than anticipated sales volumes 
operating expenses vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by in fiscal  which is a result of higher costs in fiscal from implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system and 
table of contents start up costs related to the high density interconnect division 
in fiscal  the company expects a decrease in selling  general and administrative costs in total dollars and as a percent of sales 
research  development and engineering costs have increased in fiscal by  or  compared to fiscal the increase is a result of an emphasis on new product development  especially in the broadband communications market  as well as new process and product development in all focus markets 
unusual charges of  in fiscal relates to the write off of accounts receivable related to customers of the mexico operations of  in the second quarter and of costs associated with the shut down of the mexico operations in the third quarter 
the closing of the mexico division is a result of the loss from operations for fiscal of approximately  including the write off of accounts receivable and closure costs 
the continuing revenue base in mexico was unable to support the business and was not meeting our requirements for profitability 
in fiscal  other operating costs of are acquisition transaction costs related to the acquisition of cross in march vs 
fiscal selling  general and administrative and research  development and engineering expenses increased  or  over the previous year 
this increase was due to increased selling costs to develop new business and support new operations  non capitalizable costs associated with implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system and start up costs related to the high density interconnect division which are expensed as incurred and increased development costs to support future business opportunities 
in addition to these costs  the company incurred of acquisition transaction costs related to the acquisition of cross in march other income expense  net vs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company wrote off its equity investment in micro substrates corporation msc 
including this write off  expenses incurred related to msc for fiscal were other expense in fiscal of increased as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher interest expense  as a result of decreased average cash balances and increased short and long term debt throughout fiscal  partially offset by interest on loans receivable 
the company expects that other income expense for fiscal will be lower than fiscal as a result of the increased cash from the private placement that was completed in august and the general decrease in interest rates 
vs 
other income expense decreased to a net expense of in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower investment balances and increased short and long term debt resulting in higher interest costs 
income tax expense benefit vs 
the income tax benefit of in fiscal increased over fiscal by the increase is a result of the larger loss before income taxes in the current year 
the effective tax rate of in fiscal is lower than the federal and state statutory tax rate due to the loss on the msc investment  which created a capital loss 
the realization of the capital loss will not occur until the company generates capital gains 
as it is more likely than not that such capital gains will not occur  the company has placed a valuation allowance of on the deferred tax asset arising from the msc capital loss 
vs 
the income tax benefit in fiscal of increased by from the income tax expense of in fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal are and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate is largely a result of the non deductible nature of the acquisition costs related to the cross technology acquisition in fiscal net income loss vs 
the company had a net loss of  in fiscal compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the net loss in fiscal was primarily a result of the operating loss and closure of the mexico 
table of contents operations  including the accounts receivable write off  and the impairment charge for msc 
excluding mexico and msc  the net loss for fiscal was vs 
the company had a net loss of  in fiscal compared to net income of in fiscal the loss in fiscal was a result of lower gross profit and higher expenses associated with the ramp up of the mexico and high density interconnect facilities  erp implementation costs  the cross acquisition costs and higher debt 
financial condition the company s net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended august  was  the cash flow generated was a result of improvements in the key working capital accounts of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable  which resulted in  with operating results contributing the decrease in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable is attributable primarily to the decrease in revenue over the last half of the fiscal year as compared to the comparable prior year period 
accounts receivable average days outstanding was days at august  compared to days at august  inventory turns were and for the years ended august  and  respectively 
the increased days outstanding and decreased inventory turns were primarily due to the slow down in revenue in the last half of the fiscal year  as well as a general slow down in customer payment practices throughout the industry 
the current ratio at the end of fiscal was as compared to at the end of fiscal the increased current ratio is principally due to increased cash and cash equivalents and reduced outstanding revolving line of credit balances as a result of the  private placement of common stock completed in august the company has a maximum of  available under the revolving line of credit  based on the accounts receivable balance outstanding  and a  capital expenditure term loan which both expire in august see notes and under notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of august   there were and  of borrowings under the line of credit and capital expenditure term loan  respectively 
approximately  of the capital expenditure term loan will be available for use by the company after the company meets certain financial covenants  which are calculated monthly  in fiscal and beyond 
the company s long term debt is subject to certain restrictive financial covenants  including but not limited to  tangible net worth  interest coverage  debt service coverage  annual loss limitations and the ability to declare or pay dividends 
losses associated with the mexico operations and the general economic slowdown in the hearing  rfid access and other electronic contract manufacturing markets that the company operates in have resulted in adverse operating results in fiscal due to these adverse operating results  the company was not in compliance with the interest coverage ratio  debt service coverage ratio and year to date net loss covenants at august  the company has amended the agreement with the financial institution  which waives the events of default at august  and amends the covenants for fiscal based on current projections  the company believes that it will meet the bank covenants going forward and has classified the debt per the terms of the respective agreements 
during fiscal  the company purchased  of property and equipment  primarily for production equipment to prepare for production orders for the company s broadband products 
these purchases were funded through cash flow from operations and utilization of the capital expenditure term loan 
during fiscal  the company intends to expend approximately  for manufacturing and facility improvements and capital equipment 
these additions will increase manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated production requirements and add technological capabilities 
it is expected that these expenditures will be funded from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents and available debt financing 

table of contents the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  current lending capacity and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient cash flow for the company to meet its short and long term debt obligations and operating requirements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in thousands the company is exposed to certain market risks with its  revolving line of credit  capital expenditure loans and  to a lesser extent  its industrial development bonds idrbs 
at august   the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit  capital expenditure loans and idrbs were   and  respectively 
the revolving line of credit agreement bears interest  at the company s option  at above the prime rate of interest or above the libor rate 
the capital expenditure loans bears interest  at the company s option  at above the prime rate of interest or above the libor rate 
at august  the interest rates on the revolving commitment and capital expenditure loans were and  respectively 
the idrbs bear interest at a rate  which varies weekly  based on comparable tax exempt issues  and is limited to a maximum rate of 
at june  the interest rate on the idrbs was 
consequently  the company is exposed to a change in borrowing costs as interest rates change 
we have completed a market risk sensitivity analysis of these debt instruments based upon an assumed increase in interest rates at august  if market interest rates had increased by on august   this would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately over a one year period 
because this is only an estimate  any actual change in expense due to a change in interest rates could differ from this estimate 
risk factors in thousands except per share amounts this annual report contains forward looking statements that are based on the company s current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that may materially affect revenues  expenses and operating results include  without limitation  adverse business or market conditions  the ability of the company to secure and satisfy customers  the availability and cost of materials from suppliers  adverse competitive developments  and change in or cancellation of customer requirements 
the forward looking statements included herein are based on current assumptions that the company will continue to develop  market  manufacture and ship products on a timely basis  that competitive conditions within the company s markets will not change materially or adversely  that the company will continue to identify and satisfy customer needs for products and services  that the company will be able to retain and hire key personnel  that its equipment  processes  capabilities and resources will remain competitive and compatible with the current state of technology  that risks due to shifts in customer demand will be minimized  and that there will be no material adverse change in the company s operations or business 
assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments that are based on incomplete information and are subject to many factors that can materially affect results 
the company operates in a volatile segment of high technology markets and applications that are subject to rapid change and technical obsolescence 
because of these and other factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the following factors also may materially affect results and therefore should be considered 
our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop new products and services 
our products are subject to rapid obsolescence and our future success will depend upon our ability to develop new products and services that meet changing customer and marketplace requirements 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify new product and service opportunities  or develop and introduce new products and services to market in a timely manner 
if we are unable to accomplish these tasks  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if we fail to properly anticipate the market for new products and services 
even if we are able to successfully identify  develop  and introduce new products and services  there is no assurance that a market for these products and services will materialize to the size and extent that we anticipate 
if a market does not materialize as we anticipate  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the following factors could affect the success of our products and services in the microelectronic and other marketplaces the failure of our business plan to predict accurately the rate at which the market for microelectronic products and services will grow  the failure of our business plan to predict accurately the types of products and services the future microelectronic marketplace will demand  our limited experience in specific market segments in marketing our products and services  the failure of our business plan to predict accurately our future participation in the microelectronic marketplace  the failure of our business plan to predict accurately the estimated sales cycle  price and acceptance of our products and services  the development by others of products and services that render our products and services noncompetitive or obsolete  or our failure to keep pace with the rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service introductions that characterize the microelectronic marketplace 
the sales cycle for our products and services is lengthy and unpredictable  and we may fail to adequately adjust our expenses to predicted revenue in any given period or we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue 
while our sales cycle varies from customer to customer  it typically has ranged from two to months 
our pursuit of sales leads typically involves an analysis of our prospective customer s needs  preparation of a written proposal  one or more presentations and contract negotiations 
our sales cycle may also be affected by a prospective customer s budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which we have little or no control 
as a result of these things  we may fail to adequately adjust our expenses to predicted revenue in any given period or we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue 
our business may suffer if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights 
there is no assurance that these agreements  provisions and laws will be adequate to prevent the imitation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary systems and products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which infringement of our intellectual property exists  we expect infringement to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our products to the same extent that the laws of the united states protect our products 
if our intellectual property rights are not protected our business may suffer  which could cause our stock price to decline 
furthermore  even if the agreements  provisions and intellectual property laws prove to be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may develop products or technologies that are both non infringing and substantially equivalent or superior to our products or technologies 
third party intellectual property infringement claims may be costly and may prevent the future sale of our products 
substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry 
third parties may claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
any such claim may have a material adverse affect on our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
in particular  defending against third party infringement claims may be costly and divert important management resources 
furthermore  if these claims are successful  we may have to pay substantial royalties or damages  remove the infringing products from the marketplace or expend substantial amounts in order to modify the products so that they no longer infringe on the third party s rights 

table of contents we may pursue future acquisitions and investments that may adversely affect our business 
in the future we may continue to make acquisitions of and investments in businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand our business 
such acquisitions  though  involve certain risks we may not be able to identify or make strategic acquisitions 
we may not be able to negotiate or finance the acquisition successfully 
the integration of acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business may fail 
we may issue equity securities  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets  which could cause our earnings per share to decline 
our business may be adversely affected if our customers are unable to gain market acceptance for the products we develop or manufacture for them 
we design and manufacture components for other companies 
we also sell proprietary products that contain components to other companies and end user customers 
for products we manufacture manufactured for others or those we sell directly  our success is dependent on the acceptance of those products in their markets 
market acceptance may depend on a variety of factors  including educating the target market regarding the use of a new procedure 
market acceptance and market share are also affected by the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
some of our customers  especially emerging growth companies  have limited or no experience in marketing their products and may be unable to establish effective sales and marketing and distribution channels to rapidly and successfully commercialize their products 
if our customers are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for the products we develop or manufacture for them  our business will be adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  substantial fines could be imposed on us  and we could be required to suspend production  alter manufacturing processes or cease operations 
our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if our products or the products that incorporate our products are deemed to pose health risks 
news reports have asserted that power levels associated with hand held cellular telephones and infrastructure equipment may pose health risks 
if it were determined or perceived that electromagnetic waves carried through wireless communications equipment create a health risk  the market for our wireless customers products could be severely reduced  which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  if wireless communications systems or other systems or devices that rely on or incorporate our products are determined or alleged to create a health risk  we could be named as a defendant  and held liable  in product liability lawsuits  which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if the products we design and manufacture are the subject of product recalls or product liability claims 
a number of the components we design or manufacture are for medical devices 
the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture or use of these products may be small or nonexistent 
if a component we designed or manufactured is found to be defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  to improper use of the product or to other reasons  the component or the product in which it is used may need to be recalled  possibly at our expense 
furthermore  the adverse effect of a product recall on our business might not be limited to the cost of the recall 
recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in substantial costs  loss of revenues and damage to our reputation  each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
future quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced substantial fluctuations in our annual and quarterly operating results  and such fluctuations may continue in 
table of contents future periods 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following we may manufacture products that are custom designed and assembled for a specific customer s requirement in anticipation of the receipt of volume production orders from that customer  which may not always materialize to the degree anticipated  if at all  we may incur significant start up costs in the production of a particular product  which costs are expensed as incurred and for which we attempt to seek reimbursement from the customer  we may experience fluctuations and inefficiencies in managing inventories  fixed assets  components and labor  in the degree of automation used in the assembly process  in the costs of materials  and the mix of materials  labor  manufacturing  and overhead costs  we may experience unforeseen design or manufacturing problems  price competition or functional competition other means of accomplishing the same or similar packaging end result  we may be unable to pass on cost overruns  we may not have control over the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and the range of services provided  and we may experience variance in the amount and timing of orders placed by a customer due to a number of factors  including inventory balancing  changes in manufacturing strategy  and variation in product demand attributable to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive factors  and general economic conditions 
any one of these factors  or a combination of one or more factors  could adversely affect the company s annual and quarterly operating results  which in turn may cause our stock price to decline 
our customers generally require short delivery cycles and a substantial portion of our backlog is typically scheduled for delivery within days 
quarterly sales and operating results therefore depend in large part on the volume and timing of bookings received during or immediately prior to the quarter  which are difficult to forecast in advance of that time 
the short lead time for our backlog also affects its ability to accurately project production and inventory levels 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
any inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any revenue shortfall may magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our operating results 
we are dependent on a single industry  and our business and revenues may be adversely affected by trends in that industry 
during the past several years  we have been significantly dependent on a single market 
in fiscal  of our revenues came from sales to hearing instrument and medical manufacturers 
these industries are characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles  rapid technological change  significant fluctuations in product demand and significant pressure on vendors to reduce or minimize cost 
accordingly  we may be adversely affected by these industry trends to the extent that they reduce our revenues 
in particular  if the hearing instrument manufacturers develop new technologies that do not incorporate our products  or if our competitors offer similar products at a lower cost to such manufacturers  our revenues may decrease and our business would be adversely affected 
although we are attempting to reduce our dependence on a single industry  we do not expect this historic dependence to change dramatically or quickly 
moreover  a significant amount of our non hearing instrument industry sales are made in the medical products industry  which is characterized by trends similar to those in the hearing instrument manufacturer industry 
our customer base is highly concentrated and our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the loss of a key customer 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
in fiscal  and  our two largest customers  siemens ag and sonic innovations  inc  in the aggregate accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales 
each of these customers has multiple programs in production with us 
although we are reducing this concentration  we expect that sales to a relatively small 
table of contents number of original equipment manufacturers will continue to account for a substantial portion of net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a decline in orders from  any one of our key customers would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are working for diversification such that no one market would account for or more in revenue  no one customer at or greater revenue and no one program at or greater 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business and operating results may be adversely affected if we fail to compete successfully 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against several domestic and foreign providers of similar microelectronics design and or manufacturing services 
we also face competition from the internal operations of our current and potential original equipment manufacturer customers and from offshore contract manufacturers  which  because of their lower labor rates and other related factors  may enjoy a comparative advantage over us with respect to high volume production 
we expect to continue to encounter competition from other electronics manufacturers that currently provide or may begin to provide contract design and manufacturing services 
a number of our competitors may have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we have  and may offer a broader scope and presence of operations on a worldwide basis 
significant competitive factors in the microelectronics market include price  quality  design capabilities  responsiveness  testing capabilities  the ability to manufacture in very high volumes and proximity to the customers final assembly facilities 
while we have competed favorably in the past with respect to these factors  this is a particularly fast changing market  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
we are often one of two or more suppliers on any particular customer requirement and are  therefore  subject to continuing competition on existing programs 
in order to remain competitive in any of our markets  we must continually provide timely and technologically advanced design capabilities and manufacturing services  ensure the quality of our products  and compete favorably with respect to turnaround and price 
if we fail to compete favorably with respect to the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve  our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of components 
substantially all of the our manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis in which we  in addition to providing design  assembly and testing services  are responsible for the procurement of the components that are assembled by us for our customers 
although we attempt to minimize margin erosion as a result of component price increases  in certain circumstances we are required to bear some or all of the risk of such price fluctuations  which could adversely affect our profits 
to date  we have generally been able to negotiate contracts that allow us to shift much of the impact of price fluctuations to the customer  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in all cases 
in order to assure an adequate supply of certain key components that have long procurement lead times  such as integrated circuits  we occasionally must order such components prior to receiving formal customer purchase orders for the assemblies that require such components 
failure to accurately anticipate the volume or timing of customer orders can result in component shortages or excess component inventory  which in either case could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
certain of the assemblies manufactured by us require one or more components that are ordered from  or which may be available from  only one source or a limited number of sources 
delivery problems relating to components purchased from any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 
from time to time  our suppliers allocate components among their customers in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times there have been industry wide shortages of electronic components 
while we have not experienced sustained periods of shortages of components in the recent past  there can be no assurance that substantial component shortages will not occur in the future 
any such shortages could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents our operating results may be adversely affected by the costs associated with our inability to forecast customer orders and production schedules 
the level and timing of orders placed by customers vary due to the customers attempts to balance their inventory  changes in customers manufacturing strategies  and variations in demand for the customers products 
due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules more than several weeks in advance of requirements 
our inability to forecast the level of customers orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and optimize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and incur other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demands of our customers 
from time to time  anticipated orders from some of our customers have failed to materialize and delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customer s business needs  both of which have adversely affected our operating results 
on other occasions  customers have required rapid increases in production that have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar fluctuations in customer demand in the future 
our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the inability of our customers to pay their accounts 
we may carry significant accounts receivable in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our principal customers were to become insolvent  or otherwise fail to pay for the services and materials provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop technologies that meet the rapidly evolving market requirements of our customers 
our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change and short product life cycles 
in particular  the hearing  medical and telecommunications markets are prone to rapid product obsolescence by new technologies 
the microelectronics industry could experience future competition from new or emerging technologies that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete 
our inability to develop technologies or acquire capability to meet the evolving market requirements of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition  including our ability to maintain our revenue base 
our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if our growth is not managed properly 
our sales have varied significantly as customer demand for our products fluctuate 
our future operating results will depend on management s ability to manage periods of both growth and downturn  to be able to hire  train and retain the appropriate number of qualified employees  and to forecast revenues and control expenses 
unexpected declines in revenues  without corresponding and timely reductions in expenses  may materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business success may be adversely affected by our ability to hire and retain employees 
our continued growth and success depend to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
competition for skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting new personnel and retaining existing personnel 
none of our employees are subject to a long term employment agreement  although several key employees are subject to non competition agreements 
the loss of one or more key employees may materially adversely affect our growth 
our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to secure additional financing  at terms acceptable to us  when needed 
in august  we received gross proceeds in the amount of  from a private placement of our common stock 
the net proceeds from this private placement are expected to fund our operations through fiscal we intend to create new marketing programs  hire additional personnel and increase sales as part of our growth strategy 
in addition  we will consider the acquisition of complementary or additional businesses or products that our management believes meet our current or future business objectives 
we may require additional capital to finance future growth or strategic acquisitions 
required additional capital could come from a number of sources including sales of additional shares of capital stock or other securities or loans from banks or other sources 
there is no assurance that additional financing will be available to us if needed or  if available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by significant price fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the market price of the common stock may be significantly affected by many factors  including changes in requirements or demands for our services  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors operating results  changes in prices of our or our competitors products and services  changes in our revenue and revenue growth rates  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts  speculation in the press or analyst community  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
the stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their operating performance 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage lawsuits and other claims against our directors 
our articles of incorporation provide  to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law  that our directors shall have no personal liability for breaches of their fiduciary duties to us 
in addition  our bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law 
these provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their duty 
our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
we have not  however  provided a valuation allowance for any deferred tax assets because we believe that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
realization of these assets is dependent on our achieving profitability levels sufficient to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
the write off of this asset may be required if we determine that we are unable to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards 
a write off of this asset could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we have issued numerous options to acquire our common stock that could have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
as of october   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of our common stock  exercisable at prices ranging from to per share  with a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share 
during the terms of these options  the holders will have the opportunity to profit from either an increase in the market price of our common stock with resulting dilution to the holders of shares who purchased shares for a price higher than the respective exercise or conversion price 
in addition  the increase in the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of the exercise or conversion of these options could result in a significant decrease in the percentage ownership of our common stock by the purchasers of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by future sales of our common stock in the public market 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market that are not currently freely tradable  or even the potential for such sales  could have an adverse effect on the market price for shares of our common stock and could impair the ability of purchasers of our common stock to recoup their investment or make a profit 
as of october   these shares consist of approximately  shares owned by our executive officers and directors of our outstanding common stock  and approximately  shares issuable to option holders 

table of contents unless the shares of our outstanding common stock owned by our executive officers and directors are further registered under the securities laws  they may not be resold except in compliance with rule promulgated by the sec  or some other exemption from registration 
rule does not prohibit the sale of these shares but does place conditions on their resale which must be complied with before they can be resold 
our business and financial condition may be adversely affected if future sales of our common stock in the public market limit our ability to raise equity capital 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market pursuant to rule  upon exercise or conversion of derivative securities or otherwise  or even the potential for such sales  could affect our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
if we are unable to raise capital through the sale of equity securities  we may not be able to fund operations or finance our growth strategy and may not be able to continue certain marketing programs  hire or retain certain employees  increase sales or acquire certain businesses or products 
the inability to continue with any one or a combination of these items may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
provisions in our articles of incorporation allow us  without obtaining shareholder approval  to issue additional shares of stock that may reduce the value of the common stock or inhibit a third party acquisition without obtaining shareholder approval 
our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of common stock and  shares of undesignated stock  the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors  without further action by our shareholders 
undesignated stock authorized by the board of directors may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemptive rights and sinking fund provisions 
if the board of directors authorizes the issuance of preferred stock in the future  this authorization could affect the rights of the holders of our common stock  thereby reducing the value of our common stock  and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if a majority of the holders of our common stock approved of an acquisition 
we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future
