overview we buy and hold equity interests in mid sized investment management firms our affiliates and currently derive all of our revenues from those firms 
we hold investments in affiliates that in aggregate managed billion in assets at december  our most recent investment was in frontier capital management company  llc in january we have a revenue sharing arrangement with each of our affiliates which allocates a specified percentage of revenues  typically  for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses  including salaries and bonuses  which we refer to as the operating allocation 
the remaining portion of revenues of each such affiliate  typically  is referred to as the owners allocation  and is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including amg  generally in proportion to their ownership of the affiliate 
in certain cases our profit distribution is paid to us in the form of a guaranteed payment for the use of our capital or a license fee  which in each case is paid from the owners allocation 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for the managers of these affiliates by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenues  which may increase their compensation from the operating allocation  and profit distributions from the owners allocation  and to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation which is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
under the revenue sharing arrangements  the managers of our affiliates have incentives both to increase revenues of the affiliate thereby increasing the operating allocation and their share of the owners allocation and to control expenses of the affiliate thereby increasing the excess operating allocation 
the revenue sharing arrangements allow us to participate in the revenue growth of our affiliates because we receive a portion of the additional revenue as our share of the owners allocation 
however  we participate in that growth to a lesser extent than the managers of our affiliates  because we do not share in the growth of the operating allocation 
under the organizational documents of the affiliates  the allocations and distributions of cash to us generally take priority over the allocations and distributions to the other owners of the affiliates 
this further protects us if there are any expenses in excess of the operating allocation of an affiliate 
thus  if an affiliate s expenses exceed its operating allocation  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s management owners  until that portion is eliminated  and then reduce the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of future affiliate management owners allocation 
unlike all other affiliates  the managers funds llc is not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement since we own substantially all of the firm 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenues or expenses of managers 
the portion of our affiliates revenues which is included in their operating allocation and retained by them to pay salaries  bonuses and other operating expenses  as well as the portion of our affiliates revenues which are included in their owners allocation and distributed to us and the other owners of the affiliates  are included as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
the expenses of our affiliates which are paid out of the operating allocation  as well as our holding company expenses which we pay out of the amounts of the owners allocation which we receive from the affiliates  are both included in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
the portion of our affiliates revenues which is allocated to owners of the affiliates other than us through their share of owners allocation is included in minority interest on our consolidated statements of operations 
our revenues are generally derived from the provision of investment management services for fees by our affiliates 
investment management fees or asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management 
certain of the affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears  while mutual fund clients are billed based upon daily assets 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  several of the affiliates charge performance based fees to certain of their clients  these performance based fees result in payments to the applicable affiliate based on levels of investment performance achieved 
while the affiliates bill performance based fees at various times throughout the year  the greatest portion of these fees have historically been billed in the fourth quarter in any given year 
all references to assets under management include assets directly managed as well as assets underlying overlay strategies which we call overlay assets  which employ futures  options or other derivative securities to achieve a particular investment objective 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors including principally the level of affiliate revenues  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  a variety of factors affecting the securities markets generally  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the receipt of owners allocation  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in attracting new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations  including compensation for its employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject 
in addition  our profitability will depend upon fees paid on the basis of investment performance at certain affiliates 
fees based on investment performance are inherently dependent on investment results  and therefore may vary substantially from year to year 
in particular  performance based fees were of an unusual magnitude in and  but were not as significant in  and may not recur even to the same magnitude as in future years  if at all 
in addition  while the performance based fee contracts of our affiliates apply to investment management services in a range of investment management styles and securities market sectors  such contracts may be concentrated in certain styles and sectors 
for example  in we benefited from a concentration of such products in technology sectors which performed well in that year but have declined significantly since that time 
to the extent such contracts are concentrated within styles or sectors  they are subject to the continuing impact of fluctuating securities prices in such styles and sectors as well as the performance of the relevant affiliates 
as described above  our revenue is largely from fees based upon our affiliates assets under management  and as of the end of in excess of of that revenue was derived from the equity asset class 
as a result  our revenue is impacted by the performance of the equity markets as a whole 
through the end of the first quarter of  market indices such as the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq composite index had declined significantly 
as with many financial services firms  our results in the first quarter of will be affected adversely by these broad market declines  and our results in the future would be affected adversely by further market declines 
our investments have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under which goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition of interests in affiliates over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including acquired client relationships 
as a result of our investments  intangible assets  consisting of acquired client relationships and goodwill  constitute a substantial percentage of our consolidated assets 
as of december   our total assets were approximately million  of which approximately million consisted of acquired client relationships and million consisted of goodwill 
the amortization period for intangible assets for each investment is assessed individually  with amortization periods for our investments to date ranging from seven to years in the case of acquired client relationships and to years in the case of goodwill 
in determining the amortization period for intangible assets acquired  we consider a number of factors including the firm s historical and potential future operating performance and rate of attrition among clients  the stability and longevity of existing client relationships  the firm s recent  as well as long term  investment performance  the characteristics of the firm s products and investment styles  the stability and depth of the firm s management team  and the firm s history and perceived franchise or brand value 
we regularly perform an evaluation of intangible assets on an investment by investment basis to determine whether there has been any impairment in their carrying value or their useful lives 
if impairment is indicated  then the carrying amount of intangible assets  including goodwill  will be reduced to their fair values 
as a result of our investments  amortization expense  which is a non cash charge  has historically represented a significant percentage of our expenses 
in february  the financial accounting standards board released a proposed accounting standard that  if adopted  would change the accounting for goodwill 
if the standard is adopted  goodwill would no longer be amortized 
since goodwill amortization represented of total intangible amortization expense in the year ended december   under similar circumstances in the future our net income and earnings per share may be higher for this reason 
there can be no assurance that this standard will be adopted in its proposed form  or at all 
even if the pending accounting changes occur  intangible amortization related to acquired client relationships will continue to be a material component of our operating expenses 
accordingly  we believe it is significant to distinguish amortization expense and other non cash expenses principally depreciation from other operating expenses since these expenses do not require the use of cash 
we have provided additional supplemental information in this report for cash related earnings as an addition to  but not a substitute  for measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
our additional measures of cash related earnings are cash net income net income plus depreciation and amortization  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of funds available to the company  which may be used to make new investments  repay debt obligations  repurchase shares of common stock or pay dividends on our common stock although the company has no current plans to pay dividends  ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements  and ebitda contribution ebitda plus our holding company operating expenses  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of funds available from our affiliates operations to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
assets under management were billion at december  versus billion at december  the decrease in assets under management during the year resulted from the net loss of low fee overlay assets of billion  principally from the loss of two passive overlay asset accounts 
negative investment performance of billion also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by our new investments billion of assets under management at the time of investment  including our investment in frontier capital management company  llc  and positive net client cash flows of directly managed assets of million 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in net income resulted primarily from lower performance based fees  partially offset by internal growth of existing affiliates and our investment in frontier 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from the year ended december  revenues excluding performance based fees grew for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in total revenues resulted from an unusual magnitude of performance based fees realized in which did not recur at this level in revenues from performance based fees represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in performance based fees in when compared to was partially offset by the growth in asset based fees at our existing affiliates and from revenues from our investment in frontier 
total operating expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  compensation and related expenses decreased by million to million 
amortization of intangible assets increased by million to million  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  and other operating expenses increased by million to million 
the decrease in operating expenses was principally a result of the net decrease in affiliates operating allocation due to the decrease in performance based fees  partially offset by the increase in mutual fund distribution expenses resulting from the acquisition of the managers funds llc in and the subsequent growth in managers revenues and related distribution expenses in the increase in amortization expense was principally the result of our investment in frontier 
investment and other income decreased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   as a result of the significant levels of income recognized from our interests in affiliate investment partnerships in that did not recur in minority interest decreased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily as a result of the decrease in performance based fees earned in  partially offset by the growth in asset based fees and our investment in frontier 
interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was the result of an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding under our credit facility and increases in libor interest rates 
the increase in weighted average debt outstanding was attributable to our investment in frontier and the repurchase of common stock  partially offset by debt repayments from cash flows from operations 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in income tax expense was related principally to the decrease in income before taxes in the year ended december   as well as a decrease in our effective tax rate from to 
the effective tax rate decreased in as a result of stockholder approval of an incentive compensation plan which increased allowable compensation deductions  among other initiatives 
ebitda decreased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   resulting from the decrease in performance based fees  partially offset by the growth in asset based fees at our existing affiliates and our investment in frontier 
cash net income decreased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a result of the factors affecting net income as described above  excluding the changes in depreciation and amortization during the year 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income resulted primarily from a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates principally essex investment management company  llc  as well as growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance 
in addition  the investments we made in and contributed significantly to our growth 
we invested in essex in march  davis hamilton jackson associates  lp in december  rorer asset management  llc in january and managers in april and included their results from the respective dates of investment 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the year ended december  the increase in revenues resulted from a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates  as well as growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance and investments in new affiliates 
revenues from performance based fees increased from approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  to approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  the increase in performance based fees was primarily the result of performance based fee contracts in place at essex 
total operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  compensation and related expenses increased by million to million  amortization of intangible assets increased by million to million  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  and other operating expenses increased by million to million 
the growth in operating expenses was principally a result of an increase in affiliates operating allocation due to a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates  growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance and investments in new affiliates 
investment and other income increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   substantially from the significant levels of income recognized from our interests in affiliate investment partnerships in minority interest increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in affiliates owners allocation due to a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates  growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance and investments in new affiliates 
interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense resulted from repayments of senior bank debt with the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in march and cash flow from ongoing operations  and was partially offset by borrowings related to new investments 
in addition  interest expense decreased due to the favorable impact of the public offering on our libor margin as well as a favorable interest rate environment 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in income tax expense was related principally to the increase in income before taxes in the year ended december  ebitda increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   resulting from a substantial increase in performance based fees earned by several affiliates  growth in asset based fees resulting from positive investment performance and investments in new affiliates 
cash net income increased by million to million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a result of the factors affecting net income as described above  excluding the changes in depreciation and amortization during the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have met our cash requirements primarily through borrowings from our banks  cash generated by operating activities and the issuance of equity securities in public transactions 
our principal uses of cash have been to make investments  repay indebtedness  pay income taxes  repurchase shares  support our and our affiliates operating activities and for working capital purposes 
we expect that our principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for additional investments  distributions to management owners of affiliates  repayments of debt  including interest on outstanding debt  payment of income taxes  repurchase of shares  capital expenditures  additional investments in existing affiliates  including our purchase of management owners retained equity and for working capital purposes 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of senior debt under our credit facility of million and the ability to borrow an additional million 
we have the option  with the consent of our lenders  to increase the facility by another million to a total of million 
our outstanding senior debt balance as of december  decreased by as compared to december  as a result of repayments from cash flow from ongoing operations  partially offset by borrowings for our investment in frontier capital management company  llc in january and repurchases of shares of our common stock 
during  we began a cash management program with our affiliates that enabled us to access their excess cash through intercompany loans 
at december   we had million in such loans 
because these loans are intercompany balances  they are eliminated for accounting purposes and are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
our borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by pledges of all of our interests in affiliates including all interests which are directly held by us  as well as all interests which are indirectly held by us through wholly owned subsidiaries  which interests represent substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility contains a number of negative covenants  including those which generally prevent us and our affiliates from i incurring additional indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  ii creating any liens or encumbrances on material assets with certain enumerated exceptions  iii selling assets outside the ordinary course of business or making certain fundamental changes with respect to our businesses  including a restriction on our ability to transfer interests in any majority owned affiliate if  as a result of such transfer  we would own less than of such firm  and iv declaring or paying dividends on our common stock 
our credit facility bears interest at either libor plus a margin or the prime rate plus a margin 
we pay a commitment fee on the daily unused portion of the facility 
in order to partially offset our exposure to changing interest rates we have entered into interest rate hedging contracts  as discussed below in market risk 
the credit facility matures during december in order to provide the funds necessary for us to continue to acquire interests in investment management firms  including in our existing affiliates upon the sale by our affiliates management owners of their retained equity to us  it will be necessary for us to incur  from time to time  additional long term bank debt and or issue equity or debt securities  depending on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
net cash flow from operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash flow from operating activities from to resulted principally from the operating cash flows received in from performance based fees earned in the fourth quarter of  and the internal growth of our existing affiliates 
the increase in net cash flow from operating activities from to resulted principally from the internal growth of our existing affiliates 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million and million  respectively  were used to make investments in affiliates 
in january  we acquired our ownership interest in frontier 
in  we acquired our ownership interests in rorer and managers and repaid a note issued in the fourth quarter of in connection with our davis hamilton investment 
in  we acquired a portion of our ownership interest in essex with cash 
all of these investments were financed with borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash flow used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  versus net cash flow from financing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the principal sources of cash from financing activities over the last three years have been borrowings under our credit facility and the public offering of our common stock 
the uses of cash from financing activities during this period were for the repayment of debt and for the repurchase of common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of  with borrowings under our credit facility 
the repurchases were pursuant to two share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october and april each program authorized us to repurchase up to five percent of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions  with the timing of purchases and the amount of stock purchased determined at our discretion 
interest rate sensitivity our revenues are derived primarily from fees that are based on the values of assets managed 
such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are  in part  affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
with respect to our debt financing  we are exposed to potential fluctuations in the amount of interest expense resulting from changing interest rates 
we seek to offset such exposure in part by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
see market risk 
market risk we use interest rate hedging contracts to manage market exposures associated with our variable rate debt by creating offsetting market exposures 
these instruments are not held for trading purposes 
in the normal course of operations  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
as of december   we were a party  with two major commercial banks as counterparties  to million notional amount of interest rate hedging contracts which were linked to the three month libor rate 
we closed these contracts in january in conjunction with the implementation of the new derivative accounting standard  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
during february  we became a party  with two major commercial banks as counterparties  to million notional amount of interest rate hedging contracts that are linked to the three month libor rate 
under these contracts  we have agreed to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the million notional amount 
these contracts cap libor rates on the notional amounts at rates ranging between and 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in the three month libor rates  sustained for three months 
as of march   this analysis indicated that this hypothetical movement in three month libor rates would have resulted in no loss in earnings 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain such hedging contracts at their existing levels of coverage or that the amount of coverage maintained will cover all of our indebtedness outstanding at any such time 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued fas  which standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities and be measured at fair value 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment to fasb statement deferred the effective date of fas to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted the standard on january   and the adoption did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb released a proposed accounting standard that  if adopted  would change the accounting for goodwill 
if the standard is adopted  goodwill would no longer be amortized 
since goodwill represented of total intangible amortization expense in the year ended december   under similar circumstances in the future  our net income and earnings per share may be higher for this reason 
there can be no assurance that this standard will be adopted in its proposed form  or at all 
economic and market conditions prior to the year  the investment management sector has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the financial services industry 
as one example of this growth  the assets under management of mutual funds increased at a compound annual growth rate of from to the end of  to a total of trillion at the end of  according to the investment company institute 
in and in the first quarter of  however  the investment management sector like the financial services industry more broadly experienced extraordinary volatility  as equity markets declined significantly 
domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance  among other factors  affect the financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry 
we cannot guarantee that broader market performance will be favorable in the future 
a continued decline in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in our affiliates performance and may cause our affiliates to experience declining assets under management and or fees  which would reduce cash flow distributable to us 
international operations first quadrant limited  a sister company to first quadrant  lp  is organized and headquartered in london  england 
tweedy  browne company llc  based in new york  also maintains a research office in london 
in the future  we may seek to invest in other investment management firms which are located and or conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on first quadrant limited or other non us investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
