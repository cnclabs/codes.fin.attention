item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations semitool designs  manufactures  installs and services its high performance wet chemical processing equipment for use in the fabrication of semiconductor devices 
our primary suites of tools include electrochemical deposition systems and wet chemical processing systems for wafer cleaning  stripping and etching 
electrochemical deposition applications include plating of copper and gold for ic device interconnects  solder and gold bumps for wafer level packaging and other metals such as nickel and platinum for specialty uses 
typically  there are more than manufacturing steps in fabricating semiconductor devices 
after many of these steps a cleaning  stripping or etching process  including polymer removal  photoresist strip  metal etching  wafer backside cleaning and critical cleaning is required 
our suite of tools for these applications are based on wet spray technologies delivered by automated and semi automated platforms 
we provide worldwide sales  service and support primarily through our employees located in regional offices in the united states  europe  japan  korea  and singapore and through independent sales organizations for certain products in taiwan  japan and china 
in fiscal  our geographic sales distribution was as follows united states   europe   japan  and asia and all others  
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  particularly in asia with the industry trend to semiconductor device outsourcing to foundries in that region  although the percentage of international sales and the geographic distribution may fluctuate from period to period 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of net sales year ende d september  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net gain on sale of subsidiary income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision benefit cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax benefit net income loss the company sold its wholly owned subsidiary  semy engineering  inc  on february  the cumulative effect is a result of the company adopting the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
data to reflect the change in accounting principle in accordance with sab are not available to restate financial information for fiscal years prior to results of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sab retroactive to october  under this method  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of new products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
likewise  sale of existing products to new customer environments are not recognized until acceptance 
whereas  sales of existing products into existing customer environments are treated as multiple element arrangements if multiple elements exist 
the amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount that was due upon title transfer 
the revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and or services are delivered or performed 
revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or ratably over the life of the related service contract 
spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment 
as a result of implementing sab  the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition 
this change resulted in a cumulative deferred revenue of million as of october   which was recorded as a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or a charge of per share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal the deferred profit balance as of october  was million 
deferred profit equals the amount of system revenue that was shipped  but deferred under sab less all applicable product  warranty and commission costs 
of the million in deferred profit  the full amount was recognized in fiscal the results for the first three quarters of fiscal year ended september  have been restated in accordance with sab as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
data to reflect the change in accounting principle in accordance with sab are not available to restate financial information for the periods before october  the change in revenue recognition does not affect the company s cash flow 
prior to june   the company s revenue recognition policy was to recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the customer 
customer service contract revenue was recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
prior to the sale of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  semy engineering  inc  software revenue was recognized when there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the software had been delivered  the price was fixed and determinable  and collectibility was probable in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position software revenue recognition 
net sales 
consolidated net sales were million for fiscal compared to consolidated net sales for fiscal and  which were reported on the historical shipment method of revenue recognition  of million and million  respectively 
fiscal year shipments totaled million 
semiconductor equipment net sales 
fiscal semiconductor equipment net sales were million compared to net sales for fiscal and  which were reported on the historical shipment method of revenue recognition  of million  and million  respectively 
fiscal shipments of semiconductor equipment totaled million 
fiscal shipments increased million as a result of increased shipments of our automated multi wafer batch and single wafer cleaning  stripping and etching equipment  partially offset by a decline in electrochemical deposition equipment shipments 
relative contributions to semiconductor equipment net sales by product line for fiscal were for electrochemical deposition  for cleaning  stripping and etching and for parts  service and other 
the relative contributions to fiscal semiconductor equipment net sales by product line was for electrochemical deposition  for cleaning  stripping and etching and for parts  service and other 
semiconductor equipment net sales for fiscal were million  slightly more than double fiscal s net sales level  as a result of an increase in net sales in all product categories 
demand for electrochemical deposition and automated multi wafer batch cleaning  stripping and etching equipment was particularly strong 
electrochemical deposition equipment net sales were million  an increase of million over fiscal software control systems net sales 
in february  the company sold semy engineering  inc  the sole component of its software controls systems segment  to brooks automation  inc for million in cash and  shares of brooks automation  inc common stock and realized an after tax gain of million 
software control systems net sales for fiscal years  and were million  million  and million  respectively 
orders backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million as of september  orders are generally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no cancellation fees 
as a result of the industry downturn  we experienced both cancellations and the forward rescheduling of equipment delivery dates by customers 
because of these factors and orders placed and shipped in the same quarter  our orders backlog is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
under the sab method of revenue recognition  certain revenues are deferred and recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
deferred revenue at september  was million 
we expect to recognize all of this deferred revenue in fiscal the continued semiconductor market weakness limits our market visibility  however  it is likely that the company will have substantially lower sales in fiscal gross profit 
our gross margin for fiscal was  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in gross margin from fiscal to is attributable to lower absorption of fixed costs during the second half of fiscal  as a result of the industry downturn and sales mix 
our gross margin has been and we believe will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the cost to manufacture  service and support new and enhanced products  the mix and average selling prices of products sold and operating level 
in fiscal s fourth quarter  our sales volume and gross margin were sequentially lower than the previous quarter 
based on our expectation that our fiscal revenue will be substantially lower than the prior year  we expect our gross margin will continue to be subject to downward pressure in fiscal the gross margin increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to our higher capacity utilization  lower warranty cost as a percent of net sales  and product sales mix 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is primary due to increased sales commissions due to higher net sales and geographical mix of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales from fiscal to because we were able to leverage the fixed components of these expenses as sales increased 
the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal compared to fiscal was a result of higher staffing and commission costs related to the higher level of sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percent of sales  research and development expenses were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in r d costs between fiscal and was due mainly to the development of mm tools  further enhancements across the product lines  and included new software and hardware control systems  new robotic automation systems  and the development of our acms product line which provide automated chemical management for our plating systems 
the million increase in absolute dollars in research and development in fiscal from fiscal was a result of research and development for mm product applications  enhancements to electrochemical deposition technologies and a higher development level associated with the increased sales activity 
as a percent of sales  fiscal s spending level was more in line with historical spending levels 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was income of million for fiscal  expense of  for fiscal  and income of million for fiscal major income components were the gain on the sale of the cambridge uk building and land  and interest income of approximately million for fiscal in fiscal  and other income  net included foreign exchange gains of   and million  respectively 
interest expense was approximately  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the foreign exchange gain consisted of net gains and losses resulting from the re measurement of our accounts denominated in non us currencies into us dollars  which is our functional currency  and net gains and losses on forward contracts not designated as hedges 
the net exchange gains were due primarily to fluctuations of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
income taxes 
the fiscal income tax provision was million compared to a million tax provision in fiscal and a million income tax benefit for fiscal the effective income tax rates for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
the anticipated tax rate for fiscal is 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at september  were million up from million at the beginning of the year 
during fiscal  cash provided by operations was million  which contrasts with fiscal when cash used by operations was million 
the year over year change in cash provided by operations is attributable to the declining level of sales and operations due to the semiconductor industry downturn that began in fiscal in fiscal cash provided by operations was primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities reflecting lower sales and operating levels due to the industry downturn 
in fiscal  the semiconductor industry was in a strong growth phase and the company s fiscal net sales grew to more than twice the fiscal level 
as a result of this growth  cash used in operations was primarily the result of increases in accounts receivable and inventory to support the sales growth  but that increase was partially offset by higher net income and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
as of september   we had accounts receivable of million and inventory of million as compared to million and million respectively as of september  we expect future accounts receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
as is customary in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  products are generally built to fill specific customer orders  with typical order fulfillment times ranging from four to six weeks for certain products to six months or more for more complex products 
accordingly  while our finished goods inventory accounts for of total inventory at september   overall inventory levels tend to fluctuate with the level and type of orders received 
currently  the tools with the longest average cycle times are the automated batch and single wafer processing tools 
we expect inventory levels to decline somewhat as sales decline and then increase as new order bookings increase 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million as compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  the sale of semy engineering  inc during fiscal provided million in cash proceeds 
cash used to purchase plant  property and equipment in fiscal was million with million transferred from inventory  compared to million in fiscal cash used for investments in intangible assets  which primarily consisted of intellectual property rights  was approximately million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal cash used in financing activities for fiscal consisted of net repayments on short term borrowings of million and the repayment of approximately  on long term debt and capitalized leases 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided  in cash 
this compares with financing activities for fiscal of cash provided by the exercise of stock options of million and million of additional net borrowings under our line of credit and other short term debt to fund operations and repayments on long term debt and capital leases of  as of september   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  along with funds expected to be generated from operations to meet operating expenses and planned capital expenditures through fiscal in october  we elected not to renew our million revolving credit facility and decided at that time to rely on our cash reserves and expected cash flows to finance our operations and planned capital expenditures 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement which registers the offer and sale of up to an aggregate million of our securities 
if additional financial resources are required in the future  we expect either to issue securities from the shelf registration statement  to issue other financial instruments or to obtain a suitable credit facility  whichever management deems advisable 
however  there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to issue additional common stock or other financial instruments or that we will be able to obtain a credit facility on acceptable terms 
litigation we currently are involved in patent litigation which is described in legal proceedings 
although we are not aware of any infringement by our products of any patents or proprietary rights of others other than as alleged by novellus  inc and described in legal proceedings  further commercialization of our products could provoke claims of infringement from third parties 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation  including the litigation in which we currently are engaged  could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort by us  which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities and damages to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  any of which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement nos 
and sfas and sfas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
sfas replaces apb and eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas  goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
sfas and sfas are effective for all business combinations completed after june  upon adoption of sfas  amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july  will cease  and intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the criteria for recognition under sfas will be reclassified to goodwill 
companies are required to adopt sfas for fiscal years beginning after december   but early adoption is permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas and to have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement provides accounting and reporting standards for recognizing obligations related to asset retirement costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
under this statement  obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets are to be recognized at their fair value in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life 
any subsequent changes to the fair value of the liability due to passage of time or changes in the amount or timing of estimated cash flows is recognized as an accretion expense 
the company will be required to adopt this statement no later than october  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in october of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
impairment of goodwill is not included in the scope of sfas no 
and will be treated in accordance with the accounting standards established in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to sfas no 
 long lived assets are to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing or discontinued operations 
the statement applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of segments of a business 
the company will be required to adopt this statement no later than october  the company is currently assessing the impact of this statement on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rate and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of september   we had approximately million in long term debt and approximately  in short term debt 
our long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate 
as a result  changes in the fixed rate interest market would change the estimated fair value of the fixed rate long term debt 
we believe that a change in the long term interest rate would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
all of our international operations are subject to inherent risks in conducting business abroad  including fluctuation in the relative value of currencies 
we manage this risk and attempt to reduce such exposure through an economic hedge using short term forward exchange contracts 
at september   we held forward contracts to sell japanese yen with a face value of million  a market value of million and an unrealized gain of approximately  however  the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts is offset to the extent of receivables denominated in japanese yen 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on hedged transactions involving japanese yen forward exchange contracts and the underlying transactions would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
