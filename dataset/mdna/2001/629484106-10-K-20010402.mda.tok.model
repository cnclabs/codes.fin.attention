item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company s results of operations are derived from its two main segments which include the domestic insurance companies agencies and mmo london 
the company s domestic insurance companies participate in pools of insurance covering ocean marine  inland marine  aircraft and non marine liability insurance managed by mmo and affiliates 
effective january  and subsequent  the company s participation in the pools increased to 
mmo london wrote a book of ocean marine insurance through its participation in syndicate the following represents the company s net premiums written and net premiums earned for each of the past three years 
nymagic net premiums written by line of business year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine a    inland marine aircraft   other liability    other  total    nymagic net premiums earned by line of business year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine b    inland marine aircraft    other liability    other  total    a includes net premiums written from mmo london of   and  for  and  respectively 
b includes net premiums earned from mmo london of   and  for  and  respectively 
unlike many types of property and casualty insurance  ocean marine  inland marine  aviation and other liability premium rates are not strictly regulated by governmental authorities 
consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and the anticipation of positive underwriting results 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include both brokerage commissions and premium taxes which are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
such costs have generally changed in proportion to changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 
as compared to the company reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or 
per diluted share as compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the company reported an operating loss  which excludes the effects of realized investment gains after taxes  for the year ended december   of million or 
per diluted share compared with operating income of million  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decline in operating income in principally reflects the underwriting losses attributable to mmo london including costs associated with the run off of syndicate which ceased underwriting in the third quarter of results from operations were reduced by such losses for the year ended december  by per diluted share 
this compares with losses of 
per diluted share from mmo london in the prior year 
the exchange of the company s lloyd s agency for a minority interest in cathedral capital plc  in the fourth quarter of  resulted in an after tax gain of approximately  or 
per diluted share 
net premiums earned increased by for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
the increase in the current year s premiums is largely attributable to premiums emanating from the participation in syndicate through mmo london 
net premiums earned from mmo london grew to million in as compared to million in and much of the increase is attributable to a transaction involving a one time assumption of approximately million of ocean marine and casualty premiums 
the company placed syndicate into run off in the third quarter of in  mmo london will maintain a position in syndicate and will derive its share of gross premium writings up to a maximum of million 
such writings will be concentrated mainly in assumed reinsurance of aviation and property business 
net premiums earned from domestic insurance companies increased by in due mainly to growth in the aviation line of business 
aviation net premiums earned grew for the year as a result of the effect of higher retention levels in due to the non renewal of a quota share treaty which the company maintained since as well as rate increases on policies 
the increase in aviation writings was offset by a reduction in policy count and average line size 
in  the company expects gross premium rates to continue to firm  however  additional reinsurance costs as a result of the hardening of the aviation reinsurance market will mitigate such increases 
ocean marine premiums earned derived from the domestic insurance companies decreased in when compared to however  net writings increased in when compared to the prior year due  in large part  to a firming of marine rates in which created opportunities to produce additional writings particularly in the hull and cargo marine classes 
the company expects gross and net writings to increase in as rates continue to firm across the various classes within the ocean marine line 
other liability premiums earned increased in the growth in premiums is attributable to writing a new class of assumed auto liability business in the company expects other liability premiums to increase in as opportunities exist for additional production in the excess and surplus lines markets as pricing continues to firm 
inland marine premiums increased mainly due to additional production in the company expects inland marine writings to further increase in due to additional production opportunities in the excess and surplus lines markets 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned the loss ratio was for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
the increase resulted from a significant frequency of larger than anticipated losses derived from the underwriting operations of mmo london which resulted in a loss ratio of for year ended december  the loss ratio from the domestic insurance companies increased in to from in the prior year primarily due to increases in both the frequency and severity of losses in the aviation line of business 
the company s domestic insurance companies recorded favorable net loss experience in the ocean marine line compared to the prior year period 
policy acquisition expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  was as compared with for the same period in the increase in the ratio in is primarily attributable to higher acquisition costs on uk derived business and larger acquisition expenses in the current year s aviation line which do not reflect the benefit of ceded override commissions for business incepting in net investment income for the year ended december  decreased by from the level of net investment income achieved in the decline was principally caused by a reduction in invested assets offset by higher yields on investments due to a higher interest rate environment in and increased investments in taxable securities 
general and administrative expenses were flat in when compared to the prior year 
the prior year s amounts included larger expenses incurred in connection with employee benefit plans  however  the current year expenses reflect a million litigation settlement 
realized investment gains were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and each resulted mainly from the sale of appreciated equity securities 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in loan principal outstanding 
commission income was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year 
reflected larger reinsurance contingent commissions derived from the profitability of certain reinsurance agreements in the aviation and ocean marine lines 
other income increased substantially for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the increase was attributable to the exchange of the company s lloyd s agency for a minority interest in cathedral capital plc which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately  as compared to net income for the year ended december   was  or per diluted share compared with the year ended december   net income of  or per diluted share 
operating income  which excludes the effects of realized investment gains after taxes  was  or 
per share  for the year ended december   versus  or per share  for the prior year 
for the year ended december   net premiums earned were  as compared with  for the amount included approximately million relating to two transactions involving assumptions of ocean marine and casualty business 
excluding these one time items  net premiums earned for the year ended december  would have increased 
ocean marine net premiums earned increased in by  excluding one time items  and is largely attributable to business derived from mmo london 
approximately million in net premiums earned  mostly ocean marine hull  was produced by syndicate through mmo london in  its first full year of operations  when compared to  excluding one time items  in net premiums earned from the domestic insurance companies agencies segment were down as competition generally remained intense in and adversely affected ocean marine premium rates as well as premium renewals 
aviation gross premium written grew in to million as a result of rate increases obtained in on accounts with poor loss records as well as increases in overall line size per account 
as the underwriting climate for gross premiums remained soft in in the aviation line  the company maintained an adequate level of reinsurance to protect its exposure to any one loss 
as a result  after excess of loss and quota share reinsurance  the company s net writings amounted to million in the other liability line decreased in  excluding one time items  when compared to due to the effects of competitive pricing as well as a decline in premium production losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned were for the year ended december   as compared to  excluding one time items  for the prior year 
the domestic insurance subsidiaries recorded higher loss ratios in the aviation line of business in due to increases in both the frequency and severity of losses 
in addition  the company s ocean marine line recorded higher loss ratios in  primarily attributable to the loss experience produced from mmo london which experienced a relatively high frequency of marine hull claims in commission income increased substantially in when compared to and reflected larger profit commissions on the reinsurance of the company s ocean marine and aviation lines of business 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in loan principal outstanding 
net investment income for the year ended december  decreased by from the level of net investment income achieved in contributing to the decline were lower overall investment yields and a reduction in invested assets brought about by the payments of a large number of losses on a gross basis in the aviation and other liability lines of business 
policy acquisition expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared with for the prior year 
the increase in the ratio is due in large part to the two transactions involving assumptions of premiums in absent such business  the ratio would have been approximately for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses decreased by in from the prior year s amounts included certain non recurring expenses incurred in connection with the assumption of premiums and the formation of mmo london 
in addition  larger expenses were recorded for two employee benefit plans in within the domestic insurance agencies 
realized investment gains of  for the year ended december  resulted in large part from the sale of appreciated equity securities 
in addition  sales resulted from monitoring the company s overall exposure to equity securities to be in accordance with its investment guidelines 
total investments decreased to million at december  primarily due to reductions in unrealized gains on investments as a result of rising interest rates and reductions in the investment portfolio to fund payments of aviation and other liability losses on a gross basis 
these payments contributed to cash flow used in operations in of million 
reinsurance is maintained at an adequate level to prevent any one loss from significantly affecting net income 
however  timing differences between the payment of gross losses by the company and cash collections received from reinsurers may adversely impact cash flow in any one period 
reinsurance receivables increased by to million as of december  increases in gross severity losses in the aviation  umbrella and ocean marine lines  of which substantial amounts were ceded under various reinsurance agreements  accounted for the increase 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased to million from million in and principally reflects the adverse impact of higher interest rates in on the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company monitors cash and short term investments in order to have an adequate level of funds available to satisfy claims and expenses as they become due 
as of december   the company s assets included approximately million in cash and short term investments 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income and maturing or liquidating investments 
cash flows were used in operating activities in each of the past three years as declines in premium rates  increases in ceded reinsurance premium costs and increases in gross severity claims negatively affected cash flows from operations 
the company s maturing book of other liability business also adversely affected cash flows 
the cash flows used in operating activities in the past three years was provided by investing activities and  in particular  through the sale or maturity of fixed income securities 
financing activities occurred as a result of borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement and unsecured credit facility 
the company borrowed approximately  in to assist in the payment of gross losses of the company and to repurchase the company s common stock 
borrowings under the unsecured credit facility were fully repaid after collecting recoverables due from reinsurers on such losses and repayments under the company s existing loan were made at  per quarter over the past three years through december  in  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement the agreement with a bank for purposes of hedging its interest rate risk on its existing bank loan 
the agreement requires the company to pay interest to the bank at a rate of on the original notional amount outstanding of  which is subsequently adjusted quarterly by notional reductions of  the bank is required to pay the company  on the same notional amounts outstanding  an amount equal to the three month us dollar london interbank offered rate plus 
which is reset on a quarterly basis 
the interest expense benefit recorded under the agreement was  in   in and  in the company adheres to investment guidelines set by the finance committee of the board of directors 
the investment guidelines are conservatively designed to provide the company with adequate capital growth and sufficient liquidity to meet existing obligations 
such guidelines consider many factors including anticipated tax position and regulatory requirements

the company adopted sfas on january  and such adoption did not have a material effect on its financial statements 
inflation periods of inflation have prompted the pools  and consequently the company  to react quickly to actual or potential imbalances between costs  including claim expenses  and premium rates 
these imbalances have been corrected mainly through improved underwriting controls  responsive management information systems and frequent review of premium rates and loss experience 
inflation also affects the final settlement costs of claims  which may not be paid for several years 
the longer a claim takes to settle  the more significant the impact of inflation on final settlement costs 
the company periodically reviews outstanding claims and adjusts reserves for the pools based on a number of factors  including inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to reasonably possible changes in the fair value of financial instruments which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
the largest market risk to the company relates to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
this risk is considered when developing benchmarks for evaluating the company s portfolio 
such benchmarks also consider the overall duration of the company s loss reserves 
through the matching of cash flows from future maturing investments and the ultimate payout pattern of loss reserves  the company believes it can minimize the effect of interest rate risk 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
taxables also include mortgage backed securities that have prepayment features which may cause actual cash flows to differ from those based on maturity date 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts dollars in millions total total there amortized fair fixed maturities after cost value tax exempts average interest rate taxables average interest rate total credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
the company s investment guidelines are conservatively designed and prevent the investment in securities below an a rating 
overall  the company maintains fixed maturities with an average credit quality rating of aa as of december  the company s exposure to credit risk is considered minimal 
foreign currency risk includes exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on the market value and interest income of foreign denominated investments 
mmo london operations maintains cash and investments in british pounds sterling with a us equivalent of  to the extent business is derived from transactions in such currency 
the investment of cash flows from business written in pounds sterling in securities of the same foreign currency should ultimately mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to british pounds sterling 
equity risk includes the potential loss from changes in the fair value of equity securities 
the company s equity securities are traded on major stock exchanges and are highly liquid 
the investment in such securities are limited by the company s investment guidelines to of statutory surplus in order to minimize the impact of large changes in the stock market on its surplus 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with investment advisors  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines  the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the portfolio
