our products and services are sold to school districts by a direct field sales force and supported by our professional development team who assist in implementing our curricula in schools 
we commenced operations in september  and through june our activities consisted primarily of designing and developing lightspan achieve now 
in january  we released our lightspan achieve now curriculum for use on windows based personal computers 
in the fall of that year  we released the product for use on the playstation game console 
to supplement our product offerings  we introduced the lightspan network in january we acquired academic and global schoolhouse in september  and studyweb in october we also introduced lightspan 
com in september  and enhanced it with the lightspan learning store in october and with your school online and your class online in february in may  we acquired learningplanet

in august  we introduced lightspan achieve now version results of operations operating losses 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and  as of january   have accumulated losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
in july  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to a refocus of our sales and marketing efforts from our free internet products towards our fee based subscription internet products 
in addition  in july  we completed and shipped the remaining lightspan achieve now titles used on a pc platform and the playstation game console  recognizing million during the first two quarters of fiscal year ended july  in revenue previously deferred pursuant to sop  resulting in an operating loss of million for the year ended january  fiscal 
the operating results in fiscal are not indicative of our underlying business in that year  and are not indicative of results that may be expected for the foreseeable future 
recognition of revenue effective february   we adopted sop  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which caused a substantial change in the timing of when revenue was recognized for lightspan achieve now licenses 
under sop  we were unable to recognize any lightspan achieve now license fees as revenue until we shipped the final title which we planned to provide to all existing customers for no additional charge 
therefore  we deferred the recognition of revenue for all lightspan achieve now licenses shipped in the years ended january  and by april   we had completed and shipped all lightspan achieve now titles in all grade clusters used on the playstation game console and grade cluster k through used on a pc platform  resulting in the recognition in the first quarter of fiscal of million of revenue previously deferred 
by july   we had completed and shipped all remaining lightspan achieve now titles used on a pc platform  resulting in the recognition in the second quarter of fiscal of the remaining million of revenue previously deferred 
subsequent to july   we did not defer revenue relating to lightspan achieve now licenses that were shipped as we had completed the development of all lightspan achieve now titles 
to the extent that we deferred the lightspan achieve now license revenue until delivery of final titles  pursuant to sop  we also deferred the costs of duplicating the product and packaging it for distribution 
in the three months ended april   we recognized million in cost of license revenue when we recognized the related million in revenue 
in the three months ended july   we recognized million in cost of license revenue when we recognized the related million in revenue

expenses sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this was primarily due to an increase in personnel and related commissions  promotional activities connected to the launch of lightspan

through january   we have paid million in involuntary termination benefits and exit costs relating to the restructuring charge 
we anticipate paying the remaining involuntary termination benefits and exit costs through the first quarter of fiscal as we have experienced significant customer interest and acceptance of our fee based subscription internet products  with many schools searching for web content to deliver on newly installed infrastructures  we decided to emphasize the fee based subscription portion of our prek business and reduce the high promotional spending necessary to generate consumer traffic for our free site  lightspan

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement the statement defers the effective date of sfas no 
and will become effective for us for the year ending january  we have reviewed the impact of this standard on our current reporting and disclosures and do not believe the adoption of fas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab  revenue recognition in financial statements

the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the interest rates which are tied to market rates  and our investments in interest sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and do not expect to in the future 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in securities rated aa or better 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at january  or declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
