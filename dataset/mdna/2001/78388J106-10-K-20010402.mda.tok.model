item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the united states 
we generate revenues from our two primary businesses  site leasing and site development 
in our site leasing business  we lease antenna space on towers and other structures that we own or manage for others 
the towers that we own have either been built by us at the request of a carrier or built or acquired based on our own initiative 
in our site development business  we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks  including designing a network with full signal coverage  identifying and acquiring locations to place their antennas  obtaining zoning approvals  building towers when necessary and installing their antennas 
since our founding in  we have participated in the development of more than  antenna sites in of the major wireless markets in the united states 
site leasing services in  we began aggressively expanding our site leasing business by capitalizing on our nationally recognized site development experience and strong relationships with wireless service providers to take advantage of the trends toward independent tower ownership and co location  which is the placement of multiple antennas on one tower 
as of december   we owned or controlled  towers with  tenants  or tenants per tower 
in addition  we had agreements to acquire towers 
we also had carrier directives to build over additional towers and had  in various phases of development  over  locations which we had internally identified as desirable locations on which to build a tower 
we believe our history and experience in providing site development services gives us a competitive advantage in choosing the most attractive locations on which to build new towers or buy existing towers  as measured by our success in increasing tower revenues and cash flows 
our same tower revenue growth at december  on the  towers we owned as of december  was  based on tenant leases signed and revenues annualized as of december  we signed new tenant leases in the quarter ended december  on the  towers we owned at the beginning of the quarter  at an average initial monthly rent of  our annualized rate of tenants added per tower  on a broadband equivalent basis  was    
for each of the last four quarters 
a broadband equivalent basis is calculated by dividing total lease revenue by  an industry benchmark for monthly tower rent per tenant 
we believe that our annualized rate of new tenants added per tower per quarter is among the highest in the industry 
we have focused our capital expenditures on building new towers and acquiring existing towers 
in general  we have chosen to build rather than buy the substantial majority   of our towers because we believe the economics of building are more favorable 
to date  our average construction cost of a new tower is approximately  while we believe the industry s average acquisition cost of a new tower over the last two years has been approximately while we have focused primarily on building new towers for growth  we have also acquired towers as of december  we seek to acquire towers where we can increase cash flow to substantially reduce the tower cash flow multiple paid at acquisition through additional tenant leases 
the tower acquisitions to date were completed at an aggregate purchase price of million  which averages to a price of approximately  per tower 
in addition to what we have already acquired  we are actively negotiating to acquire existing towers 
in september  we entered into an agreement to acquire existing towers from telecorp pcs  inc telecorp 
the acquisition price of each tower will be  the tower acquisition agreement is subject to our satisfactory completion of our review of the business  financial and legal aspects of towers that may be acquired  and other items 
on march  the company paid million to purchase towers under the telecorp agreement 
we anticipate that we will close on the remaining towers in the second quarter of in december  we entered into an agreement with us unwired to purchase a total of towers 
we purchased towers in december  and expect to purchase the remaining towers in the second quarter of  for approximately million 
as of december   we had agreements to acquire towers in separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including the telecorp and us unwired agreements 
these acquisitions are subject to a number of conditions and may or may not occur 
site development services our site development business consists of two segments  site development consulting and site development construction  through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of end to end services 
in the consulting segment of our site development business  we offer clients the following services network pre design  identification of potential locations for towers and antennas  support in buying or leasing of the location  and assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 
in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services  including the following tower and related site construction  switch construction  and antenna installation 
we believe that our total site development business will grow with the expected overall growth of wireless and other telecommunications networks 
we anticipate that site development construction revenues will continue to exceed site development consulting revenues 
we also believe that our site leasing revenues will grow as wireless service providers continue to lease antenna space on our towers and the number of towers we own or control grows 
results of operations as we continue our transition into site leasing  operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future prospects 
you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 
we expect that the acquisitions consummated to date and any future acquisitions  as well as our new tower builds  will have a material impact on future revenues  expenses and net loss 
revenues  cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest income and interest expense each increased significantly in the year ended december  as compared to  and some or all of those items may continue to increase significantly in future periods 
we believe that our new tower build programs may have a material effect on future financial results  which effect will probably be negative until such time  if ever  as the newly constructed towers attain higher levels of tenant use 
year ended compared to year ended total revenues increased to million for from million for total site development revenue increased to million in from million in due to an increase in both site development construction revenue and site development consulting revenue

gross profit margin on site development construction decreased to for from in due to an increase in the use of subcontractor labor 
gross profit for the site leasing business increased in from in the increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the period 
the increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and the resulting increase in average revenue per tower  which was greater than the increase in average expenses

site development construction revenue increased to million for from million for  due to the acquisition of network services on april  as well as higher levels of activity 
site development consulting revenue decreased to million for from million for  due primarily to the decreased demand for site acquisition and zoning services from pcs licensees  as well as the increasing acceptance by wireless carriers of outsourced communication site infrastructure through build to suit programs where site acquisition and zoning services are provided by the tower owner 
site leasing revenue increased to million for from million for  due to a substantial number of revenue producing towers added during the period through new builds and acquisitions as well as the addition of new tenants on existing towers

gross profit for site development construction services increased to million for from million for due to higher revenue 
gross profit for site development consulting services decreased to million for from million for the lower gross profit margins experienced in on site development consulting services were due to more work being performed on a fixed fee basis and the completion of a number of large projects on which we experienced proportionately higher expenses than in the earlier stages of a project 
gross profit for the site leasing business increased to million for from million for due primarily to higher revenue but also due to higher gross profit margins earned on towers owned as opposed to the margins earned on our lease sublease business which contributed most of our site leasing revenue 
as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit increased to for as compared to for due to a greater percentage of gross profit coming from higher margin site leasing revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for primarily due to the addition of personnel  the expansion of office space and overall increases in operating expenses attributable to the growth in the organization and building of our tower development infrastructure

our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries 
we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  other than financings  is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries 
even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend  distribute funds  pay interest or principal on the senior notes entered into in  or the senior discount notes or that we will be permitted to pay any dividends under the terms of any new debt facility 
net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million as compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues 
net cash used in investing activities for year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of tower acquisitions and new build activity in versus net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in was attributable to our equity offerings of class a common stock which closed in february and august  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of million as of december  and negative working capital of million as of december  this is primarily due to the timing of certain accrued expenses related to our business operations and our use of a revolving credit facility to satisfy short term liquidity needs as opposed to carrying large cash balances 
in february  we completed an offering of million shares of our class a common stock 
we raised gross proceeds of million  which produced net proceeds of approximately million  after deduction of the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
we used million of these net proceeds to repay all revolving credit loans under the senior credit facility 
remaining proceeds were used for the construction and acquisition of towers and for general working capital purposes 
additionally  in february the managing underwriters of the offering exercised and closed on their over allotment option to purchase an additional million shares of our class a common stock from certain shareholders 
we did not receive any proceeds as a result of this exercise 
in july  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s registering the sale of up to million of any combination of the following securities class a common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares  or warrants 
in august  we completed an offering under this universal shelf of million shares of our class a common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of the over allotment option 
we raised gross proceeds of million  which produced net proceeds of approximately million  after deduction of the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
we used million of these net proceeds to repay a portion of the term loans under the senior credit facility 
remaining proceeds were used for the construction and acquisition of towers and general working capital purposes 
as of the date of this report  we may issue any combination of the registered securities with an aggregate offering price of up to million under this universal shelf registration statement 
in february  the company closed on million senior notes due  which produced net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering expenses 
the company used million of these proceeds to repay all borrowings under the senior credit facility and terminated the senior credit agreement 
on march   the company used million of the remaining proceeds to purchase towers under the telecorp agreement 
we intend to use approximately million of the remaining proceeds to purchase the remaining towers under the telecorp agreement and approximately million to purchase towers from us unwired 
remaining proceeds will be used to finance the construction and acquisition of additional towers and related businesses and for general working capital purposes 
interest on these notes is payable on february and august of each year  beginning august  the senior notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with the company s other existing and future senior indebtedness 
the senior notes place certain restrictions on  among other things  the incurrance of debt and liens  issuance of preferred stock  payment of dividends or other distributions  sale of assets  transactions with affiliates  sale and leaseback transactions  certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities 
our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  and for the year ended december   were million 
we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during the year ending december  of at least million to million  including up to million for the acquisition of up to towers we may acquire from telecorp and us unwired 
substantially all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by the proceeds of our million senior note offering completed in february  cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including acquisition opportunities that become available during the period  the needs of our build to suit customers and the availability to us of additional debt or equity capital on acceptable terms 
in the event that we do not have sufficient liquidity when an acquisition or construction opportunity arises  we would be required to seek additional debt or equity financing 
failure to obtain any such financing could require us to significantly reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our tower construction activities or acquisitions  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our projected financial condition or results of operations 
in addition we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness including our senior notes and our senior discount notes on  or prior to  scheduled maturity 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay interest on  our debt obligations  and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations including the senior notes or the senior discount notes  or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we have on file with the securities and exchange commission shelf registration statements on form s registering up to a total of  shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the united states 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of class a common stock under these registration statements in connection with ten acquisitions 
as of december   we had  shares of class a common stock remaining on these shelf registration statements 
in addition to the issuance under the shelf registration statements  on september   we issued  restricted shares of class a common stock to the former shareholders of network services  in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement 
at december   our senior credit facility  as amended  consisted of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
availability under the senior credit facility was determined by a number of factors  including the number of towers built by us with anchor tenants on the date of completion  the financial performance of our towers  the financial performance of our site development segment  as well as by other financial covenants  financial ratios and other conditions 
at december   we had the million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility at a variable rate and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a variable rate 
in the first quarter of  we used proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility  and terminated the facility 
accordingly  the company wrote off deferred financing fees related to the senior credit facility and will record a million extraordinary loss in the first quarter of in connection with the termination of this facility 
at december   we had million outstanding on our senior discount notes  net of unamortized original issue discount of million 
the senior discount notes mature on march  inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks which are inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business  and in some cases relate to our acquisition of related businesses 
during the year ended december  we were subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility 
at december  our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of the accreted balance of the senior discount notes 
in the future  we may be subject to increased rate risk on any senior credit facility we may enter into and any other further financings

we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding long term and short term debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 
in february the company closed million of its senior notes due  and used a portion of the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility and terminated the facility 
senior discount note disclosure requirements the indenture governing our senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from unrestricted subsidiaries and the disclosure to be made of tower cash flow  as defined in the indenture  for the most recent fiscal quarter and adjusted consolidated cash flow  as defined in the indenture  for the most recently completed four quarter period 
as of december  we had no unrestricted subsidiaries 
tower cash flow  as defined in the indenture  for the quarter ended december  was million 
adjusted consolidated cash flow for the year ended december  was million
