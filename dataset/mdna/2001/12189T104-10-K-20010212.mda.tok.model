item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this filing 
government regulation and legislation rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the stb of the united states department of transportation dot  the federal railroad administration of dot  the occupational safety and health administration osha  and state regulatory agencies 
the stb  which is the successor to the interstate commerce commission icc  has jurisdiction over certain rates  routes  and services  the extension  sale  or abandonment of rail lines  and consolidation or merger with  or acquisition of control of  rail common carriers 
on october   the stb issued a notice of proposed rulemaking relating to standards to be used in evaluating applications for authority to engage in certain railroad mergers  consolidations  and changes in control that are deemed major transactions under stb regulations 
the proposed new standards are designed to increase the burden on applicants to demonstrate that a proposed merger is in the public interest 
the rulemaking is expected to be completed in june dot and osha have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations 
state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 
bnsf railway s rail operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
these laws cover discharges to waters  air emissions  toxic substances  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
this regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations 
environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
many of bnsf railway s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf railway is now subject and will from time to time continue to be subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on current and former owners and operators of a site 
accordingly  bnsf railway may be responsible under cercla and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by bnsf railway  its current lessees  former owners or lessees of properties  or other third parties 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing 
competition the business environment in which bnsf railway operates remains highly competitive 
depending on the specific market  deregulated motor carriers  other railroads and river barges may exert pressure on price and service levels 
the presence of advanced  high service truck lines with expedited delivery  subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non bulk  time sensitive freight 
the potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads 
in order to remain competitive  bnsf railway and other railroads strive to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity 
as railroads streamline  rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises  competition among rail carriers intensifies 
bnsf railway s primary rail competitor in the western region of the united states is union pacific railroad company up 
other class i railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by bnsf railway 
coal  one of bnsf railway s primary commodities  continues to be subject to various types of competitive pressures 
as a condition to approval of the merger of rail carriers controlled by union pacific and southern pacific  the stb in its decision required the grant to bnsf railway of trackage rights over approximately  miles of up sp track 
bnsf railway also purchased over miles of track from up sp as a result of the stb s decision 
bnsf railway and union pacific compete head to head in gulf coast  intermountain and west coast markets served by these lines 
in  bnsf railway and up entered into an agreement to exchange half interests in the two pieces of the former southern pacific transportation company sp rail line between houston and new orleans which are separately owned by the two railroads 
both railroads now have access to all customers  including chemical  steel  gas and other companies  along the entire line  including on former sp branch lines 
the stb approved the carve up of consolidated rail corporation conrail between csx corporation and norfolk southern corporation which was implemented in csx and norfolk southern operate the two largest rail systems in the eastern united states 
also  in  canadian national railway company cn acquired illinois central corporation ic 
cn is canada s largest railroad and reaches the us cities of detroit and chicago  while ic has operations extending from chicago to the gulf of mexico  and west through iowa 
in january  cn announced its intention to acquire the wisconsin central  a regional railroad with track and trackage rights in illinois  wisconsin  minnesota  michigan  and the province of ontario 
item legal proceedings bnsf and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of legal actions and claims  various governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including those related to environmental matters and personal injury claims 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available  it is the opinion of bnsf management that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of bnsf  although an adverse resolution of a number of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing for information concerning certain pending administrative appeals with the internal revenue service

the principal subsidiary of bnsf is the burlington northern and santa fe railway company bnsf railway 
all earnings per share information is stated on a diluted basis 
revenue table the following table presents bnsf s revenue information by commodity for the years ended december   and and includes certain reclassifications of prior year information to conform to current year presentation 
average revenue revenues cars units per car unit in millions in thousands intermodal       carload          coal          agricultural commodities       automotive    total freight revenues 
         other revenues total revenues    results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income in was million per share compared with  million per share for the decrease in earnings per share is primarily due to the effect on net income of a million increase in fuel expenses and recognition in of a gain of million pre tax in connection with prior period line sales  less costs of million pre tax related to those sales  partially offset by the favorable effect of the common stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources common stock repurchase program 
revenues total revenues for were  million or million higher than revenues of  million 
the million increase primarily reflects increases in the intermodal  carload and automotive sectors  partially offset by lower coal and agricultural revenues 
average revenue per car unit decreased in to  from  in volumes increased for the year but experienced a general slowing late in based on economic conditions which have continued in january during  based on reporting to the association of american railroads aar  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic market decreased points to percent 
intermodal revenues of  million improved million  or percent  compared with reflecting increases in the international and truckload sectors  partially offset by decreases in the intermodal marketing companies imc and direct marketing sectors 
international revenues were up due to high levels of trans pacific trade as well as market share gains with mitsui  yang ming and hapag lloyd 
truckload revenues benefited from strong schneider national loadings 
these revenue increases were partially offset by decreases in the direct marketing sector due to decreased loadings within the less than truckload segment and in the imc sector due to pricing pressures  and strong over the road competition 
carload revenues  which include revenues from the chemicals  forest products  metals  minerals and machinery  perishable and dry boxcar sectors  of  million for were million  or percent  higher than due to increases from the metals  perishables  and minerals sectors  partially offset by decreased chemicals  forest products  and machinery revenues 
the metals increases were a result of a strong market for steel  the growth in perishables was from the success of new service offerings and a partial recapture of the truck market  and increases in minerals were due to higher demand for clay and sand used in domestic oil production 
these increases were partially offset by decreased shipments of industrial chemicals  softness in the forest products sector  and lower shipments of heavy machinery 
coal revenues of  million for decreased million  or percent  as a result of volume decreases due to a decrease in demand as a result of milder weather and high customer inventories that affected shipments for most of the year  while benefited from an inventory build up in preparation for possible year outages 
agricultural commodities revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than due primarily to weaker corn export shipments to the pacific northwest and mexico  and decreased shipments of gulf and pacific northwest wheat  both caused by worldwide crop competition 
revenues were also lower as a result of decreased shipments of bulk foods due to an oversupply of sugar and supplier price competition in the syrup market which resulted in less traffic 
automotive revenues of million for were million  or percent  higher than reflecting increased industry wide automobile production for most of the year and more profitable longer haul traffic despite essentially flat volumes year over year 
expenses total operating expenses for were  million  an increase of million or percent  compared with operating expenses for of  million  despite a million increase in fuel expenses 
compensation and benefits expenses of  million were million  or percent  lower than primarily due to lower employment levels and reduced incentive expense partially offset by increased base wages 
purchased services of  million for were million  or percent  lower than primarily as a result of decreased joint facility and contract switching charges as well as recoveries related to prior periods 
this decrease was partially offset by increased contract equipment maintenance costs due to an increase in the number of locomotives under maintenance contracts and volume related increases in ramping expenses 
equipment rents expenses of million were million  or percent  lower than as a result of lower lease rates on rail cars as well as a decrease in the number of leased agricultural commodity and coal cars  partially offset by increased locomotive rental expense 
fuel expenses of million for were million  or percent  higher than  as a result of a cent  or percent  increase in the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel  partially offset by a percent decrease in consumption from  million gallons to  million gallons 
the increase in the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel includes a cent increase in the average purchase price  partially offset by the favorable impact in from the company s fuel hedging program of cents per gallon compared with additional expense from hedging of cent per gallon in materials and other expenses of million for were million  or percent  lower than principally reflecting i reorganization costs of million incurred in the second quarter of for severance  pension  medical and other benefit costs for approximately involuntarily terminated salaried employees see other matters employee merger and separation costs  ii lower current year environmental expenses and other materials costs compared with  and iii higher current year gains from easement sales 
offsetting these decreases were i million of employee related severance  medical and other benefit costs recorded in the second quarter of see other matters employee merger and separation costs for approximately involuntarily terminated employees  primarily material handlers in mechanical shops and trainmen reserve boards  ii million credit for the reversal of certain liabilities associated with the consolidation of clerical functions in the second quarter see other matters employee merger and separation costs  iii the loss of previously earned state tax incentives in the second quarter  and iv higher costs in related to the maintenance of leased equipment 
interest expense for of million increased million  or percent  principally reflecting higher debt levels resulting from the company s share repurchase program and higher interest rates 
total debt increased to  million at december   from  million at december  other income expense  net was unfavorable by million compared with primarily due to a million pre tax deferred gain recognized during in connection with the sale of rail lines in southern california in and  and the recognition in of million pre tax of expenses related to the termination of the proposed combination with canadian national railway company see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  earnings per share increased to per share for from per share for  although net income was slightly lower for at  million compared with net income of  million 
the slight decrease in net income is primarily due to a gain of million on the sale of substantially all of the company s interest in santa fe pacific pipeline partners  lp  along with gains on real estate portfolio sales and higher interest expense in incurred on borrowings to fund the share repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources common stock repurchase program  and increased environmental expenses 
these decreases in net income were partially offset by increased operating revenues in due to volume gains in most sectors 
revenues total revenues for were  million  or percent  higher compared with revenues of  million for the million increase primarily reflects increases in the intermodal  agricultural commodities and automotive sectors  partially offset by lower carload and coal revenues 
average revenue per car unit decreased slightly in to  from  in during  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic market  based on reporting to the aar  decreased points to percent 
this decrease in market share was primarily due to union pacific regaining market share as a result of its recovery from operating difficulties experienced in the prior year 
carload revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than due to decreases in the chemicals  minerals and machinery  and metals sectors  partially offset by increased forest product revenues 
the decreases were a result of weaknesses in the chemicals sector due to soft fertilizer markets  weaknesses in the metals sector due to increased steel imports  and a decrease in dedicated train movements of heavy machinery 
these decreases were partially offset by increased inland shipments of forest products 
intermodal revenues of  million improved million  or percent  compared with reflecting increases in the direct marketing  international and truckload sectors  partially offset by decreases in the intermodal marketing companies imc sector 
direct marketing revenues benefited from year over year growth of units shipped for ups and roadway express 
international revenues were up due to market share gains and new business with sealand  nyk  maersk and k line 
truckload revenues were driven primarily by year over year growth in jb hunt  swift and triple crown loadings 
these revenue increases were partially offset by decreases in the imc sector due to competitive pricing pressures  an overall softening in the imc market  and increased trucking capacity 
coal revenues of  million for decreased million  or percent  as a result of a decrease in average revenue per car due to a decline in coal shipping rates on contracts renewed beginning in late at the lower and market based rates 
operating difficulties early in the year at the powder river basin mines  and a decrease in the demand for coal due to milder weather for most of the year  contributed to the year over year decrease  which was partially offset by an inventory build up in to prepare for possible year outages 
the total number of rail cars shipped increased by  or percent  over volumes 
agricultural commodities revenues of  million for were million  or percent  higher than due primarily to increased demand for soybean exports and pacific northwest corn 
the increase in soybean revenue was fueled by favorable pricing and an increased supply of soybeans that was sufficient to meet the higher demand 
increases in revenue were slightly offset by lower wheat revenue per car and fewer soybean oil shipments in compared with automotive revenues of million for were million  or percent  higher than reflecting growth in vehicle shipments due to both a record year of new vehicle production coupled with an increase in revenue per unit as a result of a favorable change in the mix of vehicles transported 
expenses total operating expenses for were  million  an increase of million or percent  compared with operating expenses for of  million 
compensation and benefits expenses of  million were million  or percent  lower than primarily due to lower employment levels resulting from the second quarter reorganization discussed in other matters employee merger and separation costs partially offset by increased base wage rates 
purchased services of  million for were million  or percent  higher than due primarily to increased contract equipment maintenance costs as well as ramping and other transportation service contracts  partially offset by lower haulage expenses 
equipment rents expenses of million were million  or percent  lower than as a result of lower intermodal equipment costs due to a reduction in time and mileage  and trailer and container expenses 
lower agricultural leased car expense due to improved cycle times also contributed to the decrease 
fuel expenses of million for were million  or percent  lower than  as a result of a cent  or percent  decrease in the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel  partially offset by a percent volume driven increase in consumption from  million gallons to  million gallons 
the average all in cost per gallon of diesel fuel decreased year over year due to current year fuel hedge losses of cent per gallon compared to cents per gallon in the prior year  which were partially offset by a cent increase in the average purchase price 
materials and other expenses of million for were million  or percent  higher than principally reflecting higher environmental  personal injury  property and other tax expenses 
as discussed in other matters employee merger and separation costs  reorganization costs of million were incurred during the second quarter of for severance  pension  medical and other benefit costs for approximately involuntarily terminated salaried employees that were part of a reorganization program announced in may to reduce operating expenses and an additional million of costs incurred for relocating approximately non union employees as a result of the reorganization 
in addition  the company also reversed during the second quarter certain merger severance liabilities of million associated with the company s clerical consolidation plan 
these liabilities related to planned work force reductions which were no longer needed due to the company s ability to utilize a series of job swaps between certain locations to achieve the advantages of functional work consolidation 
interest expense for of million increased million  or percent  principally reflecting higher debt levels resulting from the company s share repurchase program 
total debt increased to  million at december   from  million at december  other income expense  net was unfavorable by million compared with primarily due to the million gain pre tax on the sale of substantially all of the company s interest in santa fe pacific pipeline partners  lp in and gains of million pre tax from the sale of a real estate portfolio in this was partially offset by the recognition in of a million pre tax deferred gain in connection with the sale of rail lines in southern california in and liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations is bnsf s principal source of liquidity 
bnsf generally funds any additional liquidity requirements through debt issuance  including commercial paper or leasing of assets 
during  bnsf generated free cash flow after dividends paid calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures  other investing activities and dividends paid of million  an improvement of million from free cash flow of million in this increase was due primarily to reduced capital spending partially offset by reduced cash flow from operating activities 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million during compared with  million during the decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to a decrease in net income and lower deferred taxes partially offset by the receipt of a million dividend from the company s equity investment in ttx company in march as well as lower merger  separation and environmental clean up payments 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities during was  million consisting of  million in capital expenditures as described below  and million of other investing activities which primarily include retired track structure removal costs  participation in joint investment projects and advances for future investment transactions 
the increase in other investing activities compared to was principally due to an increase in joint investment projects and advances for future investment transactions 
a breakdown of cash capital expenditures is set forth in the following table in millions year ended december  maintenance of way mechanical information services other total maintenance of business    new locomotives and freight cars expansion and other total    bnsf reduced cash capital expenditures compared with by approximately million to  million 
cash used for new locomotives was lower in reflecting a decrease in the number of locomotives purchased 
in  new locomotives were delivered to bnsf under long term operating leases compared with locomotives in expansion projects  principally main line track and major facility construction  decreased due a reduced capital program in bnsf has entered into commitments to acquire locomotives in the locomotives will be financed from one or a combination of sources including  but not limited to  cash from operations  capital or operating leases  and debt issuances 
the decision on the method used will depend upon then current market conditions and other factors 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities during was million  principally consisting of share repurchases of  million and dividend payments of million partially offset by net debt borrowings of  million 
in february  a put option on million of medium term notes paying a coupon of percent was exercised by the holders and the company repaid the holders primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper 
in april  bnsf issued million of percent notes due april and million of percent debentures due april the net proceeds of the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper which increased primarily as a result of higher share repurchases 
at the time of issuing the million of percent notes and the million of percent debentures discussed above  the company closed out two treasury lock transactions  each in an amount of million  at gains of approximately million and million  respectively  which have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the lives of the notes and the debentures  respectively 
subsequent to this debt issuance  the company had no remaining capacity under the february shelf registration statement 
in april  bnsf railway issued million of privately placed debt collateralized by locomotives that were acquired in this debt carries an interest rate of percent and matures from april to in may  the company filed a new shelf registration statement that became effective during may for the issuance of debt securities which may be issued in one or more series at an aggregate offering price not to exceed billion

in april  the holder of a call option on million of the company s puttable reset debentures due exercised the call option 
as a result  on may   the holder repurchased the debentures which were subsequently resold to investors 
the interest rate on the debentures was reset to a fixed interest rate of percent 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the resale of these debentures 
aggregate long term debt scheduled to mature in is million 
bnsf s ratio of total debt to total capital was percent at the end of  percent at the end of  and percent at the end of the increase in over the prior year is attributable to the increase in debt and lower equity due primarily to higher share repurchases  as discussed below 
credit agreements bnsf issues commercial paper from time to time which is supported by bank revolving credit agreements 
outstanding commercial paper balances are considered as reducing the amount of borrowings available under these agreements 
the bank revolving credit agreements  which were renewed and extended effective june   allow borrowings of up to billion on a short term basis an increase of million over the prior agreement and million on a long term basis 
annual facility fees are currently percent and percent  respectively  and are subject to change based upon changes in bnsf s senior unsecured debt ratings 
borrowing rates are based upon i libor plus a spread determined by bnsf s senior unsecured debt ratings  ii money market rates offered at the option of the lenders  or iii an alternate base rate 
the company generally classifies commercial paper as long term to the extent of its commitments available under the revolving credit agreements 
the commitments of the lenders under the short term agreement are scheduled to expire in june  with the ability for any amounts then outstanding to mature as late as june the commitments of the lenders under the long term agreement are scheduled to expire in june bnsf also had outstanding bank borrowings at december   with maturity values of million and interest rates similar to commercial paper which  upon maturity  may be replaced with commercial paper or other bank borrowings 
there were no bank borrowings outstanding at december  at december  there were no borrowings against the revolving credit agreements and the maturity value of commercial paper outstanding was million  leaving a total capacity of  million available under the revolving credit agreements 
bnsf must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under its revolving credit agreements and at december   the company was in compliance 
common stock repurchase program in july  the board of directors of bnsf authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market 
in december  april and september  the board of directors authorized extensions of the bnsf share repurchase program  adding million shares at each date to the total shares previously authorized 
during  and  the company repurchased approximately million  million  and million shares  respectively  of its common stock at average prices of per share  per share  and per share  respectively 
there were no repurchases under this program in total repurchases through january   were million shares at a total average cost of per share  leaving million shares available for repurchase out of the million shares authorized 
in connection with its share repurchase program  in april  bnsf sold equity put options for million shares of common stock to an independent third party and received cash proceeds of million 
the third party exercised the options on october   which resulted in the company purchasing million shares of its common stock at per share 
the company accounts for the effects of equity put option transactions within stockholders equity 
during  there were no sales of equity put options 
an equity put option is a financial instrument whereby bnsf receives an upfront cash premium for granting another party the option to sell a defined number of bnsf shares to the company at a fixed price on a specified future date 
the company considers the sale of equity put options as a method to acquire its common stock at a share price consistent with its share repurchase strategy and potentially reduce the all in cost of the program 
the company s risk is that it may be required to purchase shares at a specified price that is higher than the common stock price at the exercise date of the equity put option 
the company has the ability to settle its equity put option transactions on a net share or net cash basis and accounts for the effects of these transactions within stockholders equity 
the number of shares subject to outstanding put options sold by the company cannot exceed the amount of remaining shares the board of directors has authorized for repurchase 
as of january   there were no equity put options outstanding

dividends common stock dividends declared were per share annually for and and per share annually in dividends paid on common stock were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of cents per share upon outstanding shares of common stock  
par value  payable april   to stockholders of record on march  other matters casualty and environmental personal injury claims  including work related injuries to employees  are a significant expense for the railroad industry 
employees of bnsf are compensated for work related injuries according to the provisions of the federal employers liability act fela 
fela s system of requiring the finding of fault  coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury system  contributed to significant increases in expense in past years 
bnsf has implemented a number of safety programs to reduce the number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury expense 
bnsf made payments for personal injuries of approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million related to both asserted and unasserted personal injury claims 
as discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company s operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
bnsf s operating procedures include practices to protect the environment from the risks inherent in railroad operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
additionally  many of bnsf s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf is subject to environmental clean up and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as the superfund law  as well as similar state laws generally impose joint and several liability for clean up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
bnsf has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp for study and clean up costs at approximately superfund sites for which investigation and remediation payments are or will be made or are yet to be determined the superfund sites and  in many instances  is one of several prps 
in addition  bnsf may be considered a prp under certain other laws 
accordingly  under cercla and other federal and state statutes  bnsf may be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with a particular site 
if there are other prps  bnsf generally participates in the clean up of these sites through cost sharing agreements with terms that vary from site to site 
costs are typically allocated based on relative volumetric contribution of material  the amount of time the site was owned or operated  and or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each prp 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites as well as costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated 
liabilities for environmental clean up costs are initially recorded when bnsf s liability for environmental clean up is both probable and a reasonable estimate of associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
bnsf conducts an ongoing environmental contingency analysis  which considers a combination of factors including independent consulting reports  site visits  legal reviews  analysis of the likelihood of participation in and the ability of other prps to pay for clean up  and historical trend analyses 
bnsf is involved in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings and other mandatory clean up efforts at approximately sites  including the superfund sites  at which it is participating in the study or clean up  or both  of alleged environmental contamination 
bnsf paid approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively  for mandatory and unasserted clean up efforts  including amounts expended under federal and state voluntary clean up programs 
the company had recorded liabilities for remediation and restoration of all known sites of approximately million at december   compared with million at december  bnsf anticipates that the majority of the accrued costs at december   will be paid over the next five years 
no individual site is considered to be material 
liabilities recorded for environmental costs represent bnsf s best estimates for remediation and restoration of these sites and include both asserted and unasserted claims 
unasserted claims are not considered to be a material component of the liability 
although recorded liabilities include bnsf s best estimates of all costs  without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties  bnsf s total clean up costs at these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of corrective actions that may be required  evolving environmental laws and regulations  advances in environmental technology  the extent of other parties participation in clean up efforts  developments in ongoing environmental analyses related to sites determined to be contaminated  and developments in environmental surveys and studies of potentially contaminated sites 
as a result  future charges to income for environmental liabilities could have a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year as individual site studies and remediation and restoration efforts proceed or as new sites arise 
however  management believes that it is unlikely that any identified matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on bnsf s consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity

at december   million of the remaining liabilities are included within current liabilities for anticipated costs to be paid in hedging activities fuel historically  fuel expenses have approximated percent of total operating expenses  however  fuel costs during represented percent of total operating expenses due to significantly higher than historical fuel prices which have continued to date into due to the significance of diesel fuel expenses to the operations of bnsf and the historical volatility of fuel prices  the company maintains a program to hedge against fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases 
the intent of the program is to protect the company s operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes by entering into fuel hedge instruments based on management s evaluation of current and expected diesel fuel price trends 
however  to the extent the company hedges portions of its fuel purchases  it may not realize the impact of decreases in fuel prices 
conversely  to the extent the company does not hedge portions of its fuel purchases  it may be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices 
the fuel hedging program includes the use of commodity swap transactions that are accounted for as hedges 
any gains or losses associated with changes in the market value of the fuel swaps are deferred and recognized as a component of fuel expense in the period in which the fuel is purchased and used 
based on fuel consumption and excluding the impact of the hedging program  each one cent increase in the price of fuel would result in approximately million of additional fuel expense on an annual basis 
as of january   bnsf had entered into fuel swaps for approximately million gallons at an average price of approximately cents per gallon 
the above price does not include taxes  transportation costs  certain other fuel handling costs  and any differences which may occur from time to time between the prices of commodities hedged and the purchase price of bnsf s diesel fuel 
currently  bnsf s fuel hedging program covers approximately percent and percent of estimated annual fuel purchases for and  respectively 
hedge positions are closely monitored to ensure that they will not exceed actual fuel requirements in any period 
unrecognized gains from bnsf s fuel swap transactions were approximately million as of december   of which million relates to swap transactions that will expire in bnsf also monitors its hedging positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
receivables from fuel hedging activities of million and million at december  and  respectively  are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet as part of other current assets and represent settled fuel hedging contracts 
interest rate from time to time  the company enters into various interest rate hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and establishing rates in anticipation of future debt issuances

at the time of issuing the million of percent notes and the million of percent debentures in april  the company closed out two treasury lock transactions with expiration dates in  each in an amount of million one based on the year and one based on the year rates  at gains of approximately million and million  respectively  which have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the year and year lives of the notes and the debentures  respectively 
at the time of issuing the million of percent debentures in august and the million of percent notes in december  the company closed out two treasury lock transactions  each in an amount of million one based on the year and one based on the year rates and both with expiration dates in june  at gains of million and million  respectively  which have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the year and year lives of the debentures and notes  respectively

labor labor unions represent approximately percent of bnsf railway s employees under collective bargaining agreements with different labor organizations 
the negotiating process for new  major collective bargaining agreements covering all of bnsf railway s union employees has been underway since the bargaining round was initiated november  wages  health and welfare benefits  work rules  and other issues have traditionally been addressed through industry wide negotiations 
these negotiations have generally taken place over a number of months and have previously not resulted in any extended work stoppages 
the existing agreements remained in effect through the end of the year  and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act s procedures which include mediation  cooling off periods  and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted 
the current agreements provide for periodic wage increases until new agreements are reached 
the national carriers conference committee  bnsf s multi employer collective bargaining representative  during the third quarter of reached a tentative agreement with the united transportation union utu covering wage and work rule issues through the year for conductors  brakemen  yardmen  yardmasters and firemen approximately one third of bnsf s unionized workforce 
the agreement is subject to ratification by the utu s membership 
health and welfare benefit issues were not resolved by this agreement  and will remain the subject of continuing negotiations 
inflation due to the capital intensive nature of bnsf s business  the full effect of inflation is not reflected in operating expenses because depreciation is based on historical cost 
an assumption that all operating assets were depreciated at current price levels would result in substantially greater expense than historically reported amounts 
accounting pronouncements bnsf adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 beginning january  sfas no 
 as amended  requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting and  if it does  the type of hedge transaction 
for qualifying cash flow hedge transactions in which the company is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable rate asset  liability  or a forecasted transaction  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be reported in other comprehensive income to the extent it offsets changes in the cash flows related to the variable rate asset  liability or forecasted transaction  with the difference reported in current period earnings 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified in earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current period earnings 
based on fuel hedging instruments outstanding at january  and previously deferred net gains from past interest rate hedging transactions  all of which are cash flow hedge transactions  the company will record a net of tax cumulative effect benefit to accumulated other comprehensive deficit in the company s consolidated balance sheet of approximately million on adoption in the first quarter because the company s derivative instruments historically have been highly effective in hedging the exposure to changes in cash flows associated with forecasted purchases of diesel fuel and changes in the risk free rate of interest on anticipated issuances of long term debt  we do not expect the adoption of sfas  as amended  to have a material impact on our future results of operations 
although bnsf expects the derivative instruments it currently uses to hedge to continue to be highly effective  if they are determined not to be highly effective in the future  or if the company uses derivative instruments that do not meet the stringent requirements for hedge accounting under sfas  as amended  then future earnings could reflect greater volatility 
additionally  if a cash flow hedge is discontinued because the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur  any gain or loss in accumulated comprehensive income associated with the hedged transaction will be immediately recognized in net income

interest rate sensitivity the tables below provide information about bnsf s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and for debt obligations  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date

the bank revolving credit agreements which were renewed and extended effective june   allow borrowings of up to billion on a short term basis and million on a long term basis 
the commitments of the lenders under the short term agreement are scheduled to expire in june with the ability for any amounts then outstanding to mature as late as june the commitments of the lenders under the long term agreement are scheduled to expire in june bnsf classified commercial paper and bank borrowings as long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december  and the bank borrowings have maturities and interest rates similar to commercial paper  which upon maturity  may be replaced with commercial paper or other bank borrowings

commodity price sensitivity historically  fuel expenses have approximated percent of total operating expenses  however  fuel costs during represent percent of total operating expenses due to significantly higher fuel prices 
due to the significance of diesel fuel expenses to the operations of bnsf and the historical volatility of fuel prices  the company maintains a program to hedge against fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases 
the intent of the program is to protect the company s operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes by entering into fuel hedge instruments based on management s evaluation of current and expected diesel fuel price trends 
however  to the extent the company hedges portions of its fuel purchases  it may not realize the impact of decreases in fuel prices 
conversely  to the extent the company does not hedge portions of its fuel purchases  it may be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices 
the fuel hedging program includes the use of commodity swap transactions that are accounted for as hedges 
any gains or losses associated with changes in the market value of the fuel swaps are deferred and recognized as a component of fuel expense in the period in which the fuel is purchased and used 
swap transactions are typically based on the price of pipeline delivery of gulf coast heating oil and require bnsf to purchase a defined quantity at a defined price 
swap transactions are generally settled with the counterparty in cash 
based on historical information  bnsf believes there is a significant correlation between the market prices of diesel fuel and gulf coast heating oil 
the tables below provide information about bnsf s diesel fuel hedging instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices 
the tables present notional amounts in gallons and the weighted average contract price by contractual maturity date 
the prices included in the tables do not include taxes  transportation costs  certain other fuel handling costs and any differences which may occur from time to time between the prices of commodities hedged and the purchase price of bnsf s diesel fuel 
maturity december  date fair total value diesel fuel swaps gallons in millions weighted average price per gallon december  maturity date fair total value diesel fuel swaps gallons in millions weighted average price per gallon represents unrecognized gains in millions based on the price of gulf coast heating oil 
additionally  at december  and  bnsf maintained fuel inventories for use in normal operations which were not material to bnsfs overall financial position and therefore represent no significant market exposure 
equity price sensitivity in april  bnsf sold equity put options for million shares of bnsf common stock to an independent third party and received cash proceeds of million 
the third party exercised the options on october   which resulted in the company purchasing million shares of its common stock at per share 
as of december  there were no equity put options outstanding 
an equity put option is a financial instrument whereby bnsf receives an upfront cash premium for granting another party the option to sell a defined number of bnsf shares to the company at a fixed price on a specified future date 
the company considers the sale of equity put options as a method to acquire its common stock at a share price consistent with its share repurchase strategy and potentially reduce the all in cost of the program 
the company s risk is that it may be required to purchase shares at a specified price that is higher than the common stock price at the exercise date of the equity put option 
the company has the ability to settle its equity put option transactions on a net share or net cash basis and accounts for the effects of these transactions within stockholders equity 
the number of shares subject to outstanding put options sold by the company cannot exceed the amount of remaining shares the board of directors has authorized for repurchase
