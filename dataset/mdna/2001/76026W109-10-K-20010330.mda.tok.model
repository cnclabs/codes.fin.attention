selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or from million in to million in reptron display and system integration accounted for approximately  of the increase in the remaining increase was primarily due to investments in sales operations  management information systems and engineers 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased  or from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributed to a million increase in average outstanding net debt  from million during to million during currency fluctuation reptron pays for its purchases from foreign sources  including asian manufacturers  in us dollars  which reduces the adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
reptron has not experienced substantial adverse effects from currency fluctuations to date 
liquidity and capital resources reptron primarily finances its operations through subordinated notes  bank credit lines  capital equipment leases  and short term financing through supplier credit lines 
net cash provided by or used in operating activities has historically been driven by net income loss levels combined with fluctuations in inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
operating activities for used cash of approximately million 
this decrease in liquidity resulted primarily from an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
these items were offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
days sales in accounts receivable as of december  were approximately days 
annualized inventory turns for were times 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million in these capital expenditures were primarily for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment and building improvements 
these purchases were funded by our working capital credit facility and a three year  fixed rate capital lease for approximately million 
five lenders have made available to the company a million revolving credit facility credit agreement through january  borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by all inventory  accounts receivable  equipment and general intangibles 
the credit agreement limits the amount of capital expenditures and prohibits the payment of dividends thereby restricting the distribution of retained earnings 
the credit agreement provides for  upon notice to the lender  advancement of funds pursuant to either a domestic rate loan variable at the prime rate  at december  or a eurodollar rate loan based on the libor rate plus an indexed spread at december  
upon notice to the lenders  advances may be converted from one type of loan to the other 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
under borrowing advance formulas provided for under the credit agreement  as of december   the company was able to borrow the full credit facility available under the credit agreement 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  were approximately million 
management believes that available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital needs of our operations as presently conducted 
however  future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including the level of business in existing operations  expansion of facilities  and possible acquisitions 
while there can be no assurance that such financing will be available in amounts and on acceptable terms  management believes that such financing would likely be available on acceptable terms 
new accounting pronouncements on december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
this sab was effective during the fourth quarter of for the company 
the company s adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on revenue or earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december   we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
approximately half of our borrowings bear a fixed interest rate 
however  borrowings under our bank credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate 
based on the average floating rate borrowings outstanding throughout  a basis point change in the interest rates would have caused reptron s interest expense  net of the income tax effect  to change by approximately  reptron believes that this amount is not significant to the results of operations
