item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general whole foods market opened its first store in texas in and has expanded its operations to stores as of september  both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties 
we operate in one reportable segment  natural foods supermarkets 
we currently have one store in development in toronto  canada 
all of our remaining operations are domestic 
our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings 
new stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation  although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations 
our results of operations are reported on a or week year ending on the last sunday in september 
fiscal year is a week year  and fiscal years and are week years 
in november  the company adopted a plan to dispose of the naturesmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements 
accordingly  the naturesmart business and related net assets have been recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all years presented 
the following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the statements of operations data of whole foods market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening and relocation costs amortization expense store closure and asset disposal costs operating income other income expense interest expense investment and other income loss income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates provision for income taxes equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes gain loss on disposal  net of income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income taxes net income loss figures may not add due to rounding 
sales sales from continuing operations increased  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
adjusted to reflect a fifty two week period in fiscal year  sales from continuing operations increased 
sales for all years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired 
identical store sales  which exclude relocations  increased approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
comparable and identical store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts  reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market 
these increases are due to such factors as improvements in overall store execution and increased sales of private label products 
gross profit gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations 
our gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was   and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
these increases reflect increased national buying  category management and private label initiatives  which lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis 
additionally  continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement  merchandising and controlling shrink has contributed to these increases in gross profit 
in all years  gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature 
relative to other stores in a region  gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature  reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase  as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams 
gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the increased percentage of sales in certain regions and in certain departments such as prepared foods where we achieve higher gross profits 
gross profit margins were negatively affected in fiscal year by an increase in utilities expense as a percentage of sales of approximately basis points 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were in and in both fiscal years and for fiscal year  general and administrative expenses reflect increases in wage costs and depreciation from investments in information systems 
these increases were partially offset by an overall decrease in direct store expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses reflect higher direct store expenses as a percentage of sales and a greater percentage of our total sales at new and acquired stores added over the prior year 
in fiscal year we incurred additional general and administrative costs related to the implementation of new management information systems and procedures required to address our potential year issues 
whole foods market has historically been able to expand without a significant increase in general and administrative costs 
pre opening and relocation costs pre opening costs include hiring and training personnel  supplies  and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings and are incurred primarily in the thirty days prior to a new store opening 
relocation costs consist of moving costs  remaining lease payments  accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities and other related expenses 
we adopted aicpa statement of position sop reporting on the costs of start up activities effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year in accordance with sop  in the first quarter of fiscal year we have reported the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a one time charge totaling approximately  after taxes  representing start up costs capitalized at september  in fiscal year and prior years  we capitalized pre opening costs as incurred and subsequently expensed such amounts in the quarter of the location opening 
whole foods market developed and opened twelve stores in fiscal year  seventeen stores in fiscal year  and nine stores in fiscal year of these  two stores were relocations in fiscal year  three stores were relocations in fiscal year  and one store was a relocation in fiscal year pre opening and relocation costs were approximately million million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
amortization expense amortization expense consists primarily of costs associated with the amortization of excess of cost over net assets acquired and non competition agreements 
amortization expense from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was in both fiscal years and and in fiscal year store closure and asset disposal costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recognized store closure costs totaling approximately million related to the decision to close three locations  all of which were previously acquired in multi store transactions 
store closure costs include writedowns of leasehold improvements and store equipment to estimated fair values totaling approximately million and estimated lease termination costs and other disposal costs totaling approximately million 
termination of leases will be completed as soon as is practicable after the related stores are closed during fiscal year we expect to complete substantially all other activities related to these store closures in fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recognized asset disposal costs totaling approximately million 
costs associated with the disposal of accounting and distribution software which was replaced with the implementation of new financial software totaled approximately million 
costs associated with other hardware and software disposals totaled approximately million and consisted of the writeoffs of certain year non compliant or obsolete hardware and certain software under development that we determined would not be placed in service 
substantially all activities related to the asset disposals were completed in fiscal year interest expense interest expense consists of costs related to our convertible subordinated debentures  senior notes and bank line of credit  net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software 
interest expense related to our company s borrowings  net of amounts capitalized  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the annual increases in net interest expense are due primarily to additional amounts outstanding under our bank line of credit and the semi annual compounding of interest on our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures 
investment and other income loss investment and other income loss for fiscal year and includes interest  rental and other income totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  we determined that our preferred stock investment in american wholehealth  inc had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary 
as a result  we recognized a million pre tax loss in fiscal year associated with the writeoff of this investment 
investment and other income for fiscal year consists primarily of interest income earned on a short term corporate bond portfolio and a prime money market portfolio 
income taxes our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects the capital loss associated with the writeoff of our million investment in american wholehealth  inc and a corresponding valuation allowance that was established on the related deferred tax asset 
excluding the impact of this investment loss  our effective rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal year was approximately 
at september   we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million 
we consider it more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized 
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates represents our share of losses of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee 
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of the writedown of our investment in gaiam 
com to its estimated fair value and our share of gaiam 
com losses 
during fiscal year  we determined that our investment in gaiam

com to its estimated fair value 
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of our share of wholepeople

in may  we completed the sale of all of our interest in naturesmart for approximately million in cash 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  we completed the sale of the facility in thornton  colorado that was used by naturesmart for approximately million in cash 
the gain on disposal of approximately million in fiscal year consists primarily of proceeds from these sales in excess of the amounts previously estimated and a reduction in the estimated future liabilities of the discontinued operations  net of taxes 
net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year was approximately million 
net income from discontinued operations in fiscal year was approximately million 
business combinations in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets of natural abilities  inc  which operated three natural foods supermarkets in the sonoma county  california area  in exchange for approximately million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition

total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill 
quarterly results the first quarter consists of weeks  the second and third quarters each consist of weeks and the fourth quarter consists of or weeks 
fiscal year is a week year with the fourth quarter consisting of weeks 
fiscal year is a week year with the fourth quarter consisting of weeks 
because the first quarter is longer than the remaining quarters and contains both the thanksgiving and christmas holidays  it typically represents a larger share of our annual sales from existing stores 
quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings 
we believe that the historical pattern of quarterly sales and income as a percentage of the annual total may not be indicative of the pattern in future years
