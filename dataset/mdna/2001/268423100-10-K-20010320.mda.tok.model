management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the bank s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the board of directors approved guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the bank s board of directors reviews the bank s interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis 
the bank s asset liability committee is comprised of the bank s entire board of directors and members of senior management 
the committee is responsible for reviewing the bank s activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the bank s net interest margin  the market value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in the interest rates will have on the bank s portfolio and the bank s exposure limits 
in recent years  the bank has utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination  purchase and retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans and shorter term fixed rate mortgage loans  consumer loans consisting primarily of home equity lines of credit and short term commercial business loans and investing in short term and adjustable rate securities which may generally bear lower yields as compared to longer term investments  but which better position the bank for increases in market interest rates 
the bank currently does not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
in the event of sharply rising interests rates  the bank has  with retention in mind  competitively priced deposits  particularly time deposits 
as necessary  the bank has offered competitive special products to increase retention 
historically  the bank has retained significant levels of maturing time deposits based on the above practice  as well as effective customer service and long standing relationships with customers 
from january  to december   the bank retained of funds maturing from time deposits 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the bank s one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year as a percentage of total assets  was 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would be in a worse position to invest in higher yielding assets which  consequently  may result in the cost of its interest bearing liabilities increasing at a rate faster than its yield on interest earning assets than if it had a positive gap 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would tend to have its interest bearing liabilities repricing downward at a faster rate than its interest earning assets as compared to an institution with a positive gap which  consequently  may tend to positively affect the growth of its net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the bank  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
for loans on residential properties  adjustable rate loans  and fixed rate loans  actual repricing and maturity dates were used 
mortgage backed securities were assumed to prepay at rates between and annually 
savings accounts were assumed to decay at       and  money market savings accounts were assumed to decay at      and  and now accounts were assumed to decay at      and for the periods of three months or less  three to six months  six to months  one to three years  three to five years  five to ten years and more than ten years  respectively 
these assumptions are generally based on the ots s deposit decay guidelines at december  prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on the bank s estimated gap 
while the bank believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity

investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale are shown at amortized cost 
for purposes of the gap analysis  the allowance for loan losses and non performing loans have been excluded 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
fhlb advances are categorized by maturity date 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
average balance sheet 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the bank for the years ended december   and the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown and reflect annualized yields and costs 
average balances are derived from average monthly balances

loans receivable  net  increased by million  or  to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in loans receivable was attributable to a million increase in the bank s one to four family mortgage loan portfolio  a million increase in the multi family mortgage loan portfolio  and an million increase in the commercial business loan portfolio during the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  investment securities increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the growth in total assets was funded by increases in borrowed money and savings deposits 
borrowed money  representing fhlb advances  increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  savings deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in deposits is largely due to increased marketing and advertising and two new branch offices 
stockholders equity increased by  to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily the result of the company s net income during the period and a million increase in the company s accumulated other comprehensive income relating to its available for sale investment portfolio  offset by stock repurchases and dividends paid 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general 
the company s net income decreased  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with this increase resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets and an increase in average yield 
the largest component was an increase of million in mortgage loan interest income for the year ended december  this resulted from an increase in average balance of million and a slight increase in average yield of basis points 
another large component was an increase of million in other loan interest income for the year ended december  this resulted from an increase in average balance of million and an increase in average yield of basis points 
overall  the average yield on the bank s interest earning assets increased by basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in average yield is due to a general increase in loan rates in the bank s local market area 
the average balance of interest earning assets increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities and an overall increase in the average rate paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid on total deposits increased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the related average balance of deposits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the resulting increase in interest expense on deposits amounted to million for the year ended december  interest expense resulting from borrowed money increased by million 
the average rate paid on borrowed money increased by basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase in average rate paid was in addition to an increase of million in the average balance of borrowed money to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net interest income before provision for loan losses 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in average interest earning assets  at an average yield of  offset by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  at an average cost of 
this combination resulted in a decline on interest rate spread of basis points to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in interest rate spread is due to a general increase in rates in the bank s local market area as well as deposits repricing faster than loans 
the net interest margin as a percent of interest earning assets decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the comparable period in this decrease is due to increases in both interest earning assets and noninterest bearing liabilities and a decrease in interest rate spread 
provision for loan losses 
the bank s provision for loan losses increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  in at december  and  non performing loans totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and the balance of the allowance for loan losses totaled and million  respectively 
at december   the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was compared to at december  the increase in nonperforming loans is primarily due to one million first mortgage loan secured by a commercial office building located in st 
charles  illinois 
this loan had a valuation reserve of  at december  there were no impaired loans at december  the ratio of the allowance to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
net charge offs totaled  and  in and  respectively 
management periodically calculates an allowance sufficiency analysis based upon the portfolio composition  asset classifications  loan to value ratios  impairments in the current loan portfolio  and other factors 
this analysis is designed to reflect credit losses for specifically identified loans  as well as credit losses in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the reserve methodology employed by management reflects the difference in degree of risk between the various categories of loans in the bank s portfolio 
the reserve methodology also critically assesses those loans adversely classified in the portfolio by management as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
these allowance components are set at a higher factor than the non classified one to four family loans in the portfolio to reflect the greater level of risk to which management believes the bank is exposed 
management believes that the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses are currently adequate to cover probable losses in the existing loan portfolio 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurance can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  further information obtained regarding problem loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of management s control 
noninterest income 
noninterest income totalled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
insurance and brokerage commissions increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period in gains on sale of securities increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period in other income increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a loss on the sale of foreclosed real estate of  in  there were no sales in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased by  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in compensation and benefits increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a combination of annual salary increases  the addition of staff due in part to two new branch offices and an increase in employee health insurance costs 
the additional staff expenses are primarily attributed to the opening of two new branch offices and the hiring of marketing and human resource personnel 
all other operating expenses  including advertising  depreciation and repairs  marketing  insurance  postage  communications  data processing and other office expense increased by a combined  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in of this increase   is related to additional imaging expenses for now accounts and  of marketing and advertising expenses relating to two new branch offices and increased advertising for fox valley financial services  inc  the bank s wholly owned subsidiary  which offers a full range of investment products 
income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in the provision for income taxes was the result of a decrease in pretax income of  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the effective income tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the preceding year 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general 
the company s net income increased million  to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was impacted by the recognition of a one time million pre tax million after tax expense related to the establishment of the elgin financial foundation the foundation as part of the bank s conversion in from mutual to stock form the conversion 
net income of the company  excluding the one time  non recurring contribution to the foundation  amounted to million for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in this increase resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets offset by a decrease in average yield 
the largest component was an increase of million in mortgage loan interest income for the year ended december  this resulted from an increase in average balance of million  partly the result of loans purchased during the year totaling million  offset by a decrease in average yield of basis points 
this was further offset by a decrease of  in investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale  short term deposits and fhlb stock interest income 
this resulted from a decrease in average balance of million offset by an increase in average yield of basis points 
overall  the average yield on the bank s interest earning assets decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in average yield is due to a general decline in interest rates 
the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  offset by an overall decrease in the average rate paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid on total deposits decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the average balance of deposits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this resulted in a level of interest expense on deposits of million for and the larger increase came in the area of fhlb advances 
interest expense resulting from borrowed money increased by million 
the average rate paid on borrowed money decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in average rate was offset by an increase of million in the average balance of borrowed money to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net interest income before provision for loan losses 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributed to a million increase in average interest earning assets  at an average yield of  offset by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  at an average cost of 
this combination resulted in an increase on interest rate spread of basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase in interest rate spread is due to a lower cost of deposits in the bank s local market area 
the net interest margin as a percent of interest earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the comparable period in provision for loan losses

noninterest expense decreased by million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the noninterest expense in was impacted by the company establishing the foundation with a one time million non recurring pre tax donation  as part of the conversion 
this donation was funded with authorized but unissued common stock immediately following the conversion 
this contribution amounted to of the common stock sold 
compensation and benefits increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a combination of annual salary increases  the adoption of a stock award plan  which was approved in october and the adoption of and employee stock ownership plan  which was established in in connection with the conversion 
in addition  the full service facility  which opened in huntley was completely staffed  as well as other employee additions throughout the bank 
all other operating expenses  including advertising  depreciation and repairs  marketing  postage  communications  data processing and other office expense increased by a combined  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in of this increase   is related to advertising  which was due to the grand opening of the huntley facility as well as additional promotion of the bank s subsidiary fox valley financial services  inc   of depreciation   of office building expenses  and  of data processing expense 
management continues to emphasize the importance of expense management and control in order to continue to provide expanded banking services to a growing market base 
income tax expense 
income tax totaled million for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in the increase in the provision for income taxes was the result of an increase in pretax income of million to million for the year ended december  from  for the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to the one time non recurring million donation made to establish the foundation 
liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are savings deposits  proceeds from the principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from the maturation of securities and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from fhlb chicago 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the primary investing activities of the bank are the origination of primarily residential one to four family loans and  to a lesser extent  multi family and commercial real estate  construction and land  commercial and consumer loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and mortgage related securities 
during the years ended december    and  the bank s loan originations totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the bank purchased loans totaling million  million and million for the same time periods 
these activities were funded primarily by deposit growth  fhlb advances and principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank experienced a net increase decrease in total deposits of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  fhlb advances increased million  million and million  respectively for the same time periods 
deposit flows are affected by the level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by the local competitors and the bank  and other factors 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and interest bearing demand accounts 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and interest bearing demand accounts totaled million  or of total assets 
the bank closely monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
on a longer term basis  the bank maintains a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under item to this annual report 
in the event the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through fhlb advances 
at december   the bank had million of outstanding fhlb borrowings 
outstanding commitments to originate first mortgage loans totaled million at december  management of the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totaled million 
from december  to december   the bank experienced an retention rate of funds maturing from certificates of deposit 
it has been and will continue to be a priority of management to retain time deposits 
the bank relies primarily on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to retain deposits 
from time to time  the bank will also offer competitive special products to its customers to increase retention 
based upon the bank s experience with deposit retention and current retention strategies  management believes that  although it is not possible to predict future terms and conditions upon renewal  a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a leverage capital level of million  or of adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and risk based capital of million  or of adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
the capital injection resulting from the conversion in of million significantly increased liquidity and capital resources 
a portion of the net proceeds were invested in marketable securities 
the initial level of liquidity has been reduced as net proceeds are utilized for general corporate purposes  including the funding of lending activities and expansion of facilities and to a greater degree the repurchase of the company s common stock 
these repurchases totaled million as of december  impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june sfas no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately

sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  was issued by the fasb in september sfas no 
supercedes and replaces fasb sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  sfas no 
is now the authoritative accounting literature for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
also includes several additional disclosure requirements in the area of securitized financial assets and collateral arrangements 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to transfers of financial assets are to be applied to all transfers of assets occurring after march  the collateral recognition and disclosure provisions in sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending december  the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a net portfolio value model which generates estimates of the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates similar to the assumptions utilized for the gap table 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher the institution s sensitivity ratio  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the following npv table sets forth the bank s npv as of december  npv as of portfolio value of assets change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net portfolio value amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands static  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results
