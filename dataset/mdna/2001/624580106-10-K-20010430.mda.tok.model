general wholesale sales 
among the more significant factors that influence annual sales are general economic conditions in the company s domestic and international markets  new product introductions  the level and effectiveness of advertising and marketing expenditures  and product pricing decisions 
approximately of the company s total sales are from international markets and therefore reported sales are affected by foreign exchange rates 
significant portions of the company s international sales are billed in swiss francs and translated to us dollars at average exchange rates for financial reporting purposes 
the company s business is very seasonal 
there are two major selling seasons in the company s domestic markets the spring season  which includes school graduations and several holidays  and  most importantly  the christmas and holiday season 
major selling seasons in certain international markets center around significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
these markets are a less significant portion of the company s business and  therefore  their impact is far less than that of the selling seasons in north america 
during fiscal  the company completed the sale of both the piaget and corum distribution businesses and substantially all the assets associated with these businesses 
prior to the sale  the company had been the exclusive distributor of these brands in north america 
the company completed the sale of its piaget business to vlg in february and sold its corum business to corum switzerland in january the disposition of these brands negatively impacted sales in fiscal retail sales 
the company s retail operations consist of outlet stores located throughout the us and seven full priced movado boutiques 
the company does not have any overseas retail operations 
the significant factors that influence annual sales volumes in the company s retail operations are similar to those that influence domestic wholesale operations 
in addition  many of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations and  therefore  the seasonality of these stores is driven by the peak tourist season associated with these locations 
gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors sales mix  product pricing strategy  manufacturing costs and the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
gross margins vary among the brands included in the company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand 
luxury and premium retail price point models generally earn lower gross margins than more popular moderate price models 
gross margins in the company s outlet business are lower than those of the wholesale business since the outlets primarily sell seconds and discontinued models that generally command lower retail prices 
gross margins in the full priced movado boutiques exceed those of the wholesale business since the company earns full channel margins from manufacture to point of sale in this business 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is  therefore  to some extent  constrained by competitors actions 
in addition  the company s wholesale operation periodically engages in liquidation sales of discontinued models at reduced prices 
the level of these sales in a particular period can also have a significant impact on the company s gross margins 
manufacturing costs of the company s brands consist primarily of component costs  internal and subcontractor assembly costs and unit overhead costs associated with the company s supply chain operations in the us  switzerland and the far east 
the company seeks to control and reduce component and subcontractor labor costs through a combination of negotiations with existing suppliers and alternative sourcing 
the company s supply chain operations consist of logistics management of assembly operations and product sourcing in switzerland and the far east and minor assembly in the us the company has historically controlled the level of overhead costs and maintained flexibility in its cost structure by outsourcing a significant portion of its component and assembly requirements and expects to extend this strategy over the near term 
since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s production costs and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company  therefore  hedges its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts  purchased currency options and spot purchases 
the company s hedging program has  in the recent past  been reasonably successful in stabilizing product costs and therefore gross margins despite exchange rate fluctuations 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of advertising  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses 
annual advertising expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various markets around the world in which the company sells its products 
selling expenses consist primarily of sales commissions  sales force costs and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary proportionally with overall sales levels 
retail operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and store rents 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  the cost of part time help to meet seasonal needs  and shipping costs and supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs and various other general corporate expenses 
operating expenses over the last three fiscal years reflect the effect of the implementation of the company s growth strategy 
the more significant expenses associated with this strategy include advertising and marketing expenses designed to increase market share for all of the company s watch brands  both domestically and internationally  additions to the company s sales force  salaries and rents associated with additional outlet stores and the movado boutiques  the addition of staff to support distribution  inventory management and customer service requirements coincident with growth of the company s business  and general and administrative expenses  such as employee benefits and the development of the company s information systems infrastructure

other net domestic sales  which includes the company s outlet stores  movado boutiques and after sales service business  increased over the prior year

other net sales  which includes the company s outlet stores  movado boutiques and after sales service business  increased over the prior year

gross margins 
the gross margin for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal gross margin increases reflect the improvements the company initiated in fiscal these improvements included the improved availability of core range products  higher margins on new model introductions  reduction of product acquisition costs mainly due to the strength of the us dollar against the swiss franc and significant reduction of liquidation sales 
the gross margin increase was also due to one time charges of million made in fiscal to write down non core component inventories and the million book to physical inventory adjustment during fiscal the company s gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the one time charge of million to write down non core component inventories and million book to physical inventory adjustments

the increase in advertising costs were the results of an increase of million in the movado boutiques and cooperative advertising programs offset by a decrease of expenditures for special events  point of sale support material such as displays and product brochures and media advertising programs 
increases in advertising expenses at the movado boutiques reflect the costs associated with new business initiatives 
selling expenses increased in both the company s wholesale and retail businesses 
increases in selling expenses in the wholesale business primarily reflects higher levels of sales commissions due to sales increases in the movado brands and increases in head count to support the launch of the tommy hilfiger line 
increases in selling expenses associated with the company s retail operations relate primarily to the addition of one new outlet and two new movado boutiques in fiscal as well as the annualized cost of stores opened during fiscal distribution expenses are largely variable in nature and these expenses grew proportionately with increases in unit volume shipments offset by a nonrecurring charge of million made in fiscal  for expenses related to the relocation of the company s us distribution operations 
increases in general and administrative expenses were substantially due to the recording of a management bonus as a result of exceeding corporate performance targets  a moving and relocation expense associated with the shutdown of the distribution and service center in lyndhurst  nj and costs associated with new business initiatives including staffing costs for the launch of the tommy hilfiger brand  movado boutiques and company outlet stores

headcount increases in the coach and esq brands to support growth also resulted in increased compensation and travel expenses 
selling expenses for fiscal also reflect the first year of amortization of the company s major trade show exhibition facility constructed for use at the annual basel international watch and jewelry show 
increases in selling expenses associated with the company s retail operations relate primarily to the addition of four new outlets and one new movado boutique in fiscal as well as the annualization of cost of stores opened during fiscal increases in distribution expenses include a nonrecurring charge associated with the planned relocation of the company s us distribution operations 
the remaining increase is due to the variable nature of distribution expenses which grew proportionately with increases in unit volume shipments 
increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily in the area of human resources and information systems 
the company experienced increases in employee benefit costs associated with a growing workforce as well as recruiting fees  specifically associated with the hiring of two senior executives in the fourth quarter

the company believes that the near term future effective tax rate will stabilize in the to range reflecting the company s current expectation that domestic earnings will gradually increase as a percentage of the overall earnings mix 
however  there can be no assurance of this result as it is dependent on a number of factors  including the mix of foreign to domestic earnings  local statutory tax rates and the company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions
