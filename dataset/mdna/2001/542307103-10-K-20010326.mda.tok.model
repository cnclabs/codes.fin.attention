the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle represents the effect of adoption of statement of position  reporting on costs of start up activities 
this statement impacted the company s accounting for pre opening costs see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and labor costs 
a large number of the company s restaurant personnel are paid at federal and state established minimum wage levels and  accordingly  changes in such wage levels affect the company s labor costs 
as costs of food and labor have increased  the company has historically been able to offset these increases through economies of scale and improved operating procedures  although there is no assurance that such offsets will continue 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins

in the second quarter of fiscal  the company began paying dividends on its common stock 
for the year  the company paid cash dividends of  or per share 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
the interpretation requires  among other things  that stock options which have been modified after december  to reduce the exercise price must be accounted for as variable 
the company has adopted the accounting change for modified stock options on a prospective basis effective july   as required by the interpretation 
pursuant to the rules for the initial application of the interpretation  imputed non cash compensation expense is to be recognized on a prospective basis to the extent that the market price of the company s common stock after july  exceeds the common stock price on july   of 
the company has repriced options during fiscal and in january  which are subject to the interpretation 
at december   there were approximately  shares subject to the interpretation 
these options are accounted for as variable from july   until the options are excised  forfeited or expire unexercised 
prior to the adoption of the interpretation  the company accounted for these repriced options as fixed 
because the market price of the company s common stock was lower on december  than on july   the adoption of the interpretation had no effect upon the company s net income for year ended december   however  the company may incur significant volatility in reporting earnings in future periods as fluctuations in market prices of its common stock may greatly impact non cash expenses on a periodic basis

the company uses live beef cattle futures contracts in an attempt to accomplish its objective 
realized and unrealized changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs 
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these derivative instruments have not been significant 
as of december   the company had no positions in futures contracts 
risk factors if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors we will not be able to increase revenues or generate profits 
our inability to increase revenues is directly related to our ability to compete effectively with our competitors 
key competitive factors include o the quality and numbers of employees needed to adequately staff our restaurants  o the quality and value of the food products offered  o the quality of service  o the price of the food products offered  o the restaurant locations  and o the ambiance of facilities 
we compete with other steakhouse restaurants specifically and with all other restaurants generally 
we compete with national and regional chains  as well as individually owned restaurants 
the restaurant industry has few non economic barriers to entry  and as our competitors expand operations  competition from steakhouse restaurants with concepts similar to ours can be expected to intensify 
many of our competitors are well established in the upscale and mid scale steak segments and certain competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
such increased competition could adversely affect our revenues 
changing consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns and other factors affecting the availability of beef could force us to modify our restaurant s concept and menu and could result in a reduction in our revenues 
even if we are able to successfully compete with other restaurant companies with similar concepts  we may be forced to make changes in one or more of our concepts in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dining patterns 
consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef  the primary item on our menus  or by specific events such as the outbreak of mad cow disease or foot mouth disease which occurred in the untied kingdom 
in addition  these events could reduce the available supply of beef or significantly raise the price of beef 
if we change a restaurant concept  we may lose additional customers who do not prefer the new concept and menu  and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors 
our success also depends on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could reduce revenues and operating income 
unforeseen cost increases could adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor and other operating costs 
our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh food supplies means that shortages or interruptions in supply could materially and adversely affect our operations 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning the following factors could adversely affect our results o inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs  and o rent increases resulting from rent escalation provisions in our leases 
we may be unable to anticipate or react to changing prices 
if we are unable to modify our purchasing practices or quickly or readily pass on increased costs to customers  our business could be materially affected 
failure to comply with government regulations could adversely affect our operating performance 
our restaurant operations are subject to certain federal  state and local laws and government regulations  such as o the obtaining of licenses for the sale of food and alcohol beverages  o national and local health sanitation laws and regulations  o national and local employment and safety laws and regulations  and o local zoning  building code and land use regulations 
while we have never experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining necessary governmental approvals  the failure to obtain or retain food and liquor licenses or any other governmental approvals could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be subjected to dram shop liability  which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person with the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person 
although we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance  if we lost a lawsuit related to this liability  our business could be materially harmed 
the restaurant industry is affected by a number of trends  as well as by competition 
the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
in addition  factors such as inflation  increased food  labor and employee benefit costs and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the restaurant industry in general and our restaurants in particular 
our business depends on a limited number of key personnel  the loss of whom could adversely affect us 
some of our senior executives are important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting the strategical direction of our company  operating our business  identifying areas for expansion and arranging necessary financing 
these key personnel include jamie b 
coulter  our chairman and chief executive officer  and certain of our other executive officers 
although we feel that there is a significant pool of talented personnel in the restaurant industry  if these members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  it could adversely affect our business and development 
shareholders may not be able to resell their stock or may have to sell at a price substantially lower than the price they paid for it 
the trading price for our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results  general conditions in the restaurant industry or the general economy  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for public companies generally  or within broad industry groups  which fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating results or other circumstances of a particular company 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock  as well as price that holders may achieve for their shares upon any future sale 
staggered board  blank check preferred stock  poison pill  change of control agreements 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for three classes of directors  to be elected on a staggered basis 
this enables existing management to exercise significant control over our affairs  and may act as an impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our board of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the exercise of this authority may act as a further impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our board of directors 
furthermore  our certificate of incorporation authorizes  and we have adopted in  a preferred share purchase rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
the terms of the rights and the circumstances under which they may be exercised are contained in a rights agreement  which has been filed with the sec 
these terms have been designed to deter hostile takeovers of us  even though our stockholders might favor a takeover  especially if it were to afford them an opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market rate 
finally  our executive officers and certain employees are entitled to receive severance payments under certain circumstances if there has been a change of control of the company 
the terms and the circumstances under which the executive officers will receive the severance payments are contained in change of control agreements which have been filed as exhibits to this form k
