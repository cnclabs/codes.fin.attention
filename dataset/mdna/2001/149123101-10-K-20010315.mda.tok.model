item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
information required by item is incorporated by reference from management s discussion and analysis on pages a through a of the appendix 
safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in our management s discussion and analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results 
the words believes  expects  estimates  anticipates  will be and similar words or expressions identify forward looking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 
uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses  as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 
world economic factors our current outlook calls for a significant slowdown in growth in the us economy in early  but growth is expected to pick up momentum in the second half of the year through should recent interest rate reductions fail to stimulate the us economy as expected  leading to a more protracted slowdown or recession in  then sales of machines and engines would decline sharply this year and could be negatively impacted in as well 
the outlook also projects that economic growth is expected to continue in asia pacific  europe  africa middle east and latin america 
if  for any reason  these projected growth rates falter  sales would likely be lower than anticipated in the affected region 
in general  renewed currency speculation  significant declines in the stock markets  further oil or energy price increases  political disruptions or much higher interest rates could result in weaker than anticipated economic growth and worldwide sales of both machines and engines could be lower than expected as a result 
economic recovery could also be delayed or weakened by growing budget or current account deficits or inappropriate government policies 
in particular  our outlook assumes that the japanese government remains committed to stimulating their economy with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies and that the brazilian government follows through with promised fiscal and structural reforms 
a reversal by either government could result in economic uncertainty and a weaker economy 
our outlook also assumes that currency and stock markets remain relatively stable and that world oil prices move down  on average  from the relatively elevated levels in the fourth quarter of if currency markets were to experience a significant increase in volatility  and or stock markets were to decline significantly  interest rates could move higher  which would probably result in slower economic growth and lower sales 
in addition  an eruption of political violence in the middle east could lead to oil supply disruptions and resumed upward pressure on oil prices 
in this case  inflation pressures would move up again and interest rates would be higher than currently projected  leading to slower world economic growth and potentially to lower company sales 
the russian economy has improved  but political and economic uncertainty remains high and an unexpected deterioration could impact worldwide stock or currency markets  which in turn could weaken company sales 
commodity prices the outlook for our sales also depends on commodity prices 
consistent with our outlook for moderate worldwide economic growth in  although copper and aluminum prices are expected to be higher  industrial metals prices as a whole are expected to be about flat on average in oil prices are expected to decline from an average of about to a barrel in to an average of to a barrel in agricultural prices are likely to be flat 
based on this forecast  equipment sales into sectors that are sensitive to crude oil prices are expected to be up in industry sales to the industrial metals and agriculture equipment markets are expected to be about flat in weaker than anticipated world economic growth could lead to sharp declines in commodity prices and lower than expected sales into industrial metals  oil and agriculture 
monetary and fiscal policies for most companies operating in a global economy  monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the us and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth  and  accordingly  demand for a product 
in the united states  the federal reserve is expected to reduce the federal funds rate from current levels of to a range of to in the second half of if the federal reserve does not lower rates accordingly  and add sufficient liquidity to the banking system to generate the projected acceleration in growth in the second half of  then machine and engine industry demand could be lower than expected  potentially resulting in lower company sales 
similarly  if the european central bank raises rates in  then machine and engine demand in europe could be lower than expected 
in general  high interest rates  reductions in government spending  higher taxes  significant currency devaluations  and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand 
the current outlook is for slower us growth in  but not a recession 
if  for whatever reason  the us were to enter a recession  then demand for company products could fall in the us and canada and would also be lower throughout the rest of the world 
political factors political factors in the us and abroad have a major impact on global companies 
the company is one of the largest us exporters as a percentage of sales 
international trade and fiscal policies implemented in the us this year could impact the company s ability to expand its business abroad 
us foreign relations with certain countries and any related restrictions imposed could also have a significant impact on foreign sales 
there are a number of significant expected political developments in latin america  asia  and europe  africa and the middle east which are expected to take place in that could affect us trade policies and or de stabilize local market conditions leading to lower company sales 
currency fluctuations currency fluctuations are also an unknown for global companies 
the company has facilities in major sales areas throughout the world and significant costs and revenues in most major currencies 
this diversification greatly reduces the overall impact of currency movements on results 
however  if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the conversion of net non us dollar proceeds to non us dollars would somewhat adversely impact the company s results 
further  since the company s largest manufacturing presence is in the us  a sustained overvalued dollar could have an unfavorable impact on our global competitiveness 
dealer practices a majority of the company s sales are made through its independent dealer distribution network 
dealer practices  such as changes in inventory levels for both new and rental equipment  are not within the company s control primarily because these practices depend upon the dealer s assessment of anticipated sales and the appropriate level of inventory and may have a significant positive or negative impact on our results 
in particular  the outlook assumes that inventory to sales ratios will be somewhat lower at the end of than at the end of if dealers reduce inventory levels more than anticipated  company sales will be adversely impacted 
other factors the rate of infrastructure spending  housing starts  commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the company s results 
our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the us or abroad  demand for our products may be significantly impacted 
in  the six year federal highway bill did not boost us sales as much as anticipated due to delays in getting major capital projects for highways underway 
in  there was a material increase in the volume of highway construction contracts  which had a positive impact on sales of certain types of equipment 
if funding for highway construction in is delayed  or is concentrated on bridge repair  sales could be negatively impacted 
projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors could include  among other things  higher than expected wages  energy and or materials costs  and or higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in central bank interest rate policies 
cost savings could also be negatively impacted by unforeseen changes in tax  trade  environmental  labor  safety  payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions where the alliances conduct their operations 
results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix 
our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company s share of industry sales 
a reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  a failure to price the product competitively  or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets 
the environment also remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint 
additional price discounting would result in lower than anticipated price realization 
this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook 
obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the company s actual results to differ from those currently anticipated
