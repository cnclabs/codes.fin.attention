the company expects to maintain and support the legacy products as long as there is adequate economic and strategic justification 
the company will continue to encourage customers utilizing legacy products to migrate to newer products 
since the company s exit from the hardware sector in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended march   the company has continued to receive commissions from hardware vendors for product referrals although this is not a material source of revenue for the company 
the software products offered by the company range in price from to  on a per license basis  but the total contract value for certain multiple site global brokers is over  in the fiscal year ended december  fiscal and in the nine month transition period ended december  transition period  one domestic customer including its foreign subsidiary  a new york stock exchange listed multi national insurance company  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated revenue

one is operational on pervasive database software 
product development at december   the company employed full time employees and offshore contract engineers engaged in product development activities 
these activities include research and development of software enhancements such as adding functionality  improving usefulness  increasing responsiveness  adapting to newer software and hardware technologies and developing and maintaining the website 
product development expenditures were   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and transition period  respectively 
competition management believes its principal competition is represented by four companies  two of which provide client server based software systems that are comparable to those offered by the company and two of which provide websites devoted to insurance sales 
these companies are larger than the company and may have greater financial resources 
the company is not aware of any other companies that offer software that specifically addresses the independent agency marketplace 
however  certain large hardware suppliers do sell systems and systems components to independent agencies 
the company  to a much lesser extent  also experiences competition from small  independent or freelance developers and suppliers of software who sometimes work in concert with hardware companies to supply systems to independent agencies 
the company believes that most insurance carriers are in the process of reducing or eliminating their in house agency and brokerage efforts 
nevertheless  some insurance carriers continue to operate subsidiaries which actively compete with the company 
these carriers have much greater financial resources than the company and have in the past subsidized the automation of independent agencies through various incentives offered to promote the sale of the carriers insurance products 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that insurance carriers will continue to withdraw from competition with the company 
key competitive factors in the company s software and services market are product technology  features and functions  ease of use  price  reputation  reliability  effects of insurance regulation  and quality of customer support and training 
management believes that overall  the company competes favorably with respect to these factors 
key features of the company s new ebix 
com website products that the company believes will be of competitive significance include the i ability to complete end to end conversion of data from input to policy issuance  ii offering of both personal and commercial lines  iii provision of a new market to insurance brokers  insurance carriers and agents for expansion of their business  iv affording to insurance customers a marketplace in which insurance can be priced on an objective competitive basis  and v ability to complete transactions online 
management believes that overall  the company competes favorably with respect to these factors 
proprietary rights the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it with copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure and transferring title 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of the company s products or  without authorization  to obtain and use information which the company regards as trade secrets 
existing copyright law affords only limited practical protection and the company s software is unpatented 
deferred revenue the company traditionally invoices software maintenance and support on a quarterly or annual basis in advance of providing the service 
the software maintenance fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the respective software maintenance agreements 
employees at december   the company had employees  including employees in sales and marketing  employees in product development  employees in customer service and operations  and employees in general management  administration and finance

mall and ebix

although transactions occurred on the website for ebix 
mall in and  and the company began to generate revenue on ebix 
mall in  the amount of revenue recognized to date has been immaterial 
transactions have not occurred on the website for ebix 
link 
ebix 
mall generates revenues through transaction fees and acceptance fees currently  charges payable by an agent  broker or carrier  as the case may be  are upon quoting  and upon processing a sale of a policy through the company s site 
ebix 
link is expected to generate revenues through transaction fees 
in january  the company began marketing the ebixasp product 
ebixasp is a web enabled system for agencies to manage their business 
this product is expected to generate revenues through initial registration and ongoing monthly subscription fees based on the number of personnel accessing the software on a concurrent basis 
because the company does not have the substantial capital necessary at this time to adequately promote the website  the company cannot predict whether  when or how the website will generate substantial revenues 
the company s agreement with brit insurance holdings plc is intended to address these concerns 
see recent developments  below  in this item the company continues to provide the agency management software product line which is comprised of ebix

the legacy products provide basic functions such as policy administration  claims handling  accounting  and financial reporting 
the company expects to maintain and support the legacy products as long as there is adequate economic and strategic justification 
the company will continue to encourage customers utilizing legacy products to migrate to newer products 
the insurance industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past several years driven by the need for  and benefits from  economies of scale and scope in providing low cost insurance 
consolidation has involved both insurance brokerages  the company s primary customers  and insurance companies  and is directly impacting the manner in which insurance products are distributed 
management believes the insurance industry will continue to experience significant changes in the next several years to meet the changing distribution model 
changes in the insurance industry may create opportunities and challenges for the company 
management believes consolidation will force brokerages to decrease distribution costs and eliminate labor intensive tasks via automation 
competition will force brokerages to increase service levels via improved automated processes such as quoting and claims processing 
management believes that the company can partner with customers to provide integrated information management solutions  and fully leverage information technology and services 
management expects the consolidation of the insurance industry to create a marketplace of fewer yet more sophisticated brokers and agents 
in such an environment  the company could be subject to heightened effects of competition  particularly with respect to product functionality  service and price
