at december   our portal sites in bakersfield  california and rochester  new york were operational 
as with many media companies  our acquisitions and dispositions have resulted in significant non cash and non recurring charges to income 
for this reason  in addition to net income  our management believes that ebitda defined as net revenue less operating expenses and restructuring expenses before amortization  depreciation  interest  net gain on dispositions of assets  stock compensation expense  and equity in losses of affiliates is an appropriate measure of our financial performance 
similarly  we believe that segment operating cash flow defined as ebitda before corporate overhead is an appropriate measure of our segments financial performance 
these measures exclude certain expenses that management does not consider to be costs of ongoing operations 
we use ebitda to pay interest and principal on our long term debt as well as to finance capital expenditures 
ebitda and segment operating cash flow  however  are not to be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity

following are items that may impact our liquidity in our television broadcasting segment typically enjoys significant revenues from political advertising in even numbered years 
in  we received over million of revenue from political advertising that may not be replaced by other advertising categories in our liquidity may be impacted negatively to the extent such political revenue is not replaced by other advertising categories in national advertising may decrease as a result of the slowing national economy 
our liquidity may be impacted negatively depending on the magnitude of this trend  its duration  and our ability to offset decreased national sales with increased local sales 
we enjoyed a significant increase in revenues from the dot com advertising category in  primarily in our outdoor media segment 
however  thus far in we are seeing a decline in revenue from this sector compared to levels 
if this trend continues throughout  our liquidity may be impacted negatively to the extent we are unable to offset such a decline by increasing revenue from other advertising categories

this transaction is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements

in particular  our net revenue and ebitda historically have been affected positively by increased advertising activity in the second and fourth quarters 
taxes due to the gain on the sale of our florida outdoor advertising operations  our federal net operating loss  alternative minimum tax credit  and charitable contribution carryforwards will be fully utilized in our federal tax return
