this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties

factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those set forth in item i under the caption factors affecting future operating results and information regarding forward looking statements as well as those discussed elsewhere in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  all references to razorfish refer to razorfish  and subsequent to their acquisition or formation  its subsidiaries 
overview razorfish derives substantially all of its revenues from fees for services generated on a project by project basis 
razorfish s services are provided on both a fixed time  fixed price basis and on a time and materials basis 
historically  razorfish has not operated on a retainer basis  however  in the future  razorfish may utilize such arrangements 
razorfish recognizes revenues for both time and materials based arrangements and fixed time  fixed price arrangements on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
in developing the fixed price of a project  razorfish follows a process that assesses the technical complexity of the project  the nature of the work  the functions to be performed and the resources required to complete the engagement 
razorfish periodically reassesses its estimated costs for each project  and provisions for estimated losses on unfinished projects are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
revenues exclude reimbursable expenses charged to clients 
agreements entered into in connection with time and materials projects are generally terminable by the client upon days prior written notice  and clients are required to pay razorfish for all time  materials and expenses incurred by razorfish through the effective date of termination 
agreements entered into in connection with fixed time  fixed price projects  are generally terminable by the client upon payment for work performed and the next progress payment due 
if clients terminate existing agreements or if razorfish is unable to enter into new engagements  razorfish s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  because a proportion of razorfish s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number of client engagements can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
razorfish s projects vary in size and scope  therefore  a client that accounts for a significant portion of razorfish s revenues in one period may not generate a similar amount of revenue in subsequent periods 
no client accounted for more than of razorfish s revenues in  or razorfish does not believe that it will derive a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of clients in the near future 
however  there is a risk that the source of razorfish s revenues may be generated from a small number of clients 
these clients may not retain razorfish in the future 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in work performed for these principal clients or a significant number of smaller clients could have a material adverse affect on razorfish s business  financial condition and results of operations

project personnel costs also include fees paid to subcontractors for work performed in connection with projects and non reimbursed project travel expenses 
razorfish s selling and marketing costs consist primarily of compensation and related costs of sales and marketing personnel  travel expenses  and marketing programs and promotion costs

year ended december  in thousands except per share data pro forma revenues   net income loss   basic net loss per share diluted net loss per share seasonality in general  the laws of the european countries in which razorfish operates mandate that all employees receive significantly more vacation days than in the united states 
for example  in sweden  each employee must receive a minimum of days of paid vacation per year 
these vacations are typically taken in the third quarter  resulting in declining revenues during this period due to a reduction in both billable hours and client demand 
quarter to quarter fluctuations in margins razorfish s operating results and quarter to quarter margins may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  some of which are beyond razorfish s control 
historically  razorfish s quarterly margins have been impacted by o the number of client engagements undertaken or completed  o a change in the scope of ongoing client engagements  o seasonality  o a shift from fixed fee to time and materials based contracts  o the number of days during the quarter  o utilization rates of employees  o marketing and business development expenses  o charges relating to strategic acquisitions  o pricing changes in the information technology services market  and o economic conditions generally or in the information technology services market
