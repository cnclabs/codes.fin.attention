item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our primary business is the manufacture and marketing of plastic films for use in the packaging  transportation  beverage  food  automotive  pharmaceutical  chemical  electronics  construction  agricultural and textile industries 
we currently have manufacturing operations located in countries in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
we manufacture plastic films principally from resins blended with other raw materials 
we may either sell the film or further process it by metallizing  printing  laminating  slitting or converting it 
our processing technologies enable us to create a variety of value added products according to the specifications of our customers 
resin costs generally constitute approximately of the cost of goods sold 
since resin costs typically fluctuate  selling prices are generally determined as a spread over resin costs  usually expressed as cents per pound 
accordingly  costs and profits are most often expressed in cents per pound  and  with certain exceptions  the historical increases and decreases in resin costs have generally been reflected over a period of time in the sales prices of the products on a penny for penny basis 
assuming a constant volume of sales  an increase in resin costs should therefore result in increased sales revenues but lower gross profit as a percentage of sales or gross profit margin  while a decrease in resin costs should result in lower sales revenues with higher gross profit margins

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through cash flow generated from operations and borrowings by us or our subsidiaries under various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund working capital  including operating expenses  debt service  and capital expenditures 
our working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october  this decrease of million in working capital is primarily the result of the strengthening of the united states dollar during fiscal which reduced translated working capital balances of foreign subsidiaries 
the remaining increases and decreases in components of our financial position reflect normal operating activity

the credit agreement provided us with two credit facilities  consisting of a term credit facility in the amount of million and a revolving credit facility currently for an amount up to million 
as of october   there was million outstanding under the term credit facility 
at october   there was a standby letter of credit in the amount of million held as security against the pennsylvania industrial loan due on february   thereby reducing the revolving credit facility availablity to million 
there are no other outstanding borrowings under this facility 
on april   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement the amendment 
the principal effects of the amendment relate to certain changes in the financial ratios contained in the credit agreement  the change of the interest rate applicable to the credit agreement and the granting of security interests in our accounts receivables and inventory located in north america and in of our equity interest in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the interest rate margins which determine the interest rates applicable to the loans under the credit agreement increased as follows the margin applicable to base rate loans formerly to 
increased to a range from 
to and the margin applicable to libor rate loans formerly 
to increased to a range from to 
the credit agreement  as amended  contains financial covenants  the most significant of which are a cash flow ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
for the period from august   through october   the cash flow ratio may not exceed the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than for the same period 
the indenture pursuant to which the senior subordinated notes were issued also contains customary covenants including limitations on the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets and the making of restricted payments 
we are currently in compliance with all of these covenants  and we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants 
we maintain various unsecured short term credit facilities at our foreign subsidiaries 
at october   the aggregate amount outstanding under such facilities was approximately  and approximately million was available for borrowing 
borrowings from these facilities are used to support operations at such subsidiaries and are generally serviced by cash flow from operations 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at october   as compared to million at the same date in the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense of million  final disposition of net assets held for sale of million and reduction of trade accounts receivable by million  offset by net loss from continuing operations of million  net investment in inventories of million  and net increases in other operating assets and liabilities of million 
in each period  the net decreases in other operating assets and liabilities reflect normal operating activity

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  reflecting net repayments of million of available credit facilities and proceeds from stock issuances of million 
the remaining increases and decreases in the components of our financial position reflect normal operating activity 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  combined with the availability of funds under the credit agreement and credit lines available to our foreign subsidiaries for local currency borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
although the company anticipates that internal sources will generate sufficient funds to pay the final principal installment of approximately million due on october   under the credit agreement  if it is unable to do so  it will be required to refinance the obligation  and there can be no assurances that the company could do so on favorable terms 
effects of inflation inflation is not expected to have significant impact on our business
