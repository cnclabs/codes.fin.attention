as a result  the company s future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of these products 
the united states has been experiencing a general decline in economic conditions 
the downturn in general economic conditions has led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services  including many technology products 
if conditions continue to worsen  or fail to improve  we could see a significant decrease in the overall demand for our products and services that could harm our operating results 
since inception  the company has invested significant resources in developing its software and related solutions  as well as building its sales  services  marketing  and general administrative organizations 
as a result  since inception the company s operating expenses have increased in absolute dollar amounts and are expected to continue to increase

the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element of the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element

during  the company has recognized revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the company adopted the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which explains how the sec staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied or analogized to for transactions not addressed by existing rules 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
prior to  the company recognized revenue in accordance with sop  in conjunction with sop license revenue increased by to million in  decreased by to million in  and increased by to million in  representing   and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the growth in license revenue in  in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  was due to an increase in the number of licenses sold as the company rebounded from an overall softness in the market in in addition  the company made a significant investment in the size of its sales organization in  resulting in a continued penetration of sales to new as well as existing customers 
this increase reflected customer acceptance of documentum i  which was released in the second half of and expanded the company s product offerings into web content management 
in  license revenue was adversely impacted by a general industry slowdown in customer license sales for enterprise software applications 
in addition  the company experienced a weakness in customer demand and difficulty in closing large license contracts with customers in the first half of the growth in license revenue in was due to an increase in the number of licenses sold  reflecting increased acceptance of the company s edms family of products  as well as an increase in the number of customers who purchased additional product licenses  and the expansion of the company s sales organization 
the decreases in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue in both and were due to increased service revenue  as discussed below  as well as an overall decrease in license revenue due to the industry slowdown 
for the years ended december  and license revenue from xerox and certain xerox affiliates  as systems integrators  accounted for and of total license revenue  respectively 
the loss of a major customer or any reduction or delay in orders by such customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
also  the company s strategy to provide customers with whole solutions could result in software licenses being bundled with services 
therefore  with certain future transactions  the delivery of services may delay recognition of license revenue 
service revenue increased by to million in  by to million in  and by to million in  representing   and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the increase in absolute dollars was attributable to a larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance  training and support services and increases in the company s professional services staff in conjunction with the company s focus to expand solution offerings to customers 
the decrease in service revenue as a percentage of total revenue in was primarily due to an overall increase in license revenue as the company rebounded from an overall market softness in  as discussed above 
the increase in service revenue as a percent of total revenue in was mainly due to a decrease in total license revenue as discussed above 
the company markets its products through its direct sales force and its indirect channel partners 
while historically the company has generated the majority of its revenue from its direct sales force  the company has also focused on complementing its direct sales channel with indirect channels  consisting of systems integrators  distributors  and application service providers 
revenue from all indirect channel partners comprised   and of license revenue in   and  respectively 
revenue from indirect partners for any period is subject to significant variations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of indirect revenue are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
international revenue represented   and of license revenue in   and  respectively 
the decrease in international revenue as a percent of license revenue in was primarily due to an overall rise in domestic license revenue as compared to the general industry slowdown in negatively impacted domestic revenue to a greater extent than international revenue  however  the company rebounded from that slowdown in in addition  in the company had an enterprise wide sale to a single global customer in the amount of million in europe  which increased international revenue as a percentage of overall worldwide sales 
the company classifies license revenue as domestic or international based upon the billing location of the customer 
in many instances  especially with large purchases from multinational companies  the customer has the right to deploy the licenses anywhere in the world 
thus  the percentages discussed herein represent where licenses were sold  and may or may not represent where the products are used 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of international revenue are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
cost of revenue cost of license revenue consists primarily of the royalties paid to third party vendors  packaging  documentation  production and freight costs 
royalties  which are paid to third parties for selected products  include both fixed fees and variable fees 
cost of license revenue increased by to million in  by to million in  and by to million in  representing   and of the related license revenue in   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in cost of license revenue as a percentage of overall license revenue over the three year period was related to a continued shift in the mix of products being sold 
although the company sold more royalty bearing products in than those sold in  the sales of these products did not grow proportionately to license revenue thus resulting in a decline as a percentage of overall license revenue 
the company currently carries more third party products and is selling a greater number of those products than it had in prior years 
thus  royalty expenses associated with the increase in sales of third party products have increased over the three year period 
the company expects the cost of license revenue to fluctuate in absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of overall license revenue as the related license revenue fluctuates 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs incurred in providing consulting services  training to customers  and maintenance services  which includes telephone support 
cost of services revenue increased by to million in  by to million in  and by to million in  representing   and of the related service revenue in   and  respectively 
the increase in the cost of service revenue in absolute dollar amount was a result of increased personnel related costs as the company expanded its consulting  training  and maintenance operations to support a larger installed customer base  as well as an increase in solutions offered to customers 
the decrease in cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue in and was primarily due to economies of scale realized as certain expenses such as consulting costs grew proportionately less than consulting revenue

the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue in was primarily due to the company s decision to invest in research and development at a slower rate and invest more heavily in sales and marketing 
based on the company s research and development process  costs incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility and general release have been insignificant and therefore have been expensed as incurred 
the company expects research and development costs will continue to increase in absolute dollar amount in order to support continued development efforts to both existing and new products
