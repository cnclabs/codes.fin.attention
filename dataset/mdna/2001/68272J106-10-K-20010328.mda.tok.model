overview onesource provides web based business and financial information to professionals who need quick access to reliable corporate  industry and market intelligence 
onesource was formed as a division of lotus development corporation in and became an independent company when it was purchased in a management buy out in until december  our business was to provide business information to the financial community using cd rom technology as the primary method of distribution 
the introduction of business browser in december marked a fundamental shift in our business as we began a transition away from our legacy cd rom business and toward web based products 
onesource s business browser product line is designed to be a comprehensive and easy to use business and financial information resource  integrating over  sources of business information from more than category leading business and financial information providers 
business browser accounted for of the company s revenue for the year ended december  on october   onesource acquired corporate technology  a delaware corporation located in woburn  massachusetts 
corporate technology is a provider of high technology company profiles with a focus on emerging private companies 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  the consideration paid by onesource was million in cash 
a portion of the cash consideration is being held in escrow to be released in accordance with the agreement and plan of merger and an escrow agreement 
for financial statement purposes  this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of corporate technology subsequent to october  have been included in onesource s consolidated statements of operations 
in may  we sold our cd insurance division to allow us to focus more completely on our new web based product line 
we recognized a gain of million on this sale during in addition  in connection with the disposition  we licensed certain of our cd rom software to the acquiror in exchange for million of license fees 
these license fees were paid in eight equal quarterly installments beginning january  and ending on december  and were recognized ratably as other income 
for each of the years ended december  and december   onesource recorded million of other income related to the software license agreement 
our revenues for both cd rom and web based products consist of monthly subscription fees from customer contracts 
customer contracts span varying periods of time but are generally for one year  are renewable for like periods  and are payable in advance 
subscription fees generally are quoted to clients on an annual basis but are earned as revenues on a monthly basis over the subscription period 
invoices are recorded as accounts receivable until paid and as deferred revenues until earned 
deferred revenues attributable to web based products increased to million as of december  from million as of december  and increased from million as of december  cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties to information providers and  to a lesser extent  employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses  depreciation associated with computers for data processing and on line requirements and web hosting expenses 
we enter into contracts with our information providers which are generally for a term of at least one year and are automatically renewable if not canceled with advance notice 
these contracts may be terminated under certain circumstances 
under these arrangements  royalties are generally paid on a quarterly basis to information providers 
royalties are generally calculated either as a flat percentage of our revenues  as a per user fee that declines as the number of authorized users of the product increases  as a fixed fee per period  or in some cases  we pay a calculated fee based upon product growth compared to like periods from the prior year 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits and sales commissions paid to our sales force  customer support organization and marketing personnel  as well as facilities allocation and related expenses  direct marketing promotional materials  trade show exhibitions and advertising 
sales commissions are paid when customers are invoiced and are recorded as deferred subscription costs  which are amortized ratably over the term of the contract  typically months  as the associated revenues are recognized 
all other selling and marketing costs are expensed as incurred 
platform and product development expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits  facilities allocation and related expenses  as well as outside contractor expenses  relating to the development of our platform of core software supporting our products and the development of new products based upon that platform 
platform and product development expense includes expenses relating to the editorial staff that implements our keyid technology to integrate disparate information sources into our web based products

this is a measurement we use for normalized period to period comparisons to indicate business volume and growth  both in terms of new customers and upgrades and expansions at existing customers 
our presentation and calculation of annualized contract value may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
it is not an absolute indicator and we cannot guarantee that any annualized contract value will be ultimately realized as revenues 
we use annualized contract value as a measure of our business because it shows the growth or decline in our customer base in a way that revenues cannot 
since our business is a subscription business  revenues are recognized not when a sale is made  but in ratable portions over the term of the subscription which is usually twelve months 
as a result  from a revenue viewpoint the addition or loss of even a major customer contract may not have a dramatic impact on a quarter to quarter basis 
on the other hand  by looking at the value of customer contracts in hand at the end of each quarter  we can more readily see trends in our business 
for example  the addition of a one year subscription contract with total payments of million may only increase revenues by approximately  million divided by four in the quarter in which the sale is made  but would increase annualized contract value by million 
similarly  if the customer did not renew that contract  revenues in the next quarter would only decrease by  while annualized contract value would decrease by million 
in calculating annualized contract value  we include only those contracts where the customer has actually been invoiced 
since amounts invoiced are included in deferred revenues on our balance sheet for all customer contracts with terms extending beyond the month of invoice  this demonstrates that annualized contract value is based on actual customer contracts reflected in our historical financial statements 
to compute annualized contract value  we multiply by twelve the total amount of fees invoiced for one month and included in deferred revenues 
annualized contract value is not intended to be an absolute indicator of future revenues 
we only annualize existing  invoiced contracts  but we do so without regard to the remaining term of those contracts 
most of our contracts are for months  but as of the date that we calculate annualized contract value the remaining term of nearly all of our contracts will be less than months 
if a customer fails to pay its invoiced fees or terminates the contract or if we are unable to renew a contract  our revenues in subsequent periods may be less than expected based solely on annualized contract values 
conversely  if we add additional customers or renew existing contracts at higher rates  our revenues in future periods may exceed expectations based solely on annualized contract value 
the calculation of annualized contract value for our web based products is illustrated below one month of web based invoiced fees deferred in deferred annualized measurement date revenues revenues contract value in thousands december     december     we have increased annualized contract value attributable to web based products to million as of december  from million as of december  the number of web based customers has increased to at december  from at december  at the same time  the average annualized contract value of all web based product customers has increased to  per customer at december  from  per customer at december  this growth was attributable to an increase in the number of user seats purchased by customers and the addition of new products 
liquidity and capital resources since acquiring our business from lotus development corporation in  we have funded our operations through a combination of seller financing  proceeds received from the sale of class p common stock and common stock in connection with the purchase of the business from lotus development corporation  bank debt  proceeds received from the sale of non strategic lines of business  capitalized equipment leases  cash flows from operations and our initial public offering which closed in may our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to funds provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the net change of million period to period is the result of a net income of million compared to a net loss of million and increased depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was primarily from purchases of property and equipment for million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   as well as the acquisition of corporate technology for million during net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our various stock option and stock purchase plans  offset in part by repayments of capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  offset in part by the repurchase and retirement of common stock and repayments of debt and capital lease obligations 
we do not currently have a line of credit but intend to enter into a revolving line of credit for letters of credit and general working capital 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with our current cash and cash equivalents and funds anticipated to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months

certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
onesource s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including without limitation  those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating onesource and its business 
we have a limited operating history with business browser and the products acquired from corporate technology on which to evaluate our prospects 
we began operations as an independent company in we began to migrate our business to the web from cd rom based products in early  and launched the web based business browser product line in december in  we acquired several products  primarily consisting of cd rom  printed directories and mailing lists from corporate technology 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies transitioning to a new product line  particularly companies in the new and rapidly evolving market for internet and web based business information products 
we have a cumulative deficit and expect to continue to have a cumulative deficit for the foreseeable future 
we incurred losses from operations of approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and million in in addition  we have not reached the critical mass of users of web based products  that we believe is necessary to effectively leverage our royalty payments and infrastructure expenses  which may not allow onesource to sustain and increase profits 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we rely on our business browser product line  and we will not succeed unless demand for our business browser products continues to grow 
subscription revenues from our business browser product line accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in at the end of we phased out our legacy cd rom products that are not part of the business browser product line 
as a result  our future financial condition will depend heavily on the success or failure of our business browser product line 
business browser products were introduced in december and it is difficult to predict demand and market acceptance for these products in the new and rapidly evolving web based business information services market 
if the demand for business browser products does not continue to grow  whether due to competition  lack of market acceptance  failure of internet or web use to grow in general  technological change or other factors  our business would suffer significantly 
annualized contract value may not be an accurate indication of our performance 
we use annualized contract value as a measurement for normalized period to period comparisons to indicate business volume and growth 
our presentation and calculation of annualized contract value may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
it is not an absolute indicator and we cannot guarantee that any annualized contract value will be ultimately realized as revenues 
competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do  this competition may adversely affect our financial results 
the business information services industry is intensely competitive 
we face direct or indirect competition from the following types of companies large  well established business and financial information providers such as dow jones  lexis nexis  pearson  reuters  factiva  thomson  primark and mcgraw hill on line information services or websites targeted to specific markets or applications  such as newsedge  factset and bloomberg providers of sales  marketing and credit information such as dun bradstreet  infousa  siebel web retrieval  web portal companies and other free or low cost mass market on line services such as excite  infoseek  terra lycos  yahoo and aol time warner free or low cost specialized business and financial information websites such as hoovers 
com  marketwatch 
com  multex 
com and thestreet 
com based on reported operating results  industry reports and other publicly available information  we believe that many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of prospective competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in user requirements  or to devote greater resources to the research  development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees  customers and information providers 
our competitors also may develop products that are equal or superior to our products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
expansion into international markets in which we have limited prior experience could cause material and adverse effects on our business 
we presently have offices in the united kingdom  but look to expand our business opportunities into new markets  particularly throughout europe 
expanding into diverse international markets exposes us to certain risks of conducting business that include but are not limited to the following potential higher costs  unanticipated regulatory changes  political instability  difficulties in staffing and managing operations  adverse tax consequences  currency and exchange rate fluctuations  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
in addition  the impact of language and other cultural differences could result in product and service offerings that might not satisfy the needs of our customers and might not be profitable 
further  strategic relationships might be necessary to facilitate expansion into certain markets  and our business might be adversely affected if we misallocate our resources and ultimately fail to gain new or effective alliances in this area 
if our information providers stopped doing business with us  we could not continue to sell business browser 
we do not own or create all of the original content distributed through our products 
we depend significantly on information providers to supply information and data feeds to us on a timely basis 
our products could experience interruptions due to any failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information 
if our software is defective  it might be costly to correct  we could get sued and our reputation could be harmed 
complex software like the software we develop for our products may contain errors or defects  especially when first implemented  that may be very costly to correct 
defects or errors also could result in downtime and our business could suffer significantly from potential adverse customer reaction  negative publicity and harm to our reputation 
we may have difficulty identifying and competing for acquisition opportunities 
our business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions 
from time to time we may engage in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of niche expertise  business and proprietary rights 
in executing our acquisition strategy  we may be unable to identify suitable companies as acquisition candidates  making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
pursuing and completing potential acquisitions could divert management attention and financial resources and may not produce the desired business results 
if we pursue any acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and management and financial resources in the acquisition process and to integrate the acquired business with our existing business 
to pay for an acquisition  we may use capital stock  cash  or a combination of both 
alternatively  we may borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced 
in addition  from an accounting perspective  an acquisition may involve nonrecurring charges or involve amortization of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our results of operations 
despite the investment of these management and financial resources and completion of due diligence with respect to these efforts  an acquisition may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated  and an acquired technology or proprietary right may not perform as expected for a variety of reasons  including difficulty in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  rights  products and personnel of the acquired company risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results  which makes it difficult for investors to make reliable period to period comparisons and contributes to volatility in the market price for our common stock 
our quarterly revenues  gross profits and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
in addition  we believe that an important measure of our business is the annualized contract value at the end of each period  which also may fluctuate 
causes of such fluctuations have included and may include  among other factors changes in demand for our products the dollar value and timing of both new and renewal subscriptions competition particularly price competition increases in selling and marketing expenses  as well as other operating expenses technical difficulties or system downtime affecting our products or the web generally economic conditions specific to the web  as well as general economic conditions consolidation of our customers in addition  a substantial portion of our expenses  including most product development and selling and marketing expenses  must be incurred in advance of revenue generation 
if our projected revenue does not meet our expectations  then we are likely to experience an even larger shortfall in our operating profit loss relative to our expectations 
further  although we are not presently a party to a lawsuit  any potential claims  even if not meritorious  against us could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part  which could materially impact our results of operations 
if we continue to lose key personnel and are unable to attract additional and retain existing key personnel  it could cause a material and adverse effect on our business 
our future success will depend  in substantial part  on the continued services of our senior management  including daniel j 
schimmel  our president and chief executive officer  william g 
schumacher  our senior vice president  content development  philip j 
garlick  our senior vice president  global sales  dileep hurry  our senior vice president  business development  roy d 
landon  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  michael buzzell  our senior vice president  engineering  and mary f 
mccabe  our senior vice president  product development 
none of our senior management has entered into employment agreements with us  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
in the first quarter of  two members of our senior management team resigned 
we may experience difficulty in transitioning their replacements into these key management roles 
in addition  the loss of the services of one or a group of our other key personnel could have a material  adverse effect on development of new products and services  our ability to manage the business  and our financial condition 
further  our future success will also depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified technical  customer support  sales  financial  accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such key personnel is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain such personnel or that we will be able to attract  assimilate  or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
moreover  competition for highly qualified key personnel may lead to increased costs of retaining the services of such personnel  thus potentially hindering our financial condition 
any one or more of these factors could affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  and this makes the prediction of results of operations on a quarterly basis unreliable 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations and annualized contract values are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication for future performance 
also  due to these and other factors  it is possible that our quarterly results of operations including the annualized contract value may be below expectations 
if this happens  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk onesource is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
however  our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of our united kingdom subsidiary are almost exclusively conducted in local currency 
operating results are translated into united states dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the years ended december  and we do not engage in hedging activities 
onesource also owns money market funds and government securities that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve onesource s capital until it is required to fund operations  including the company s marketing and product development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
