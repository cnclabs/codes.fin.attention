it is anticipated that the initial sigma tau investment will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund its operations through the second quarter of the company is in negotiations with sigma tau and other potential investors to provide additional financing 
should the company be unable to secure additional financing during the first six months of  the company is at increasing risk of not being able to continue as a going concern and may not be able to remain financially viable

results of operations year ended december  compared to the five months ended december  the comparison data presented below is for information purposes 
it is difficult to analyze variances between the year ended december  and the five months ended december  for two reasons the comparative periods are different and the five months ended december  includes merger related restructuring charges

the company has a multi year marketing and joint venture agreement with nutramax products  inc under which the company is supplying its proprietary triple antibiotic product using the dermaflo tm technology to nutramax for conversion and sale in the form of adhesive strips and patches 
nutramax has the exclusive right to sell the finished products to the retail and industrial first aid markets

in february  nutramax s plan of reorganization was approved by the us bankruptcy court

on april   nutramax filed a motion with the us bankruptcy court to reject our supply agreement effective that date 
costs of product sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  in the five months ended december  the relative increase in cost resulted from the increase in production of the company s topical triple antibiotic rolled padded stock and higher product sales for glofil tm and inulin  in addition to a  write down to accurately reflect the current value of inventory in stock 
gross margins for the marketed products for the year ended december  were for ethamolin r  for glofil tm  for inulin  and for the rolled padded stock  compared to the   and  respectively  for the five month period ended december  the negative gross margin in rolled padded stock for the period resulted from the initial production and start up costs for that product 
the rolled padded stock is made with costly raw materials  and in addition  our sales price to nutramax is contractually fixed by our agreement with them 
the gross margins for glofil tm and inulin have been historically affected by shrinkage resulting from short shelf lives 
it is anticipated that increased sales volume will reduce that shrinkage

this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of our rolled padded stock of neoflo tm 
ethamolin r sales declines were a result of wholesale stocking during the period and competition from certain medical devices in the ethamolin r market 
with the addition and training of the sales force during the rd quarter of  the promotional support behind ethamolin r and the backorder situation resolved  the company believes the outlook for ethamolin r sales in is positive

net sales declined during the fiscal year ended july   principally due to increasing competition in the market served by ethamolin r and the expected decline in glofil tm sales volume due to the termination in the third quarter of fiscal of a customer s two clinical trials which required glofil tm to be used as part of their protocols

general and administrative expenses decreased by to  in fiscal  from  in the comparable period 
the decrease resulted from the fact that the period included legal and administrative costs associated with the dermaflo tm acquisition 
discovery research expense increased by to  in fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year  principally due to expenditures associated with the development of the dermaflo tm technology 
interest and other income decreased by to  in fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year  principally because the company had a larger investment portfolio during the prior fiscal year

at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  compared to  at december   including a compensating balance of  in each period 
at december   working capital was  compared to  at december  the decrease in working capital was principally due to the loss from operations for the current and prior years and payments for accrued restructuring costs resulting from the acquisition of ribogene  inc as a result of the merger with ribogene  the company assumed million of long term debt financing with a bank 
the note required monthly interest payments  at prime plus at december   with the principal payment due at the end of the three year term december 
the note was collateralized by a perfected security interest in all unencumbered assets of the company and required that the company maintain depository balances 
the company was also required to comply with financial covenants based on certain ratios 
at june  the company was not in compliance with at least one such financial covenant 
hence  the company reclassified the million note payable from long term to short term debt 
in november  the million note payable was converted into a million cash secured facility  the financial covenants were removed and the blanket lien on all assets were released 
the interest expense on the million note is fixed at a rate of greater than the certificate of deposit interest rate earned on the underlying million cash investment which serves as a compensating bank balance with its use restricted 
the company leases four buildings with lease terms ranging from three to fifteen years and annual rent payments for are estimated to be  additionally  the company has equipment lease commitments with estimated payments of  the company has subleased a substantial portion of the unused building space and laboratory equipment under a sublease with a term of six years  representing estimated sublease revenue of  for additionally  the company has a commitment to fund emitasol r co development costs up to million  of which million has been paid 
the company expects that its cash needs will increase significantly in future periods due to increased clinical testing activity  growth of sales  marketing  administrative and clinical development and regulatory staff 
even with the april investment by sigma tau and the exercise of the warrant  which has not and may not occur see below  the company s management believes that the company s working capital will not be sufficient to fund the operations of the company and will not be able to meet day to day operating expenses or long term commitments past the second quarter of without an additional capital infusion 
the company is  at present  in negotiations with different potential financial investors who have indicated an interest in investing in the company and have offered to contribute equity capital 
should the company be unable to secure the necessary financing  the company is at increasing risk of not being able to continue as a going concern and may not be able to remain financially viable 
the company s future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  any expansion or acceleration of the company s development programs  the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by the company or its collaborative partners or licensees  if any  the acquisition and licensing of products  technologies or compounds  if any  the company s ability to manage growth  competing technological and market developments  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims  the receipt of licensing or milestone fees from current or future collaborative and license agreements  if established  the timing of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the company is funding a portion of its operating expenses through its cash flow from product sales  but expects to seek additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funds can be obtained on desirable terms or at all 
the company may seek to raise additional capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time

acquisition of ribogene  inc development program emitasol r is the primary ribogene development program acquired in november this program was assigned a value of  which was charged to acquired in process research and development 
the company s management is primarily responsible for estimating the fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
the program has been valued based on a discounted probable future cash flow analysis using discount rates and probability of technical success factors which management believes adequately reflects the substantial risk of drug development 
in the valuation model  it is assumed that clinical trials are successfully completed  regulatory approval to market the product is obtained and the company is able to manufacture the products in commercial quantities 
future cash flows  if any  will result primarily from milestone and royalty payments from shire and other licenses of emitasol r
