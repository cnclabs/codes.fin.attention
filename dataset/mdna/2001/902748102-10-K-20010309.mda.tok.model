item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
major influences on financial condition uil holdings financial condition will continue to be dependent on the level of ui s electric utility retail sales and ui s ability to control expenses  as well as on the performance of the businesses of uil holdings non regulated subsidiaries 
the two primary factors that affect electric utility sales volume are economic conditions and weather 
the principal factors affecting the financial condition of aps and xcelecom are the pace of technological changes  competition and risks related to the management of growth  including  in the case of xcelecom  acquisition financing and integration 
uil holdings financial status and financing capability will continue to be sensitive to many other factors  including conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  interest rates  the level of income and cash flow of uil holdings subsidiaries  and legislative and regulatory developments  including the cost of compliance with increasingly stringent environmental legislation and regulations 
on december   the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc completed a financial and operational review of ui and ordered a five year incentive regulation plan for the years through the rate plan 
the rate plan accelerates the amortization and recovery of unspecified assets during if ui s common equity return on regulated utility investment exceeds after recording the amortization 
ui s authorized return on regulated utility common equity during the period is 
earnings above  on an annual basis  are utilized one third for customer price reductions  one third to increase amortization of assets  and one third retained as earnings 
the rate plan included a provision that it could be reopened and modified upon the enactment of electric utility restructuring legislation in connecticut 
on october   the dpuc issued a decision establishing ui s standard offer customer rates  commencing january   at a level below rates  as directed by the restructuring act described in detail below 
these standard offer customer rates supersede the rates that were included in the rate plan 
the decision also reduced the required amount of accelerated amortization in and under this decision  all other components of the rate plan are expected to remain in effect through the connecticut office of consumer counsel occ  the statutory representative of consumer interests in public utility matters  appealed the dpuc s standard offer decision to the connecticut superior court  challenging the dpuc s determination of ui s average prices in rates from which a reduction is required by the restructuring act 
on february   the superior court dismissed the occ s appeal from the dpuc s decision  but ui is unable to predict  at this time  whether the occ will appeal from the superior court s decision to the connecticut appellate court 
on february   the connecticut attorney general and the occ petitioned the dpuc to initiate a proceeding and hold a hearing concerning the need to decrease ui s rates by reason of ui s having earned a return on regulated common equity more than above the authorized level of for at least six consecutive months 
ui believes that a hearing would confirm that ui has complied with the dpuc ordered earnings sharing mechanism in ui s rate plan  and it will contest vigorously any arguments for a rate decrease 
in april  connecticut enacted public act the restructuring act  a massive and complex statute designed to restructure the state s regulated electric utility industry 
as a result of the restructuring act  the business of generating and selling electricity directly to consumers has been opened to competition 
these business activities are separated from the business of delivering electricity to consumers  also known as the transmission and distribution business 
the business of delivering electricity remains with the incumbent franchised utility companies including ui which continue to be regulated by the dpuc as distribution companies 
under the restructuring act  all of ui s customers are able to choose their power supply providers 
until january   ui is required to offer full standard offer electric service  under regulated rates  to all customers who do not choose alternate power supply providers 
the standard offer rates must be at least below the average prices in under current regulatory provisions  ui s financial condition is not affected materially by whether customers choose alternate suppliers to ui s standard offer electric service 
on december   ui and enron power marketing  inc epmi entered into a wholesale power supply agreement  a ppa entitlements transfer agreement and related agreements documenting a four year standard offer power supply arrangement and the assumption of all of ui s long term purchased power agreements  effective january  under these agreements  epmi supplies the generation services needed by ui to meet its standard offer obligations for the four year standard offer period at a fixed price 
the agreements with epmi also include a financially settled contract for differences related to certain call rights of epmi and put rights of ui with respect to ui s entitlements in seabrook unit and in millstone unit  and ui s provision to epmi of certain ancillary products and services associated with those nuclear entitlements  which provisions terminate at the earlier of december  or the date that ui sells its nuclear interests 
the agreements do not restrict ui s right to sell to third parties ui s ownership interests in those nuclear generation units or the generated energy actually attributable to its ownership interests 
the restructuring act requires that ui must attempt to divest its ownership interests in its nuclear fueled power plants prior to in order to recover any stranded costs associated with its power plants 
on october   in its unbundling plan filing with the dpuc under the restructuring act  and in other regulatory dockets  ui stated that it plans to divest its nuclear generation ownership interests of seabrook unit in new hampshire and of millstone station unit in connecticut by the end of  in accordance with the restructuring act 
on april   the dpuc approved ui s plan for divesting its ownership interest in millstone unit by participating in an auction process for all three of the generating units at millstone station  which was concluded on august   when dominion resources  inc agreed to purchase millstone units and  and of millstone unit for billion 
the purchase price agreed to for ui s ownership interest in unit  which is subject to adjustments for expenditures and eventualities prior to the date of closing on the sale  is approximately million  exclusive of nuclear fuel 
ui s share of the proceeds from the sale of the nuclear fuel inventory at the date of closing on the sale is estimated to be approximately million 
the sale is scheduled to be consummated on or about april  or as soon thereafter as all requisite regulatory approvals are received 
on december   ui and the connecticut light and power company filed with the dpuc for its approval their plan to divest their respective interests in seabrook unit by an auction process 
the dpuc has commenced hearings on this divestiture plan 
liquidity and capital resources uil holdings capital requirements are presently projected as follows millions cash on hand beginning of year funds from operations less dividends subtotal less capital expenditures and other expenditures ui uri total capital expenditures plus net cash from plant sales cash available to pay debt maturities and redemptions less maturities and mandatory redemptions optional redemptions external financing requirements surplus plus issuance and sale of senior notes increase decrease in short term borrowings short term borrowings end of year excludes million seabrook unit operating deposit and restricted cash of american payment systems  inc of million 
funds from operations less dividends  capital expenditures and external financing requirements are estimates based on current earnings and cash flow projections 
the estimate of cash from plant sales for is based on current projections for the millstone unit sale anticipated on or about april  the estimate for cash from plant sales for is based on speculative pricing and other projections for the sale of seabrook unit  including a sale date in early all of these estimates are subject to change due to future events and conditions that may be substantially different from those used in developing the projections 
all capital requirements that exceed available cash will have to be provided by external financing 
although there is no commitment to provide such financing from any source of funds  other than a million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks  future external financing needs are expected to be satisfied by the issuance of additional short term and long term debt 
the continued availability of these methods of financing will be dependent on many factors  including conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  and future income and cash flow
