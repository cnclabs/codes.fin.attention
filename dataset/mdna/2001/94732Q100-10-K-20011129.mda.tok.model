overview interland is a leading web hosting company that offers a broad range of business class hosting products and services  including shared and dedicated hosting services  electronic commerce and other applications hosting services  and other web hosting related products and services 
historically  the company had provided a variety of computer products and related services through its pc systems  spectek  and web hosting business segments 
during fiscal  the company discontinued its pc systems business  its computer manufacturing business  and spectek  its memory products business 
see the note entitled discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as a result  following the disposition of these business segments  the company has become exclusively a web hosting company 
the company was originally established on april  as micron electronics  inc through the merger of three businesses micron computer  inc  micron custom manufacturing services  inc and zeos international  ltd 
the web hosting business  the company s continuing operation  was formed through the acquisition and integration of five companies between and on august   the company acquired of the outstanding stock of netlimited  inc dba hostpro  a web and applications hosting provider 
on september   the company acquired the property and equipment of micron internet services  formerly a division of micron technology  a provider of dedicated  nationwide dial up and broadband internet access  virtual private network solutions and e commerce services 
on december   the company acquired lightrealm  inc a kirkland  washington based web and applications hosting and internet access company serving small and medium sized businesses 
on march   the company acquired worldwide internet publishing corporation  a boca raton  florida based web hosting company that also served small and medium sized businesses 
on august   the company acquired interland  inc interland georgia  an atlanta  georgia based provider of a broad range of web hosting  applications hosting and other related web based business solutions specifically designed to meet the needs of small and medium sized businesses 
in connection with the acquisition of interland georgia  micron electronics  inc changed its name to interland  inc 
and its trading symbol to inld 
the company s principal executive offices are located at peachtree center avenue  suite  atlanta georgia 
interland s business is rapidly evolving and has a limited operating history 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its revenues and operating results  including our cost of revenues and other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
the company does not believe that its historical growth rates are an indication of future results 
in addition  the company s financial results for fiscal only reflect the integration of interland georgia for days 
revenues are primarily generated by providing shared and dedicated hosting services  e commerce and other applications hosting services  and other web hosting related products and services 
revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
hosting contracts generally are for service periods ranging from one to months and typically require up front fees 
these fees  including set up fees for hosting services  are deferred and recognized ratably over the customers expected service period 
cost of revenues is mainly comprised of compensation and other expenses for data center and provisioning operations  internet connectivity and other related telecommunications expense  and depreciation and amortization of capital and intangibles related to data center equipment and operations 
interland s operating expenses consist of sales  marketing and technical support  which is mainly comprised of compensation costs and costs associated with technical support and marketing the company s products and services 
compensation costs include salaries and related benefits  commissions and bonuses 
marketing expenses include the costs of direct mail  advertising and other mass market programs  and general and administrative  which is mainly comprised of compensation and related expenses  occupancy costs  and depreciation and amortization of capital and intangible assets related to the engineering  development and administrative functions 
the company intends to invest heavily in sales and marketing to expand its customer base  enhance the efficiency of its infrastructure to accommodate additional customers and in development of future services 
in addition  the company intends to continue to expand and develop new sales channels and relationships 
the company s future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitability prior to depletion of cash reserves and to raise funds thereafter  if needed 
while management currently believes that they have adequate resources to maintain planned operations for at least one year from the balance sheet date  they cannot assure you that the company will be profitable in the future under its current web and applications hosting model or that adequate funding will be available to allow it to continue operations subsequent to the one year time period 
the company does not expect to generate positive cash flows from ongoing operations until the end of fiscal however  the company s current financial forecast indicates that there are sufficient cash reserves on hand until the company reaches positive cash flows from ongoing operations

certain factors you should carefully consider the following factors and all other information contained in this form k before you make any investment decisions with respect to the company s securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks the company faces 
if any of the adverse events described in the following factors actually occur or interland does not accomplish necessary events or objectives described in the factors  its business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected  the trading price of the company s common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
interland has incurred losses since inception  and it expects to incur losses for at least the next seven quarters 
the company has incurred net losses and losses from operations for each period from inception through fiscal interland does not expect to generate positive cash flow from ongoing operations until the end of fiscal operating expenses could increase as a result of adapting network infrastructure to accommodate additional customers  increasing sales and marketing efforts  broadening customer support capabilities  integrating the interland georgia and hostpro businesses and expanding administrative resources in anticipation of future growth 
to the extent that increases in expenses are not offset by increased revenues  the company s results of operations and financial condition would be materially affected 
even if interland achieves profitability  it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
interland s historical financial information will not be representative of its future results 
since the company has sold its non hosting businesses  its historical financial information  contained in previous filings with the securities and exchange commission  will not be representative of its future operating results 
including the operations of the non hosting businesses which are classified as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements web hosting revenues represented less than and of the company s total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  the company s financial results for fiscal only reflect the integration of interland georgia for days 
interland has a limited operating history and its business model is still evolving  which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects 
the company s limited operating history makes evaluating its business operations and prospects difficult 
the company s range of service offerings has changed since its inception and its business model is still new and developing 
because some of interland s services are new  the market for them is uncertain 
as a result  the revenues and income potential of the company s business  as well as the potential benefits of the merger with interland georgia  may be difficult to evaluate 
interland s quarterly operating results may fluctuate and its future revenues and profitability are uncertain 
the company s past operating results have been subject to fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis 
interland may also experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to a wide variety of factors 
because of these fluctuations  comparisons of operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
factors that may cause operating results to fluctuate include  but are not limited to demand for and market acceptance of the company s services  introductions of new services or enhancements by interland and its competitors  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the internet generally or the company s hosting operations specifically  the mix of services delivered by interland or its competitors  customer retention  the timing and success of the company s advertising and marketing efforts and introductions of new services to customers and the timing and success of the marketing efforts and introductions of new services to customers of its resellers  increased competition and consolidation within the web hosting and applications hosting markets  changes in the company s pricing policies and the pricing policies of its competitors  gains or losses of key strategic relationships  and other general and industry specific economic factors 
the company cannot provide any assurances about the extent to which it will be successful in achieving any plans to increase the size of its customer base  the amount of services it offers or the amount  if any  of increase in revenues it will experience during the next fiscal year  or beyond 
in addition  relatively large portions of interland s expenses are fixed in the short term  and therefore its results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
also  if the company were unable to continue using third party products in its service offerings  its service development costs could increase significantly 
in addition  the terrorist acts of september  have created an uncertain economic environment and the company cannot predict the impact of these events  any subsequent terrorist acts or of any related military action  on its customers or business 
the company believes that  in light of these events  some businesses may curtail spending on information technology  which could also affect its quarterly results in the future 
interland s stock price may be volatile 
the market price of the company s common stock has experienced a significant decline in the last year 
the price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to several factors  such as the company s failure to experience the benefits of the merger as quickly as anticipated  or at all  or an increase over estimates of the costs of or operational difficulties arising from the merger  the failure of the impact of the merger on the company s financial results to be in line with the expectations of financial analysts  variations in actual and anticipated operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  variations in actual and anticipated operating results of customers or competitors  material reductions in spending by customers  announcements by interland or its competitors regarding new service introductions  the volatility inherent in stock within the sectors within which the company conducts business  any subsequent terrorist acts or of any related military action  general decline in economic conditions  and reductions in the volume of trading in the company s common stock 
interland operates in a new and evolving market with uncertain prospects for growth and may not be able to sustain growth in its customer base 
the market for web hosting and applications hosting services for small and medium sized businesses has only recently begun to develop and is evolving rapidly 
the company s future growth  if any  will depend upon the willingness of small and medium sized businesses to outsource web and applications hosting services  the company s ability to increase its average revenues per customer  and its ability to retain customers 
the market for interland s services may not develop further  consumers may not widely adopt its services and significant numbers of businesses or organizations may not use the internet for commerce and communication 
if this market fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  or if the company s services do not achieve broader market acceptance  the company will not be able to grow its customer base 
in addition  the company must be able to differentiate itself from its competition through its service offerings and brand recognition 
these activities may be more expensive than the company anticipates  and it may not be successful in differentiating itself  achieving market acceptance of its services or selling additional services to its existing customer base 
interland s target market presents substantial risks 
the company intends to concentrate on serving small and medium sized businesses smb 
the smb market contains many businesses that will not be successful  and are consequently at substantially greater risk for non collectible accounts receivable  and for non renewal 
moreover  a significant portion of this target market is highly sensitive to price  and may be lost to a low cost competitor 
because few businesses in this target market employ trained technologists  they tend to generate a high number of customer service and technical support calls 
the expense of responding to these calls is considerable  and the expense is likely to increase in direct proportion to revenue  potentially limiting the scalability of the business 
additionally  if the customer becomes dissatisfied with the company s response to such calls  cancellation  non payment  or non renewal becomes more likely 
interland s strategy for minimizing the negative aspects of its target market include continued expenditures on sales and marketing to replace failing customers  capitalizing on planned efficiencies to become a profitable provider at the lowest sustainable price  automating customer care and technical support to reduce the cost per call  and to minimize the time spent by company personnel  intensive training and supervision of customer care and technical support personnel to maximize customer satisfaction  minimizing the company s concentration of credit risk which consists principally of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments and trade and other receivables 
the company invests its cash in credit instruments of highly rated financial institutions and performs periodic evaluations of the credit standing of these financial institutions 
no assurance can be given  however  that any of these measures will be successful  and the company s failure to manage these risks could have a material negative effect on the company s revenues  costs  and prospects 
interland s customer base includes a significant number of businesses that currently face increasing difficulty in obtaining funding to support their operations 
many of the company s customers are businesses  including internet based businesses that have traditionally been initially funded by venture capital firms and then through public securities offerings 
funding alternatives for these businesses have become more limited than in the past 
many of these customers have ceased or reduced their operations  and it has become increasingly difficult for the company to collect revenues from these businesses 
if the market for technology and internet based businesses is not supported by the private and public investors who have funded these customers  the company faces the risk that these customers may cease  curtail or limit web site operations 
if this continues to occur  the company could experience a loss of revenues associated with these customers and will then have to increase sales to other businesses using the internet in order to preserve and grow revenue 
if the company is successful in increasing sales to other businesses  it will incur the expenses associated with these new customers  such as sales and marketing expenses  including commissions  and implementation costs 
as a result  to preserve and grow revenue  the company will have to increase sales by substantially more than the amount of lost revenue 
if the company does not successfully integrate the operations and personnel of interland georgia in a timely manner  this will disrupt its business and could negatively affect its operating results 
the company s acquisition of interland georgia involves risks related to the integration and management of interland georgia s operations and personnel 
the integration will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt the company s business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
the company must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and telecommunications systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
the company may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating the operations of both companies  including potential incompatibility of business cultures  perceived adverse changes in business focus  potential conflicts in marketing or other important relationships  potential operating inefficiencies and increased costs associated with having and integrating different information and telecommunications systems currently used by each of hostpro and interland georgia  potential decline in the level of customer service and customer satisfaction  and the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns 
the company s headquarters were located in boise  idaho  while interland georgia s headquarters were located in atlanta  georgia 
in conjunction with the merger  the company moved its headquarters to atlanta  georgia 
the integration of interland georgia s operations and personnel may be difficult due to the geographic distance between the company s previous and current headquarters 
in addition  the company has completed a number of other acquisitions of hosting companies and is still in the process of completing the integration of these businesses 
this could make the integration of interland georgia more difficult 
if this integration effort is not successful  the results of operations could be adversely affected  employee morale could decline  key employees could leave and customers could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones 
in addition  the attention and effort devoted to the integration of the two companies will significantly divert management s attention from other important issues  such as expansion of the combined customer base  which could negatively affect the company s business and operating results 
the benefits of the merger with interland georgia may be lower than expected and the costs associated with the merger could be higher than expected  which could harm the company s financial results and cause a decline in the value of its common stock 
the company expects to realize cost reductions due to synergies created by the merger with interland georgia in areas such as integration and expansion of nationwide technical support capabilities over a larger customer base  integration of information and telecommunications systems  marketing the larger combined business  elimination of excess data center capacity and economies of scale for the combined company s telecommunications costs 
although the company expects that it will realize cost synergies with the merger  it cannot guarantee that it will realize these cost synergies or state the amount of any cost synergies with any certainty 
the company expects to incur costs associated with the consolidation and integration of the companies services and operations 
if the total costs of the merger and related consolidation and integration exceed estimates  or if the cost synergies of the merger are less than expected  the company s financial results would suffer 
any shortfall in anticipated operating results could cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline 
in addition  the market price of interland s common stock could decline significantly if it does not experience the business benefits of the merger as quickly or in as great amounts as security analysts expect 
the company has incurred significant accounting charges relating to the acquisition of interland georgia  which will delay projected achievement of profitability for the web hosting business 
the company has accounted for the acquisition of interland georgia using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the purchase price of interland georgia has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as a result  based upon the purchase price of million  the company has recorded million of intangible assets and million of goodwill on its balance sheet  which will result in annual amortization expense of the intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal under accounting standards existing at august  goodwill will be evaluated annually for impairment and any potential impairment will affect the company s financial results in the future 
if the company acquires additional companies  customer accounts or technologies  it may face risks similar to those it currently faces in connection with the merger with interland georgia 
as part of its strategy to grow the web hosting business  the company has made a number of acquisitions and investments  and it may continue to pursue acquisitions of businesses or assets that it believes are complementary to its business 
the company will be required to record material goodwill and other intangible assets in the likely event the purchase price of the acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in the past  this has resulted in significant amortization charges  and these charges may increase in future periods as the company continues its acquisition strategy 
the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings anticipated to be achieved 
if the company acquires another company  it will likely raise the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions as discussed above with respect to its merger with interland georgia 
for example  the company may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel  operations  acquired technology and customer accounts into its business 
furthermore  the company may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to existing shareholders 
as a result  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the company cannot assure you of the timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect future acquisitions may have on its operating results 
interland could incur liabilities in the future relating to its pc systems business 
the company could incur liabilities arising from the sale of the pc systems business to gtg pc 
according to the terms of the agreement with gtg pc  the company agreed to retain liabilities relating to the operation of the pc systems business arising prior to the closing of the transaction  including liabilities for taxes  contingent liabilities and liabilities for accounts payable accrued prior to the closing 
the company also agreed to indemnify gtg pc and its affiliates for any breach of the company s representations and warranties contained in the agreement for a period of two years  or for the applicable statute of limitations for matters related to taxes 
this indemnification obligation is capped at million 
except for claims for fraud or injunctive relief  this indemnity is the exclusive remedy for any breach of the company s representations  warranties and covenants contained in the agreement with gtg pc 
accordingly  in the future  interland could be required to make payments to gtg pc and its affiliates in accordance with the agreement in which it sold the pc systems business  which could adversely affect its future results of operations 
the micron technology foundation is a significant shareholder and is therefore able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval 
as of october   the micron technology foundation owned approximately of interland s outstanding common stock  although minnesota law limits its right to vote any shares in excess of of the company s outstanding common stock 
under the terms of an agreement with the company  the micron technology foundation has agreed  among other things  not to sell any of its shares for a period of nine months following the interland georgia merger  subject to limited exceptions 
so long as the micron technology foundation continues to own a substantial portion of interland s outstanding common stock  the micron technology foundation will have the ability to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  and potentially could affect the company s management and corporate policies 
the level of the micron technology foundation s ownership of interland s common stock may limit the company s ability to complete future equity financing 
interland may be required to pay sales and use taxes related to its discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  the company began to collect and remit applicable sales or use taxes in nearly all states 
the company is a party to agreements with nearly all states  which generally limit its liability  if any  for non remittance of sales and use taxes prior to such agreements effective dates 
the company has previously accrued a liability for the estimated settlement cost of issues related to sales and use taxes not covered by such agreements 
management believes the resolution of any matters relating to the non remittance of sales or use taxes will not materially affect the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this potential liability will remain with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
interland may not effectively execute its web hosting strategy and  as a result  others may seize the market opportunity that it has identified 
if interland fails to execute its web hosting strategy in a timely or effective manner  its competitors may be able to seize the opportunity it has identified to address the web hosting needs of small and medium sized businesses 
interland s business strategy is complex and requires that it successfully and simultaneously complete many tasks  and the failure to complete any one of these may jeopardize its strategy as a whole 
execution of this strategy may be more difficult in light of the merger with interland georgia because the management team for the combined company have not have worked together for any significant period of time 
in order to be successful  the company will need to market its services and build its brand name effectively  provide reliable and cost effective services that can be expanded to meet the demands of its customers  develop new products and services  continue to enhance the efficiency of its infrastructure to accommodate additional customers  continue to expand its customer base  continue to respond to competitive developments  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other changes  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
interland faces intense competition 
the web hosting and applications hosting markets are highly competitive and are becoming more so 
there are few substantial barriers to entry  and the company expects that it will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
the company may not have the resources  expertise or other competitive factors to compete successfully in the future 
many of interland s competitors have greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more rapidly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company can 
in an effort to gain market share  some of interland s competitors have offered  and may in the future offer  web hosting services similar to interland at lower prices or with incentives not matched by interland  including free start up and domain name registration  periods of free service  low priced internet access or free software 
in addition  some of its competitors may be able to provide customers with additional benefits  including reduced communications costs  which could reduce the overall cost of their services relative to the company 
interland may not be able to reduce the pricing of its services or offer incentives in response to the actions of its competitors without harming its business 
because of the fierce competition in the web hosting and applications hosting industry  the number of competitors could lead to a surplus in service providers  leading to further reductions in the prices of services 
the company also believes that the market in which it competes is likely to consolidate further in the near future  which could result in increased price and other competition that could damage its business 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms that provide a wide array of information technology services and computer hardware suppliers 
these competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as xo communications and verio 
in addition  large companies such as at t  sprint and worldcom have entered or indicated their intent to enter into one of more of these markets 
interland s ability to successfully market its services could be substantially impaired if it is unable to deploy new internet applications or if new internet applications it deploys prove to be unreliable  defective or incompatible 
the company cannot assure you that it will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of internet application services in the future 
if any newly introduced internet applications suffer from reliability  quality or compatibility problems  market acceptance of its services could be greatly hindered and its ability to attract new customers could be adversely affected 
the company cannot assure you that new applications it deploys will be free from any reliability  quality or compatibility problems 
if the company incurs increased costs or is unable  for technical or other reasons  to host and manage new internet applications or enhancements of existing applications  its ability to successfully market its services could be substantially impaired 
in addition  the company cannot assure you that any new services or applications will be accepted by its customers 
impairment of interland s intellectual property rights could negatively affect its business or could allow competitors to minimize any advantage that interland s proprietary technology may give it 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its services 
at this point  interland has no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the web hosting market that it serves 
while the company may file patent applications on particular aspects of its technology  it cannot be sure that it will receive any patents 
while it is the company s practice to require all of its employees to enter into agreements containing non disclosure  non competition and non solicitation restrictions and covenants  and while its agreements with some of its customers and suppliers include provisions prohibiting or restricting the disclosure of proprietary information  the company cannot be sure that these contractual arrangements or the other steps it takes to protect its proprietary rights will prove sufficient to prevent illegal use of its proprietary rights or to deter independent  third party development of similar proprietary assets 
policing unauthorized use of products or methods of operation and fully protecting the company s proprietary rights is difficult  and it cannot guarantee that the steps it has taken to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products and services are offered 
further  the company is currently  and may in the future  be involved in legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of its  or of a third party s  intellectual property rights 
the company expects that participants in the web hosting market will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in its industry segment grows 
intellectual property litigation is typically extremely costly and can be disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
in addition  any adverse decisions could subject the company to significant liabilities  require it to seek licenses from others  prevent it from using  licensing or selling certain of its products and services  or cause severe disruptions to its operations or the markets in which it competes  any one of which could dramatically impact its business and results of operations 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it uses may infringe on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of certain asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement relating to its discontinued operations prior to the balance sheet date 
resolution of these claims could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and cash flows 
interland faces risks relating to existing litigation 
interland is defending a contract dispute lawsuit filed on october  in dallas county  texas court seeking damages of approximately million for goods purchased by our pc systems business 
the company removed the case to federal court  and counterclaimed for legal fees owed by the plaintiff for legal fees they had agreed to indemnify the company for that were incurred on an unrelated patent lawsuit 
these legal fees amounted to approximately million 
this claim is currently in the early stages of discovery  and the company is therefore unable to estimate total expenses  or possible loss that may ultimately be connected with the matter 
this potential liability will remain with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
the company is defending a consumer class action lawsuit filed in the federal district court of minnesota based on the alleged sale of defective computers 
no class has been certified in the case 
the case involves a claim that the company sold computer products with a defect that may cause errors when information is written to a floppy disk 
substantially similar lawsuits have been filed against other major computer manufacturers 
the case is currently in the early stages of discovery  and the company is therefore unable to estimate total expenses  possible loss or range of loss that may ultimately be connected with the matter 
this potential liability will remain with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
the company is defending an employee class action lawsuit claim filed in the us district court for idaho 
the case involves alleged violations of the fair labor standards act  particularly failures to pay non exempt employees overtime for hours worked in excess of in a week as well as other alleged violations of the flsa and state wage and hour laws 
no class has been certified in the case 
the case is currently in the early stages of discovery  and the company is therefore unable to estimate total expenses  possible loss or range of loss that may ultimately be connected with the matter 
this potential liability will remain with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operation s products or processes  it may be forced to defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the company evaluates all such claims and has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of claims for alleged infringement as of the respective dates of the balance sheets included in this report 
resolution of these claims could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and cash flows 
interland will rely heavily on its key personnel 
the future success of interland will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
the company experiences strong competition for such personnel in the web hosting industry 
the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  and information technology  engineering and technical support resources  could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company cannot assure you that it will not lose key personnel or that the loss of any key personnel will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient telecommunications network capacity at reasonable costs  it may not be able to provide services at prices acceptable to its customers  thereby reducing demand for its services 
the success of interland will depend upon the capacity  reliability and security of its network infrastructure  including the capacity leased from its telecommunications network suppliers 
interland s network currently delivers service through cable wireless  mcleod  qwest  electric lightwave  genuity  worldcom  level  xo  sprint and touch america 
some of these suppliers are also competitors 
the company s operating results depend  in part  upon the pricing and availability of telecommunications network capacity from a limited number of providers 
if capacity is not available as the company s customers usage increases  the company s network may not be able to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission capacity  reliability or performance 
in addition  the company s business would suffer if its network suppliers increased the prices for their services and it were unable to pass along any increased costs to its customers 
any failure on the part of the company or the part of its third party suppliers to achieve or maintain high data transmission capacity  reliability or performance could significantly reduce customer demand for its services  damage its business reputation and increase its costs 
interland depends on its reseller sales channel to market and sell many of its services 
interland does not control its resellers  and if it fails to develop or maintain good relations with resellers  it may not achieve the growth in customers and revenues that it expects 
an element of the strategy for the company s growth is to further develop the use of third parties that resell its services 
many of these resellers are web development or web consulting companies that also sell interland s web hosting services  but that generally do not have established customer bases to which they can market these services 
the company is not currently dependent on any one reseller to generate a significant level of business  but it has benefited from business generated by the reseller channel 
although interland attempts to provide its resellers with incentives such as price discounts on its services that the resellers seek to resell at a profit  the failure of its services to be commercially accepted in some markets  whether as a result of a reseller s performance or otherwise  could cause its current resellers to discontinue their relationships with us  and it may not be successful in establishing additional reseller relationships as needed 
interland will be subject to changes in technology and industry standards 
in the web and applications hosting industry  service providers must keep pace with evolving technologies in order to offer relevant  sophisticated services on a timely basis to meet rapidly changing customer demands 
the future success of interland will depend  in part  upon its ability to offer services that incorporate leading technologies  address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of its current and prospective web and applications hosting customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the market for web hosting services is characterized by rapidly changing and unproven technologies  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  emerging competition and frequent introductions of new services 
to be successful  the company must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of its services  including its proprietary technologies  and modify its business strategies accordingly 
interland could also incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes 
technological advances may have the effect of encouraging some of the company s current or future customers to rely on in house personnel and equipment to furnish the services that it currently provides 
if the company is unable to maintain the compatibility of its services with products offered by its vendors  it could lose or fail to attract customers 
interland believes that its ability to compete successfully also depends upon the continued compatibility of its services with products offered by various vendors 
enhanced or newly developed third party products may not be compatible with its infrastructure  and such products may not adequately address the needs of its customers 
although interland currently intends to support emerging standards  industry standards may not be established  and  even if they are established  the company may not be able to conform to these new standards in a timely fashion in order to maintain a competitive position in the market 
the company s failure to conform to the prevailing standard  or the failure of a common standard to emerge  could cause it to lose customers or fail to attract new customers 
in addition  products  services or technologies developed by others could render the company s services noncompetitive or obsolete 
interland s ability to attract customers is dependent on the reliable performance and growth of use of the internet 
use of the internet for retrieving  sharing and transferring information among businesses  consumers  suppliers and partners has recently begun to increase rapidly 
the adoption of the internet for information retrieval and exchange  commerce and communication  particularly by those enterprises that have historically relied upon alternative means of information gathering  commerce and communications generally requires the adoption of a new medium of conducting business and exchanging information 
if the internet as a commercial or business medium fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  the company would not be able to grow its customer base as quickly as desired and its customers would be less likely to require more complex  higher services from it 
as a web and applications hosting company  interland s success will depend in large part on continued growth in the use of the internet 
the lack of continued growth in the usage of the internet would adversely affect its business because it would not gain additional customers and its existing customers might not have any further use for its services 
internet usage and growth may be inhibited for a number of reasons  such as inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  uncertainty of legal and regulatory issues concerning the use of the internet  inconsistent quality of service  lack of availability of cost effective  reliable  high speed service  and failure of internet use to expand internationally 
if internet usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth  or its performance and reliability may decline 
for example  web sites have experienced interruptions in service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently  use of the internet as a commercial or business medium could in the future grow more slowly or decline 
interland is vulnerable to system failures  which could harm its reputation  cause its customers to seek reimbursement for services and cause its customers to seek another provider for services 
the company must be able to operate the systems that manage its network around the clock without interruption 
its operations will depend upon its ability to protect its network infrastructure  equipment and customer files against damage from human error  fire  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
although the company has attempted to build redundancy into its networks  its networks are currently subject to various points of failure 
for example  a problem with one of its routers devices that move information from one computer network to another or switches could cause an interruption in the services the company provides to a portion of its customers 
in the past  the company has experienced periodic interruptions in service 
in addition  failure of any of its telecommunications providers to provide the data communications capacity that the company requires  as a result of human error  a natural disaster or other operational disruption  could result in interruptions in services 
any future interruptions could cause customers or end users to seek damages for losses incurred  require the company to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities  damage the company s reputation for reliable service  cause existing customers to cancel their contracts  or make it more difficult for the company to attract new customers 
interland offers some customers a service level warranty 
under these policies  it guarantees that those customers web sites will be available at least of the time in each calendar month for as long as the customer is using its web hosting services 
if the company were to experience widespread system failure  it could incur significant costs under those warranties 
interland s data centers and networks may be vulnerable to security breaches 
a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the need for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
some of the company s services rely on security technology licensed from third parties that provides the encryption and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of confidential information 
despite the design and implementation of a variety of network security measures by the company  unauthorized access  computer viruses  accidental or intentional actions and other disruptions could occur 
in the past  the company has experienced  and in the future it may experience  delays or interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees or others 
in addition  inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information  such as credit card and bank account numbers stored in the company s computer systems 
these security problems could result in the company s liability and could also cause the loss of existing customers and potential customers 
in addition  third parties could interfere with the operation of customers web sites through intentional attacks including causing an overload of traffic to these web sites 
although the company intends to continue to implement industry standard security measures  third parties may be able to overcome any measures that it implements 
the costs required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems could be prohibitively expensive and the efforts to address such problems could result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service to customers  and harm the company s reputation and growth 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
disruption of interland s services caused by unknown software defects could harm its business and reputation 
the company s service offerings depend on complex software  including proprietary software tools and software licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company may not discover software defects that affect its new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although interland has not experienced any material software defects to date  it is possible that defects may occur in the software 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage its reputation or increase its service costs  cause it to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert its development resources 
providing services to customers with critical web sites and web based applications could potentially expose interland to lawsuits for customers lost profits or other damages 
because the company s web hosting and applications hosting services are critical to many of its customers businesses  any significant interruption in those services could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to its customers as well as negative publicity and additional expenditures for it to correct the problem 
although the standard terms and conditions of the company s customer contracts disclaim liability for any such damages  a customer could still bring a lawsuit against it claiming lost profits or other consequential damages as the result of a service interruption or other web site or application problems that the customer may ascribe to it 
a court might not enforce any limitations on its liability  and the outcome of any lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and legal and policy considerations even if the company believes it would have meritorious defenses to any such claims 
in such cases  it could be liable for substantial damage awards 
such damage awards might exceed its liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts  which would seriously harm its business 
interland could face liability for information distributed through its network 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or distributed through their networks is currently unsettled 
online services companies could be subject to claims under both united states and foreign law for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  violation of securities laws or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials distributed through their networks 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose such liability upon other entities are currently pending against other companies 
in addition  organizations and individuals have sent unsolicited commercial e mails from servers hosted by service providers to massive numbers of people  typically to advertise products or services 
this practice  known as spamming  can lead to complaints against service providers that enable such activities  particularly where recipients view the materials received as offensive 
the company may  in the future  receive letters from recipients of information transmitted by its customers objecting to such transmission 
although the company prohibits its customers by contract from spamming  it cannot assure you that its customers will not engage in this practice  which could subject it to claims for damages 
in addition  the company may become subject to proposed legislation that would impose liability for or prohibit the transmission over the internet of some types of information 
other countries may also enact legislation or take action that could impose liability on the company or cause it not to be able to operate in those countries 
the imposition upon the company and other online services of potential liability for information carried on or distributed through its systems could require it to implement measures to reduce its exposure to this liability  which may require it to expend substantial resources  or to discontinue service offerings 
the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals also could affect the growth of internet use 
interland s business may be impacted by government regulation and legal uncertainties 
only a small body of laws and regulations currently applies specifically to access to  or commerce on  the internet 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  however  laws and regulations with respect to the internet may be adopted at federal  state and local levels  covering issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with internet communications 
the company cannot fully predict the nature of future legislation and the manner in which government authorities may interpret and enforce 
as a result  interland and its customers could be subject to potential liability under future legislation  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
for example  if legislation were adopted in the us or internationally that makes transacting business over the internet less favorable or otherwise curtails the growth of the internet  the company s business would suffer 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations might decrease the growth of the internet  which in turn could decrease the demand for the company s services or increase the cost of doing business or in some other manner harm its business 
in addition  applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
these laws generally pre date the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not consider or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to laws intended to address these issues could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for the company s services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs  or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on its business 
in addition  because its services are available over the internet virtually worldwide  and because the company facilitates sales by its customers to end users located in multiple states and foreign countries  such jurisdictions may claim that the company is required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in those states or that it have a permanent establishment in the foreign country 
interland s international operations are subject to risks 
the company derived approximately of its revenues from international sales for the year ended august  international business is subject to a number of special risks  including different regulatory requirements  different privacy  censorship and liability standards and regulations  less protective intellectual property laws  different technology standards  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities among countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
substantial future sales of shares by shareholders could negatively affect interland s stock price 
if interland s shareholders sell substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the public market  the market price of the company s common stock could decline 
under a shareholder agreement  mr 
kocher and some interland georgia shareholders have agreed not to sell their shares of interland common stock  representing approximately of the company s outstanding common stock for a period of nine months after the closing of the interland georgia merger  subject to limited exceptions 
additionally  the micron technology foundation  which owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock  agreed not to sell any shares of interland s common stock beneficially held by it for a period of nine months after the closing of the interland georgia merger  subject to limited exceptions 
as a result  after these lockup provisions expire  approximately of the company s outstanding common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market subject to volume limitations under rule of the securities act 
furthermore  these shareholders will have the right to require interland to register their shares for sale pursuant to an existing registration rights agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s liquid investments and a majority of its debt are at fixed interest rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of august   approximately of the company s liquid investments mature within three months and mature within one year 
as of august   management believes the reported amounts of liquid investments and debt to be reasonable approximations of their fair values and has the ability and intent to hold these instruments to maturity 
as a result  management believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of financial instruments is minimal 
the company uses the us dollar as its functional currency
