approximately  positions were eliminated worldwide under this program see note  restructuring programs and cost reduction 
outlook the company expects the overall slowdown in the us economy and the corresponding industry wide decrease in photographic activity to continue through the first two quarters of before recovering in the second half of the year 
the company will continue to take actions to minimize the financial impact of this slowdown 
these actions include efforts to better manage production and inventory levels while at the same time reducing discretionary spending to further hold down costs 
the company will also consider additional actions  including reductions in staff in certain areas of the company  aimed at making its operations more cost competitive and improving margins 
during  the company completed an ongoing program of real estate divestitures and portfolio rationalization that contributed to other income charges reaching an annual average of million over the past three years

the euro the treaty on european union provided that an economic and monetary union emu be established in europe whereby a single european currency  the euro  replaces the currencies of participating member states 
the euro was introduced on january   at which time the value of participating member state currencies was irrevocably fixed against the euro and the european currency unit ecu was replaced at the rate of one euro to one ecu 
for the three year transitional period ending december   the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate  but as sub units of the euro 
new public debt will be issued in euros and existing debt may be redenominated into euros 
at the end of the transitional period  euro banknotes and coins will be issued  and the national currencies of the member states will cease to be legal tender no later than june  the countries that adopted the euro on january  are austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  and spain 
greece will now be part of the transition 
the company has operations in all of these countries 
as a result of the euro conversion  it is possible that selling prices of the company s products and services will experience downward pressure  as current price variations among countries are reduced due to easy comparability of euro prices across countries 
prices will tend to harmonize  although value added taxes and transportation costs will still justify price differentials 
adoption of the euro will probably accelerate existing market and pricing trends including pan european buying and general price erosion 
on the other hand  currency exchange and hedging costs will be reduced  lower prices and pan european buying will benefit the company in its purchasing endeavors  the number of banks and suppliers needed will be reduced  there will be less variation in payment terms  and it will be easier for the company to expand into new marketing channels such as mail order and internet marketing 
the company is in the process of making changes in areas such as marketing and pricing  purchasing  contracts  payroll  taxes  cash management and treasury operations 
under the no compulsion no prohibition rules  billing systems have been modified so that the company is now able to show total gross  value added tax  and net in euros on national currency invoices 
this enables customers to pay in the new euro currency if they wish to do so 
countries that have installed erp sap software in connection with the company s enterprise resource planning project are able to invoice and receive payments in euros as well as in other currencies 
systems for pricing  payroll and expense reimbursements will continue to use national currencies until year end the functional currencies of the company s operations in affected countries will remain the national currencies until approximately may except germany and austria november  when they will change to the euro 
systems changes for countries not on sap finland and greece are also being implemented in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in was million  as net earnings of  million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  provided  million of operating cash 
this was partially offset by increases in receivables of million  largely due to the timing of sales late in the fourth quarter  increases in inventories of million  reflecting lower than expected sales performance in the second half of the year particularly consumer films and paper and consumer digital camera sales  and decreases in liabilities excluding borrowings of million related primarily to severance payments for restructuring programs and reductions in accounts payable and accrued benefit costs

cash dividends per share of  payable quarterly  were declared in each of the years  and total cash dividends of approximately million  million and million were paid in  and  respectively 
net working capital excluding short term borrowings increased to  million from million at year end this increase is mainly attributable to lower payable levels and higher receivable and inventory balances  as discussed above 
capital additions were million in  with the majority of the spending supporting manufacturing productivity and quality improvements  new products including e commerce initiatives  digital photofinishing and digital cameras  and ongoing environmental and safety spending

summary of operating data a summary of operating data for and for the four years prior is shown on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and interest rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company may enter into derivative contracts 
see also note  financial instruments 
on january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated as a hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the transition adjustment was a pre tax loss of million million after tax recorded in other income charges for marking foreign exchange forward contracts to fair value  and a pre tax gain of million million after tax recorded in other comprehensive income for marking silver forward contracts to fair value 
these items were not displayed in separate captions as cumulative effects of a change in accounting principle  due to their immateriality 
the fair value of the contracts is reported in other current assets or in current payables 
the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of exchange rate risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales 
at december   the company had cash flow hedges for the euro  the canadian dollar  and the australian dollar  with maturity dates ranging from january to december at december   the fair value of all open foreign currency forward contracts was a pre tax unrealized loss of million 
of this pre tax loss  million has been deferred as a part of other comprehensive income while million has been charged to other income charges on the company s consolidated statement of earnings 
additionally  realized gains of approximately million pre tax  related to closed foreign currency contracts  have been deferred in other comprehensive income 
if all amounts deferred to other comprehensive income were to be realized  approximately million would be reclassified into cost of goods sold over the next twelve months  based on sales to third parties 
during the year  a realized gain of million pre tax was reclassified from other comprehensive income to cost of goods sold 
hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant 
the company does not apply hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts used to offset currency related changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
these contracts are marked to market through earnings at the same time that the exposed assets and liabilities are remeasured through earnings both in other income 
the majority of the contracts held by the company are denominated in euros  australian dollars  chinese renminbi  canadian dollars  and british pounds 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and increased  the company would incur losses of million and million on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  and  respectively 
such losses would be substantially offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged 
the company has entered into silver forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of price risk related to forecasted worldwide silver purchases 
the company used silver forward contracts to minimize virtually all of its exposure to increases in silver prices in at december   the company had open forward contracts  with maturity dates ranging from january to december  hedging virtually all of its planned silver requirements through the fourth quarter of at december   the fair value of open contracts was a pre tax unrealized loss of million  recorded in other comprehensive income 
if this amount were to be realized  million pre tax of this loss would be reclassified into cost of goods sold within the next twelve months 
during the year  a realized loss of million pre tax was recorded in cost of goods sold 
at december   realized losses of million pre tax  related to closed silver contracts  were recorded in other comprehensive income 
these losses will be reclassified into cost of goods sold as silver containing products are sold all within the next twelve months 
hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that  based on broker quoted termination values  if the price of silver decreased from spot rates at december  and  the fair value of silver forward contracts would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
such losses in fair value  if realized  would be offset by lower costs of manufacturing silver containing products 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities and  to a lesser extent  through investments in marketable securities 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated as well as foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of short term and long term borrowings are in fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings and marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
using a yield to maturity analysis  if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the current period s level of debt  the fair value of short term and long term borrowings would decrease million and million  respectively 
if december  interest rates increased about basis points with the december  level of debt  the fair value of short term and long term borrowings would decrease million and million  respectively 
the company s financial instrument counterparties are high quality investment or commercial banks with significant experience with such instruments 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by requiring specific minimum credit standards and diversification of counterparties 
the company has procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts 
the maximum credit exposure at december  was not significant to the company
