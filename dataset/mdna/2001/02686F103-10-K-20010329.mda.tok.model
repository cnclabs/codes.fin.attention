mortgage investments prior to the expiration of the partnership s reinvestment period in december  the partnership was engaged in the business of originating mortgage loans originated insured mortgages and acquiring mortgage loans acquired insured mortgages and  together with originated insured mortgages  referred to herein as insured mortgages 
in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement  the partnership is no longer authorized to originate or acquire insured mortgages and  consequently  its primary objective is to manage its portfolio of mortgage investments  all of which are insured as discussed below under section d or section of the national housing act of  as amended the national housing act 
the partnership is a liquidating partnership and as it continues to liquidate its mortgage investments and investors receive distributions of return of capital and taxable gains  investors should expect a reduction in earnings and distributions due to the decreasing mortgage base 
the partnership agreement states that the partnership will terminate on december   unless previously terminated under the provisions of the partnership agreement 
as of december   the partnership had invested in insured mortgages  with an aggregate amortized cost of approximately million  a face value of approximately million and a fair value of approximately million  as discussed below 
investment in insured mortgages the partnership s investment in insured mortgages is comprised of participation certificates evidencing a undivided beneficial interest in government insured multifamily mortgages issued or sold pursuant to programs of the federal housing administration fha fha insured certificates  mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma gnma mortgage backed securities and fha insured mortgage loans fha insured loans 
the mortgages underlying the fha insured certificates  gnma mortgage backed securities  and fha insured loans are non recourse first liens on multifamily residential developments or retirement homes 
the following is a discussion of the partnership s insured mortgage investments  along with the risks related to each type of investment a 
fully insured originated insured mortgages and acquired insured mortgages listed below is the partnership s aggregate investment in fully insured mortgages as of december  and december  fully insured originated mortgages number of mortgages amortized cost   face value   fair value   fully insured acquired mortgages number of gnma mortgage backed securities fha insured certificates fha insured loan amortized cost   face value   fair value   as of march   all of the partnership s fully insured mortgage investments are current with respect to the payment of principal and interest 
in addition to base interest payments from fully insured originated insured mortgages  the partnership is entitled to additional interest based on a percentage of the net cash flow from the underlying development and of the net proceeds from the refinancing  sale or other disposition of the underlying development referred to as participations

b 
coinsured mortgages under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such case  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage

the mortgage base decreased as a result of three mortgage dispositions since february with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million  representing an approximate decrease in the aggregate principal balance of the fully insured mortgages 
interest and other income decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the timing of temporary investment of mortgage disposition proceeds prior to distribution to unitholders 
asset management fees to related parties decreased for as compared to  due to the reduction in the mortgage base

liquidity and capital resources on october   criimi mae  the parent of the general partner  and criimi mae management  inc  an affiliate of criimi mae and provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code 
such bankruptcy filings could result in certain adverse effects to the partnership 
for example  as a debtor in possession  criimi mae will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the general partner or to the general partner of cmslp  the partnership s sub advisor  without approval from the bankruptcy court 
even though this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general partner and the partnership  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership 
such bankruptcy filings could also result in the potential need to replace criimi mae management  inc as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership 
on november   the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland  in greenbelt  maryland the bankruptcy court confirmed criimi mae s and criimi mae management  inc s third amended joint plan of reorganization as amended and supplemented by praecipes filed with the bankruptcy court on july  and  and november   the plan

although insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base  resulting from monthly mortgage payments or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses

net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the disposition of mortgages

net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to  due to a reduction in the amount of distributions paid to partners in cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the decrease in mortgage investment income  as discussed previously 
this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in receivables and other assets due to the receipt of mortgage payments that had been delinquent as of december  net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to  primarily due to proceeds received from the disposition of mortgages  as previously discussed 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the receipt of principal from scheduled payments  due to the reduction in mortgage base
