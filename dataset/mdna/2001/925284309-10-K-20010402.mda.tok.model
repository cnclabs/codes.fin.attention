item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as indicated in the paragraph above of item  this form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act and the securities act 
we have identified  using a preceding asterisk  various sentences within this form k that contain these forward looking statements  and words such as believe  anticipate  expect and intend and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements  but these are not the exclusive means of identifying these statements 
the forward looking statements included in this form k involve numerous risks and uncertainties  which are described throughout this form k  including under revenue and risk factors within this item the actual results that we achieve may differ materially from any forward looking statements due to these risks and uncertainties 
overview we were incorporated in august and commenced commercial shipments of our principal product  the versant developer suite vds  in since that time  substantially all of our revenue has been derived from primarily sales of licenses for vds  related maintenance and support  training  consulting and nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with vds  and sales of peripheral products for vds 
secondarily the resale of licenses  maintenance  training and consulting for third party products that complement vds 
we currently expect that licenses of vds  versant enjin and peripheral products and sales of associated services will be our principal sources of revenue for the foreseeable future 
in  and  three customers together accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively  however  no single customer represented more than of total revenue in these years 
our future performance will depend in significant part on the continued growth of the e business market and its dependence on highly scalable  high performance and reliable object based technologies such as ours 
the failure of our products to perform favorably in and become an accepted component of these markets  or a slower than expected increase or a decrease in the volume of sales of our products and services to these same markets  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we license our products directly to end users primarily through four types of licenses development licenses  deployment server licenses  deployment client licenses and project licenses which include development and deployment licenses and secondarily through test licenses  high availability licenses and fault tolerant server licenses 
development licenses are sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop an application program that uses vds or versant enjin 
before that customer may deploy an application it has developed under a development license  it must purchase at least one deployment server license and one deployment client license for each computer connected to the server that will run the application using the database management system 
if the customer wishes to install several copies of the application  separate deployment licenses are required for each server computer and each client that will run the particular application 
pricing of vds and versant enjin varies according to several factors  including the computer platform on which the application will run and the number of users that will be able to access the server at any one time 
for certain applications  we offer deployment licenses priced on a per user basis 
we also license our products on a project basis  where the customer simultaneously purchases development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
value added resellers purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis  on terms similar to those of development licenses sold directly to end users 
value added resellers are authorized by us to sublicense deployment copies of vds or versant enjin  together with the value added resellers applications  to end users 
deployment license pricing for sales through value added resellers generally is based either on a percentage of the total price charged by the value added reseller to our end user customers or on a percentage of our list prices 
we also license our products to certain value added resellers on a project basis 
our development  deployment and project license agreements and agreements with value added resellers typically require the payment of a nonrefundable  one time license fee for a license of perpetual term  although certain licenses to value added resellers are for a limited term and or are limited to particular applications 
revenue from perpetual license agreements is recognized upon shipment of the software if there is no significant modification of the software  payment is due within our normal payment terms  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
training and consulting revenue is recognized when a customer s purchase order has been received and the services have been performed 
during  we entered into contracts with certain of our customers that required us to perform development work in return for nonrecurring engineering fees 
revenue related to these non recurring engineering fees was generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
amounts received from customers under certain license  maintenance and nonrecurring engineering agreements involving significant continuing obligations to be performed by us are included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we license vds  versant enjin and peripheral products and sell associated services primarily through our direct sales force to end user customers and value added resellers 
results of operations revenue change change license revenue    as a percentage of total revenue services revenue    as a percentage of total revenue total revenue    total revenue increased from to and from to we continue to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in total revenue and believe this trend will continue in also  see the section below labeled risk factors 
the increase in license revenue from to and from to was attributable to primarily increased sales in the e business market from through  and increased customer deployments of applications previously subject only to development licenses  particularly in the telecommunications market in compared with  and secondarily restructuring and refocusing efforts within our sales force 
we expect license revenue to increase from to in absolute dollar terms  primarily due to increased license purchases by e business customers  as a result of our strategy to capitalize on the e business market opportunity 
we believe  however  that license revenue as a percentage of total revenue will decrease from to due to our plans to grow the consulting organization 
however  due to risks highlighted in risk factors below  license revenue may decrease in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenue from to the increase in services revenue from to was mainly due to our focus in on building a consulting service organization with the resultant increase in consulting revenue partially offset by a decline in maintenance revenue 
the marginal increase in total services revenue from to was due to a increase in maintenance revenues offset by a corresponding decrease in consulting revenues 
the restructuring efforts within the consulting services organization in did not allow us to take advantage of the consulting projects that became available during the year 
we expect that services revenue will increase in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenue from to as we increase our focus on consulting opportunities 
however  due to the risks highlighted in risk factors below  services revenue may not increase in either absolute dollar terms or percentage of total revenue from to we had no customer representing more than of total revenue in or international revenues decreased slightly from million in to million in with a weak euro being a contributor to the variance 
international revenues grew from million in to million in this increase was due to the increases in versant europe s revenues partially offset by revenue decreases in australia and japan 
we intend to maintain our sales and marketing activities outside the united states  including europe  japan and other asia pacific countries  which will require significant management attention and financial resources  and which may increase costs and impact margins unless and until corresponding revenue is achieved 
our international sales are currently denominated predominantly in united states dollars 
an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  less competitive in foreign markets 
we believe that the increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies in did impact our operating results  although not materially 
to the extent that we increase our international sales  our total revenue may be affected to a greater extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower sales levels that typically occur during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world 
international revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in from in due to our increased emphasis on international sales  especially through versant europe  we expect international revenue to increase in absolute dollar terms but decrease as a percentage of total revenue due to the increase in consulting revenues that we expect primarily to occur in the us for however  international revenue may not grow at all and our international operations are subject to corresponding risks  see risk factors risks related to our business we depend on our international operations 
cost of revenue and gross profit change change cost of license revenue    as a percentage of license revenue cost of services revenue    as a percentage of services revenue gross profit    as a percentage of total revenue cost of license revenue consists primarily of reserves for estimated bad debts  product royalty obligations incurred by us when we sublicense tools provided by third parties  royalty obligations incurred by us under a porting services agreement  user manuals  product media  production labor costs  freight and packaging 
cost of license revenue increased in absolute terms from to  primarily due to an increase in royalty costs  but remained constant as a percentage of license revenue 
cost of license revenue decreased from to  primarily due to the elimination of amortization of certain deferred license costs and secondarily due to reduced bad debt reserves and decreases in royalty costs 
as part of the acquisition of versant europe in  we allocated million of the purchase price to deferred license costs 
in  we recognized the remaining million of these deferred license costs as a cost of license revenue 
we expect cost of license revenue in to increase in absolute terms from that in due to increased volume but remain in line with when expressed as a percentage of license revenue 
however  revenue growth in and therefore license revenue margin performance are subject to the risks highlighted in risk factors below 
cost of services revenue consists principally of personnel costs associated with providing consulting  technical support  training and nonrecurring engineering work paid for by customers 
cost of services revenue increased more rapidly than services revenue from to for two reasons 
first  maintenance revenues  which have higher margins than consulting revenues  were a smaller component of the services mix in than in second  we incurred start up costs in the consulting business attributable to hiring and training consultants prior to their being utilized for revenue generation 
the decrease in cost of services revenue from to was primarily due to the restructuring efforts worldwide in decreasing the size of our service organization while refocusing our vision and efforts to better serve our customer base worldwide 
we expect our cost of services revenue will increase from to both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  through headcount and supporting expenses increases 
these increases are necessary to support our projected increases in services revenues and to support our increasing efforts in the consulting business  which we intend to expand in the increases in our e business applications have given rise to substantially increased opportunities to support our customer base more effectively by offering additional consulting services  thereby reducing the need for our customers to find and train addition personnel to implement new e business applications 
marketing and sales expenses change change marketing and sales expenses    as a percentage of total revenue marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of marketing and sales personnel costs including sales commissions  recruiting  travel  advertising  public relations  seminars  trade shows  lead generation  product descriptive literature  product management  sales offices  mailings and depreciation expense 
the increase of from to was the result of additional marketing programs 
the substantial decrease from to was primarily the result of our worldwide restructuring efforts and our decision to utilize the marketing program monies more efficiently by reducing duplicate efforts worldwide 
our focus is on worldwide programs versus regional programs  hence promoting a consistent message to our current and potential customer base 
we expect marketing and sales expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms  due to increased efforts to market our products to the e business market but to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue in however  if we increase our marketing and sales expenditures without corresponding increases in revenue  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
research and development expenses change change research and development expenses   as a percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  recruiting and other personnel related expenses  the costs of quality programs  depreciation or expensing of development equipment  supplies and travel 
the decrease from to resulted from domestic research and development headcount being a smaller component of overall headquarters headcount  resulting in a lower facilities allocation  and from higher percent of employees being located in india  where we enjoy more favorable labor rates 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from reduced compensation and other personnel expenses due to decreases in headcount and secondarily from reduced operating expenses associated with soft mountain s engineering activity 
we believe that a significant level of research and development expenditures is required to remain competitive and complete products under development 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development to design  produce and increase the quality  competitiveness and acceptance of our products 
due to our restructuring activities  we reduced research and development expense in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of revenues in due to our e business efforts as well as ongoing improvements in our vds products  we expect research and development expenses to increase from to in absolute dollars and remain constant as a percentage of revenues 
however  if we continue our research and development efforts without corresponding increases in revenue  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
to date  all research and development expenditures have been expensed as incurred 
general and administrative expenses change change general and administrative expenses   as a percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  recruiting and other personnel related expenses for our accounting  human resources  legal and general management functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include outside legal  audit and public reporting costs  as well as legal  accounting and sales tax accruals 
the decrease from to resulted from lower legal  accounting and sales tax accruals 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to were primarily due to the restructuring efforts taken in and secondarily due to the continuing expense controls used to properly match expense trends with revenue trends 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms but remain constant as a percentage of revenues from to this anticipated increase is due to the need to rebuild part of the administrative staff and infrastructure that were reduced in however  if we increase our existing administration infrastructure without corresponding increases in revenue  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
amortization of goodwill the acquisition of versant europe in march resulted in our recording goodwill representing the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in the amount of million  which is being amortized over a seven year period 
we amortized  of this amount in during and  we amortized  and  respectively  of this amount 
additionally  in we wrote down the versant europe goodwill by million due to our revised estimated discounted cash flow over the next five years 
we will amortize  of this remaining goodwill amount in see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition of soft mountain in september resulted in our writing off  of in process research and development expenses associated with the purchased software and recording goodwill representing the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in the amount of million  which is being amortized over a five year period 
during  we amortized  of this amount 
we will amortize  of this amount in see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
other income expense  net change change other income expense  net as a percentage of total revenue other income expense  net represents the interest expense associated with our financing activities offset to some extent by income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the foreign currency gain loss as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currency other than local currency 
the decrease in interest expense from to and the increase from to was due to the conversion of the vertex convertible note to equity and the subsequent write off of the remaining capitalized note discount of  as a non cash interest expense and  of accrued interest expense which was converted to equity in association with the vertex convertible note during see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes change change provision for income taxes    as a percentage of income loss before income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in and  resulting in no federal or state tax liability based on income 
however  we did incur foreign withholding taxes of  and  in and  respectively  which are included within the income tax provision 
in addition  we made payments of  in that were the result of estimated federal and state income tax due to using the alternative minimum tax method 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million and tax credit carryforwards of million expiring on various dates through due to our history of operating losses through and in  and and other factors  we believe that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of these carryforwards  and therefore a valuation allowance of approximately million has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefit available to us based on actual and forecasted operating results 
due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  the availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset federal taxable income in future periods is subject to an annual limitation due to changes in ownership for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources change change net cash used in operating activities    year end cash  cash equivalents and short term investments    year end working capital deficit  n a  n a in  net cash of  was used in operating activities with net income as increased by depreciation and amortization being offset primarily by increases in accounts receivable  due to the granting of extended payment terms for certain qualified customers 
in  a net loss  increases in accounts receivable  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were partially offset by non cash statement of operations items  decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets resulting in net cash of  being used in operating activities 
in  net cash of million was used in operating activities primarily due to the cash component of our net loss for  decreases in deferred revenue  accrued liabilities and taxes and a decreased provision for doubtful accounts  which were offset by a significant decrease in accounts receivable  decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and increases in accounts payable 
in  net cash used in investing activities was  all for the purchase of equipment needed to support our growth 
in  net cash used in investing activities was  due to  of investment in versant india and purchases of  of property and equipment  primarily for the acquisition of network and computer equipment  associated with yk improvements 
in we purchased million of property and equipment  primarily for the acquisition of network and computer equipment  leasehold improvements  furnishings and fixtures for our headquarters 
in addition  in september  we acquired soft mountain and paid the shareholders of soft mountain  in cash in addition to issuing them  shares of our common stock 
these uses of cash for investing activities were entirely offset by net sales and maturities of short term investments 
in  financing activities provided a net increase in cash of million  primarily due to proceeds from exercising of warrants to purchase common stock and secondarily from the sale of common stock to our employees under employee benefit plans 
these increases were offset by the paydown of our short term bank borrowings  plus the normal principal payments made under capital lease obligations 
in  financing activities provided a net increase of  primarily due to proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and warrants to certain of our largest shareholders and the exercising of warrants and secondarily due to the sale of common stock to our employees under employee benefit plans 
these increases were offset by the paydown of our short term and long term bank borrowings  plus the normal principal payments made under capital lease obligations 
in  financing activities provided million  primarily due to proceeds from the sale of a convertible secured subordinated promissory note  the sale of common stock to certain of our largest shareholders  the sale of common stock to our employees under employee benefit plans and borrowings under a short term accounts receivable loan 
these increases were partially offset by principal payments made under capital lease obligations and our long term bank note 
at december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately million 
we maintain a revolving credit line with a bank that expires on june  the maximum amount that can be borrowed under the revolving credit line is million 
as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding 
borrowings and the standby letter of credit under the revolving credit line are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
these borrowings bear interest at the bank s base lending rate at december  plus 
the loan agreement contains certain financial covenants  which were renegotiated in march in relation to the year ending december  and also prohibits cash dividends and mergers and acquisitions without the bank s prior approval 
at december  we were in compliance with the new covenants 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and lines of credit  and any net cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for in our existing business 
at december   our commitments for capital expenditures were not material 
however there can be no assurance of this and we are dependent upon future events  including our ability to successfully renew our current revolving credit line or obtain additional debt or equity financing  if financial results fall short of our goals 
additional debt or equity financing  may be required  and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
even if we were able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  the terms of this financing may significantly restrict our business activities 
cash may also be needed to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies and we expect that in the event of such an acquisition or investment we will need to seek additional debt or equity financing 
the actual cash resources required to successfully implement our business plan in year will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to those described in the following risk factors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires companies to value derivative financial instruments  including those used for hedging foreign currency exposures  at current market value with the impact of any change in market value being charged against earnings in each period 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
to defer the effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after june  to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instrument contracts and does not currently engage in any hedging activities 
thus  the company anticipates that sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operation or financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
the company adopted sab in the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued financial standards board interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb no 
fin 
fin addresses the application of apb no 
to clarify  among other issues  a the definition of employees for apb no 
purposes  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
the matters set forth below should be carefully considered when evaluating our business and prospects 
risks related to our business we have limited working capital 
at december   we had million of working capital and million of cash and cash equivalents 
to date  we have not achieved profitability or positive cash flow on a sustained basis 
while we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and lines of credit  and any net cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for in our existing business  as our revenue is unpredictable and a significant portion of our expenses are fixed  a revenue shortfall could deplete our limited financial resources and require us to reduce operations substantially or to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately  of bank term debt financing outstanding  of which  a month is due and payable  and another million of bank revolving line debt which is due as we collect from our customers 
from time to time  we have been in violation of covenants of our bank debt 
we will need to generate sufficient earnings to repay this debt when due  or raise additional funds through debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance any equity or debt funding would be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution to our shareholders 
our revenue levels are unpredictable 
our revenue has fluctuated dramatically on a quarterly basis  and we expect this trend to continue 
these dramatic fluctuations result from a number of factors  including the lengthy and highly consultative sales cycle associated with our products  uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of customer deployment schedules of applications based on vds and versant enjin  fluctuations in domestic and foreign demand for our products and services  particularly in the e business  telecommunications and financial services markets  the impact of new product introductions by us and our competitors  our unwillingness to lower prices significantly to meet prices set by our competitors  the effect of publications of opinions about us and our competitors and their products  customer order deferrals in anticipation of product enhancements or new product offerings by us or our competitors  and potential customers unwillingness to invest in our products given our financial instability 
a number of other factors make it impossible to predict our operating results for any period 
we ship our software to a customer upon receipt of the customer s order  and consequently we have little order backlog 
as a result  license revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  we have recorded most of our revenue and booked most of our orders in the third month of each quarter  with a concentration of revenue and orders in the last few days of the quarter 
we expect this trend to continue 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we rely on our core markets  specifically the telecommunications and financial services markets  which are characterized by complexity and intense competition 
historically  we have been highly dependent upon the telecommunications industry  and we are becoming increasingly dependent upon the financial services market for sales of vds 
our success in these areas is dependent  to a large extent  on general economic conditions  our ability to compete with alternative technology providers and whether our customers and potential customers believe we have the expertise and financial stability necessary to provide effective solutions in these markets 
if these conditions  among others  are not satisfied  we may not be successful in generating additional opportunities in these markets 
currently  companies in these markets are scaling back their technology expenditures significantly 
the types of applications and commercial products for the telecommunications and financial services markets are continuing to develop and are rapidly changing  and the market is characterized by an increasing number of new entrants whose products may compete with those of ours 
as a result  we cannot predict the future growth of these markets  and demand for object oriented databases in these markets may not develop or be sustainable 
we also may not be successful in attaining a significant share of these markets 
in addition  organizations in these markets generally develop sophisticated and complex applications that require substantial consulting expertise to implement and optimize 
this requires that we maintain a highly skilled consulting practice with specific expertise in these markets 
there can be no assurance that we can adequately hire and retain personnel for such practice 
we are repositioning our company to address a new marketplace 
up to now the majority of our revenues has been generated by vds in the core markets referred to above 
however  we expect that future revenue growth will be generated mainly by our versant enjin product  which has been developed to improve the performance of application servers in e business applications for both large scale enterprises and for internet based companies such as portals  e marketplaces and bb vendors 
our success in this marketplace depends on the continued growth of the application server market  this market s acceptance of versant enjin and our ability to deliver a reliable  competitively priced product  none of which is assured 
we may not be able to manage costs given the unpredictability of our revenue 
we expended significant resources in and to build our infrastructure and hire personnel  particularly in our services and sales and marketing groups 
we currently expect to continue to hire personnel in in order to support anticipated higher revenue levels 
consequently  we will continue to incur a relatively high level of fixed expenses 
if planned revenue growth does not materialize  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed 
our products have a lengthy sales cycle 
our sales cycle  which varies substantially from customer to customer  often exceeds nine months and can sometimes extend to a year or more in our core business  although sales to our e business customers are often concluded in shorter time intervals 
due in part to the strategic nature of our products and associated expenditures  potential customers are typically cautious in making product acquisition decisions 
the decision to license our products generally requires us to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products  and we must frequently commit no fee pre sales support resources  such as assistance in performing benchmarking and application prototype development 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the relatively large average dollar size of individual licenses  a lost or delayed sale could have a significant impact on our operating results for a particular period 
our customer concentration increases the potential volatility of our operating results 
notwithstanding our recent efforts to develop new customers  typically through the use of relatively lower priced license sales  a significant portion of our total revenue has been  and we believe will continue to be  derived from a limited number of orders placed by large organizations 
the timing of these orders and their fulfillment has caused  and in the future is likely to cause material fluctuations in our operating results  particularly on a quarterly basis 
in addition  our major customers tend to change from year to year 
the loss of any one or more of our major customers or our inability to replace a customer that has become less significant in a given year with a different major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on our international operations 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers located outside the united states 
this requires that we operate internationally and maintain a significant presence in international markets 
however  our international operations are subject to a number of risks 
these risks include longer receivable collection periods  changes in regulatory requirements  dependence on independent resellers  multiple and conflicting regulations and technology standards  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  foreign exchange fluctuations  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  the impact of business cycles and economic instability outside the united states  and limited ability to enforce agreements  intellectual property rights and other rights in some foreign countries 
we must defend against litigation 
we and certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants in four class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  on january   february   march  and march  on june   a consolidated amended complaint was filed by the court appointed lead plaintiff 
on may   the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint  permitting plaintiffs leave to amend 
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on july  like its predecessors  the second amended complaint alleged violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act  and securities and exchange commission rule b promulgated under the securities exchange act  in connection with public statements about us and our financial performance 
the second amended complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages 
we vigorously deny the plaintiffs claims and filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint 
the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was heard by the court on december  and as of this date  the court has not yet issued a decision 
securities litigation can be expensive to defend  consume significant amounts of management time and result in adverse judgments or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
on january   we gave days written notice to buzzeo  inc  one of our customers  informing buzzeo inc 
that it was in default of a promissory note in favor of versant dated january  and a value added reseller agreement between the parties dated june  the agreement 
we also demanded final payment of the promissory note in the amount of  and informed buzzeo inc of our intention to pursue legal action in the event of non payment 
on february   buzzeo  inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of arizona against us  seeking damages based on an alleged breach of contract  implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the warranty under the agreement  plus interest and costs 
on february   we filed a motion to dismiss 
on february   we filed an answer and counterclaim seeking payment under the promissory note and the agreement  of  plus interest and costs 
on march   we filed a motion for summary judgment on both the counterclaim and the complaint 
on august   the court denied the motion to dismiss finding the argument more appropriately addressed in the context of the motion for summary judgment 
we submitted a motion for summary judgement to the court for consideration on february th  on march   the court granted the motion as to liability only on the promissory note and denied the motion as to the amount due under the promissory note and in all other respects 
the motion to strike was denied 
initial disclosures under discovery are required within days of the order and all discovery is required to be completed within six months of the initial discovery disclosures 
our stock price is volatile 
our revenue  operating results and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we have previously experienced significant shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which has had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock and resulted in litigation 
this may occur again in the future 
additionally  as a significant portion of our revenue often occurs late in the quarter  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in the quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
stock ownership has become more concentrated and is subject to dilution 
as a result of the vertex note conversion and equity financing in july  ownership of our equity has become more concentrated 
based on vertex s filings with the sec and assuming  as of december    shares outstanding including conversion of all outstanding preferred stock and exercise of all outstanding warrants  vertex and its affiliates would own approximately of our common stock 
we have registered  shares issuable upon conversion exercise of the outstanding preferred stock and warrants 
the issuance of these shares would result in the dilution of other shareholders  and the sale of these shares could depress the market price of our stock 
risks related to our industry we face competition in both our core business market and the e business market 
in our core business  we compete with companies offering object and relational database management systems 
object oriented competitors include excelon formerly object design  inc  informix and its illustra information technologies  inc subsidiary  objectivity  inc 
and poet software corporation 
in addition  our products compete with traditional relational database management systems such as those from oracle  sybase  informix  ibm and microsoft 
in the e business market our competitors can be classified into two groups 
firstly  we compete with relational database companies  many of which have modified or are expected to modify their rdbm s to incorporate object oriented interfaces and other functionality and which argue this object relational functionality is an adequate solution for integration with application servers 
secondly we face competition from object oriented companies that provide components similar to those included in our enjin product offering  for example excelon  persistence software and toplink 
in order for our products to be well accepted in this marketplace  it is important for one or more of our technical partnerships with application server vendors such as ibm and bea to become strategic on both sides 
many of our competitors  and especially oracle and computer associates  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  service and other resources  significantly greater name recognition  broader product offerings and a larger installed base of customers than ours 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with current and potential customers of ours 
our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  may have more direct access to corporate decision makers based on previous relationships and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on successful technology development 
we believe that significant research and development expenditures will be necessary to remain competitive 
while we believe our research and development expenditures will improve our product lines  due to the uncertainty of software development projects  these expenditures will not necessarily result in successful product introductions 
uncertainties affecting the success of software development project introductions include technical difficulties  market conditions  competitive products and consumer acceptance of new products and operating systems 
we also face certain challenges in integrating third party technology with our products 
these challenges include the technological challenges of integration  which may result in development delays  and uncertainty regarding the economic terms of our relationship with the third party technology provider  which may result in delays of the commercial release of new products 
we have developed technology that will allow versant enjin to support bea weblogic  ibm websphere and other ejb based application servers  however  undiscovered bugs or errors may exist that prevent us from achieving the functionality we seek with such integrations 
in addition  because java bean containers are specific to each application server vendor and no standards have been adopted for these containers  we may not be able to take advantage of our existing development work when propagating our solution for other application server vendors 
we must protect our intellectual property 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products  obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary or use or make copies of our products in violation of license agreements 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of many jurisdictions do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
shrink wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions  and copyright and trade secret protection for software may be unavailable in certain foreign countries 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
to date  we have not been notified that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  but third parties could claim that our current or future products infringe such rights 
we expect that developers of object oriented technology will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products  competitors and patents in our industry segment grows 
any claim of this type  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to integrate our products with those of vendors providing complementary products 
versant vds and enjin must be integrated with compilers  development tools  operating systems and other software and hardware components to produce a complete end user solution 
we may not receive the support of these third party vendors  some of which may compete with us  in integrating our products with their products 
we depend on our personnel for whom competition is intense 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  train and motivate highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  especially in silicon valley where our headquarters are located  and we may not be able to attract  train and motivate such personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues and operating expenses have not been material 
operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated primarily in local currencies 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes
