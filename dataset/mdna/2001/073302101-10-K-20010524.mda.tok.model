item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the world s largest manufacturer of cabin interior products for commercial and general aviation aircraft and for business jets 
we serve virtually all major airlines and a wide variety of general aviation customers and airframe manufacturers 
we believe that we have achieved leading global market positions in each of our major product categories  which include o commercial aircraft seats  including an extensive line of first class  business class  tourist class and commuter aircraft seats  o a full line of airline food and beverage preparation and storage equipment  including coffeemakers  water boilers  beverage containers  refrigerators  freezers  chillers and ovens  o both chemical and gaseous commercial aircraft oxygen delivery systems  and o business jet and general aviation interior products  including an extensive line of executive aircraft seats  indirect overhead lighting systems  oxygen  safety and air valve products 
in addition  we design  develop and manufacture a broad range of cabin interior structures such as galleys and crew rests  and provide comprehensive aircraft cabin interior reconfiguration and passenger to freighter conversion engineering services and related component kits 
our revenues are generally derived from two primary sources refurbishment or upgrade programs for the existing worldwide fleets of commercial and general aviation aircraft and new aircraft deliveries 
we believe our large installed base of products  estimated to be approximately billion as of february  valued at replacement prices  gives us a significant advantage over our competitors in obtaining orders both for spare parts and for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
we have substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of our business as a result of a number of acquisitions 
since  we have completed acquisitions  including four acquisitions during fiscal  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in order to position ourselves as the preferred global supplier to our customers 
during the period from to  we acquired nine commercial aircraft cabin interior products manufacturers for approximately million 
through these acquisitions we built worldwide market leadership positions and became the number one manufacturer for a large number of product offerings 
at the same time  we rationalized our businesses and began re engineering our operations 
we integrated the acquisitions by eliminating operating facilities and consolidating personnel at the acquired businesses  resulting in headcount reductions of approximately  employees through january during fiscal we completed six acquisitions for approximately million 
through these acquisitions we extended our product offerings into oxygen systems and we entered three new markets 
these markets include the structural reconfiguration of passenger cabins  the conversion of passenger aircraft to freighters and the business jet cabin interiors market 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we launched a series of initiatives directed towards expanding our profit margins by consolidating these operations  improving productivity  reducing costs and inventory levels and speeding production of finished products 
these actions included eliminating seven principal facilities  reducing our employment base by over  employees during fiscal and rationalizing our product offerings 
the plan also included initiatives to install company wide information technology and engineering design systems and implement lean manufacturing techniques in our remaining factories 
we recognized a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million to provide for the entire amount of the restructuring  along with costs associated with new product introductions  all of which was charged to cost of sales 
during fiscal  we restructured our seating products operations and decided to discontinue certain product and service offerings 
this product line rationalization eliminated two additional facilities bringing the total number of facilities down to from it also resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately the total cost of this product and service line rationalization was approximately million 
all of the aforementioned initiatives to integrate  rationalize and restructure the businesses acquired prior to fiscal had an aggregate cost of approximately million and have already been expensed and paid for 
these initiatives enabled us to eliminate facilities and reduce headcount by over  employees 
we believe these initiatives will enable us to substantially expand profit margins  strengthen the global business management focus on our core product categories  achieve a more effective leveraging of our resources and improve our ability to rapidly react to changing business conditions 
in conjunction with these efforts  we have also implemented a company wide information technology system  a company wide engineering system and initiated lean manufacturing techniques in our remaining facilities 
common management information and engineering systems and lean manufacturing processes across all operations  coupled with a rationalized product offering are expected to provide us with the ongoing benefit of a generally lower cost structure  and expanding gross and operating margins 
we accomplished a number of initiatives during fiscal  which  together with the actions taken above and the strategic acquisitions discussed below  should positively impact our future performance and help us achieve  we believe  based on our current expectations  higher sales and operating earnings in fiscal as compared to fiscal effective february  we completed the acquisition of four companies that specialize in manufacturing precision machined components and assemblies for the aerospace industry 
we acquired these businesses  alson industries  inc  tl windust machine  inc 
dmgi  inc 
and maynard precision  inc  by issuing to the former stockholders a total of approximately million shares of our common stock  paying them a total of million in cash and assuming or repaying indebtedness of the acquired companies totaling approximately million 
this consideration represents an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the aggregate purchase price includes approximately million of consideration  for which  shares of our common stock was funded into an escrow account 
the payment of the approximately million is contingent upon the business of one of the companies achieving specified operating targets during the year ending february any proceeds from the sale of these shares in excess of the earned incentive will be paid to us 
each of these transactions has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
during fiscal  through may   we completed the acquisition of one additional company  nelson aero space inc  which is involved in the manufacture and distribution of fittings for the aerospace industry  for approximately million in cash 
beginning in  the airlines experienced a turnaround in operating results  leading the domestic airline industry to a period of strong aggregate operating earnings 
airline company balance sheets were substantially strengthened and their liquidity enhanced as a result of this profitability  debt and equity financings and closely managed fleet expansion 
since  however  increases in fuel prices  the softening of the global economy and labor unrest have negatively impacted airline profitability 
during the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal  our seating operations negatively impacted our operating results 
the operating inefficiencies resulted in delayed deliveries to customers  increased re work of seating products  claims for warranty  penalties  out of sequence charges  substantial increases in air freight and other expedite related costs 
penalties and out of sequence charges were imposed by our customers and the airframe manufacturers as a result of our late deliveries as provided for under the terms of our various contracts with these parties 
these problems also resulted in certain airlines diverting seating programs to other manufacturers and the deferrals of other seating programs 
we believe we have now resolved the problems we encountered in our seating operations 
new product development is a strategic tool for our company 
our customers regularly request that we engage in new product development and enhancement activities 
we believe that these activities  if properly focused and managed  will protect and enhance our leadership position 
engineering  research and development spending as a percentage of sales have been approximately for the past several years  and is expected to remain at that level for the foreseeable future 
we also believe in providing our businesses with the tools required to remain competitive 
in that regard  we have  and will continue to invest in property and equipment that enhances our productivity 
over the past several years  annual capital expenditures  exclusive of our new information technology system  were approximately million 
going forward and taking into consideration the recent acquisitions  we expect that annual capital expenditures will be approximately million 
all dollar amounts in the following discussion and analysis are presented in thousands of dollars  except per share amounts 
year ended february  compared with year ended february  net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  or as compared to the prior year 
the year over year decrease in sales is primarily attributable to lower shipments of seating products and galley structures  as well as decisions made in the prior year to discontinue certain low margin products and services 
the decreased sales of seating and galley structures are consistent with the reduction in new aircraft deliveries in calendar as compared to calendar  and also reflect last year s problems in our seating business  which have since been resolved 
our backlog was approximately  as of february  our backlog at the end of the prior year was approximately  backlog increased substantially in the last six months of fiscal  from a fiscal low of about million as of august the higher backlog since august reflects organic growth of and overall growth of over the six month period 
approximately  or  of our backlog at february is deliverable by the end of fiscal improved gross and operating profit margins were key contributors to b e s improved financial performance for fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit was  of net sales for fiscal gross profit was  higher than fiscal gross profit of  of net sales  reflecting a gross margin improvement of  basis points compared to fiscal the previous year s gross margin was adversely impacted by manufacturing problems in the seating operations 
the current year s gross margin improvement was due to two principal factors the turnaround in our seating business and the success of our continuous improvement initiatives 
aided by our information technology investments  these initiatives are enabling us to substantially improve both quality and productivity and reduce costs  particularly in our manufacturing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  of net sales for fiscal  which was  less than the prior year amount of  of net sales 
research  development and engineering expenses were  of net sales for fiscal  a decrease of  compared to  of net sales for the previous year 
the decrease is primarily due to substantially lower spending in our seating and galley operations 
amortization expense for fiscal was  of net sales as compared to  of net sales in the prior year 
operating earnings were  of net sales for fiscal  excluding  of costs related to the four recent acquisitions and the termination of advanced thermal sciences a wholly owned subsidiary initial public offering 
including such costs  operating earnings were  of net sales during fiscal  as compared to  of net sales in the prior year 
interest expense  net was  during fiscal  or  greater than interest expense of  for the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on the company s bank borrowings 
earnings before income taxes in the current year were  excluding the acquisition related and ipo costs 
including such costs  earnings before income taxes were  for fiscal compared to a loss of  in the previous year 
income tax expense for fiscal was  as compared to  in the prior year 
b e s net earnings for fiscal were  excluding the acquisition related and ipo costs 
including such costs  net earnings were  or per share basic and diluted  as compared to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted in the previous year 
year ended february  compared to year ended february  net sales for fiscal were  an increase of approximately  or over the prior year 
organic revenue growth  exclusive of revenues from our in flight entertainment business  in fiscal and fiscal was approximately and  respectively  whereas revenue growth on a pro forma basis for fiscal and  giving effect to our acquisitions in fiscal and excluding revenues from our in flight entertainment business for both periods  was approximately in and in our backlog was approximately  as of february  and approximately  as of february  during the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal  our operating results were negatively impacted by our seating operations 
these operating problems resulted in delayed deliveries to customers  increased re work of seating products  claims for warranty  penalties  out of sequence charges  substantial increases in air freight and other expedite related costs 
late customer deliveries resulted in certain airlines diverting seating programs to other manufacturers and the deferral of other seating programs 
we have now resolved the operating problems in our seating business 
gross profit for fiscal was  gross profit for fiscal before the special costs and charges described below was  of net sales 
this was less than the prior year of  calculated on a comparable basis  which represented of net sales 
the decrease in gross profit before special costs and charges is primarily attributable to the mix of products sold during the year 
during fiscal  we incurred  of costs in our seating operations associated with claims for penalties  out of sequence charges  warranties and substantial increases in air freight and other expedite related costs 
in addition  we incurred approximately  of manufacturing and engineering inefficiencies  of which  has been included as a component of cost of sales   has been included as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses and  has been included as a component of research  development and engineering expenses 
also  during fiscal  we completed a review of our businesses and decided to discontinue certain product and service offerings 
this product line rationalization will reduce the number of facilities by two and is expected to result in a headcount reduction of approximately the total cost of this product and service line rationalization was  approximately  of the rationalization costs are included in cost of sales  with the balance of  charged to operating expenses 
the aggregate impact of these operating inefficiencies  penalties  and product line rationalization costs was to increase cost of sales and operating expenses by  during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  of net sales for fiscal  which was  or  greater than the comparable period in the prior year of  of net sales 
severance and other facility consolidation costs associated with the charges described above  together with increased operating expenses at our seating products operations and increased management information system training costs and related expenses were the principal reasons for the increase 
research  development and engineering expenses were  of net sales during fiscal  a decrease of  over the prior year 
amortization expense for fiscal of  was  greater than the amount recorded in the prior year  and is due to our acquisitions in a portion of the purchase price for our acquisitions in was allocated to purchased in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of  for the write off of acquired in process research and development and other acquisition related expenses 
we generated operating earnings of  of net sales during fiscal  as compared to an operating loss of  in the prior year 
equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiary of  represents our share of the losses generated by sextant in flight systems through october   at which time we sold our remaining interest 
interest expense  net was  during fiscal  or  greater than interest expense of  for the prior year  and is due to the increase in our long term debt used  in part  to finance our acquisitions in the loss before income taxes in the current year was  which includes  of costs and charges primarily related to our seating products operations as compared to the loss before income taxes in the prior year of  which includes restructuring and new product introduction costs of  acquisition related expenses of  and the transaction gain of 
earnings before income taxes excluding the above mentioned costs and expenses were  for fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
income tax expense for fiscal was  as compared to  in the prior year 
the net loss for fiscal was  or per share basic and diluted  as compared to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs  on going capital expenditures and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness 
our primary requirements for working capital have been related to the reduction of accrued liabilities  including interest  accrued penalties incurred in connection with the fiscal seating manufacturing problems  incentive compensation  warranty obligations and accrued severance 
our working capital was  as of february   as compared to  as of february  and  as of february  at february   our cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  at february  cash provided from operating activities was  for fiscal and was  for fiscal for the fiscal year ended february   accounts receivable decreased over the prior fiscal year balance  while sales increased over the prior fiscal year level 
during fiscal and  we completed significant corporate wide improvements in our billing and collection processes 
we believe these are the primary reasons for the reduction in accounts receivable at the end of fiscal and based on these factors and the current economic conditions in our industry  we currently do not expect to significantly adjust our bad debt reserves  although this could change in the future should conditions change 
the primary source of cash during fiscal was net earnings  depreciation and amortization of  other non cash expenses of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  a decrease in other current assets of  offset by a use of cash for inventories of  and payables and accruals of  during fiscal  the provision for excess and obsolete inventories increased by an incremental  which was partially offset by a  decrease in accrued warranties related to a favorable resolution of a customer s claim 
we hold a promissory note from thomson csf holding corporation  a subsidiary of the thales group a publicly traded french company with over  in sales 
we are currently involved in a dispute with thales over certain terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
thomson csf holding corporation failed to make a  payment when due in october these obligations to us are guaranteed by thomson csf sextant  inc we have initiated arbitration against thales and thomson and expect that this matter will be resolved during fiscal our capital expenditures were  and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the year over year decrease in capital expenditures is primarily attributable to significant expenditures in the prior year for management information system enhancements  expenditures for plant modernization and for acquisitions completed during fiscal we anticipate on going annual capital expenditures of approximately  for the next several years 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have  in the past  generally funded our capital expenditures from cash from operations and funds available to us under our bank credit facility 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on hand and from operations and  if we are able to refinance our bank credit facility  funds available to us under such new facility 
in addition  since  we have completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of  we have financed these acquisitions primarily through issuances of debt and equity securities  including our notes  our notes and our notes 
included in these acquisitions were the four businesses recently acquired and effective as of february  we acquired alson industries  inc  tl windust machine  inc  dmgi  inc 
and maynard precision  inc 
by issuing to the former stockholders a total of approximately million shares of our common stock  paying them a total of approximately  in cash and assuming or repaying indebtedness of the acquired companies totaling approximately  of these funds   were obtained from our bank credit facility  which has since been repaid and terminated as described below  and the balance came from our cash on hand 
this consideration represents an aggregate purchase price of approximately  the aggregate purchase price includes  of consideration  represented by  shares of our common stock  that were funded into an escrow account 
the payment of this consideration is contingent upon the business of one of the companies  tl windust  achieving specified operating targets during the year ending february the sellers of tl windust have the opportunity to receive additional purchase price considerations up to a limit of  the additional funds are due based upon a calculation of tl windust s sales and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  for fiscal year exceeding a minimum threshold 
if tl windust s ebitda exceeds  the full  is due and payable 
if a lower amount is earned  only a portion of the  is due and payable 
any proceeds from the sale of these escrow shares in excess of the earnings incentive of approximately  will be paid to us 
each of these transactions has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the terms of the acquisition agreements for the acquired businesses provide certain registration rights and together provide that the former stockholders of the companies we acquired will receive net proceeds from the resale of their million shares equal to a total of approximately  any proceeds in excess of the approximately  will be for our benefit and if the net proceeds to the former stockholders are less than approximately  we will pay the former stockholders the difference from our available funds 
in the event that the shares are not sold within days of the closing of the acquisitions  we are obligated to repurchase these shares and pay approximately  in cash to the former stockholders 
we may also repurchase these shares at any time from the former stockholders for an amount equal to approximately  in cash 
on april  we sold million of senior subordinated notes due in a private offering 
the net proceeds less estimated debt issue costs received by us from the sale of the notes were approximately million 
approximately million of proceeds were or will be used to redeem our senior subordinated notes due and approximately million of proceeds were used to repay balances outstanding under our bank credit facility  which was then terminated 
the remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  including potential future acquisitions 
we repaid and cancelled our bank facility on april  upon the settlement of the sale of the million of senior subordinated notes in our recent debt offering 
we intend to replace our existing bank credit facility with a new credit facility as soon as reasonably practicable 
we are currently in the process of arranging a new bank credit facility 
when the credit agreement becomes effective  we do not expect to immediately incur any additional debt 
on april  we called for redemption of all our senior subordinated notes on may  we will redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to percent of the principal amount  together with the accrued interest to the redemption date 
we deposited with the trustee on april  funds in an amount sufficient to redeem the senior subordinated notes on the redemption date 
upon deposit of these funds  the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes was discharged 
long term debt consists principally of our newly issued senior subordinated notes  our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes 
the  of notes mature on may   the  of notes mature on march  and the  of notes mature on november  the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness 
each of the notes  notes and notes contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on future indebtedness  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  liens  dividends  mergers and transfers of assets  all of which were met by us as of february  the maturities of our long term debt  on a pro forma basis showing the effect of our recent debt offering  are as follows year ending february  thereafter  total  b e aerospace uk limited  one of our subsidiaries  has a revolving line of credit agreement aggregating approximately million 
this credit agreement is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory of b e aerospace uk limited and guaranteed by us 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of february  inventum  another of our subsidiaries  has a revolving line of credit agreement for approximately million 
this credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of inventum 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of february  we believe that the cash flow from operations and the net proceeds of our recent debt offering will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that we will be able to replace our bank credit facility  which was recently terminated  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
our ability to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures  make scheduled payments and refinance our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which  in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
deferred tax assets we established a valuation allowance related to the utilization of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainties that preclude us from determining that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate taxable income to realize such assets during the federal operating loss carryforward period  which begins to expire in these uncertainties include recent cumulative losses incurred by us  the highly cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate  economic conditions in asia which has impacted the airframe manufacturers and the airlines  the impact of rising fuel prices on our airline customers  the impact of labor disputes involving our airline customers  our high degree of financial leverage  risks associated with the implementation of our integrated management information system  risks associated with our seat manufacturing operations and risks associated with the integration of acquisitions 
we monitor these uncertainties  as well as other positive and negative factors that may arise in the future  as we assess the necessity for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets

risk factors we are directly dependent upon the conditions in the airline industry and a severe and prolonged downturn could negatively impact our results of operations our principal customers are the world s commercial airlines 
as a result  our business is directly dependent upon the conditions in the highly cyclical and competitive commercial airline industry 
in the late s and early s  the world airline industry suffered a severe downturn  which resulted in record losses and several air carriers seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
as a consequence  during such period  airlines sought to conserve cash by reducing or deferring scheduled cabin interior refurbishment and upgrade programs and by delaying purchases of new aircraft 
this led to a significant contraction in the commercial aircraft cabin interior products industry and a decline in our business and profitability 
since  increases in fuel prices  the softening of the global economy and labor unrest have negatively impacted airline profitability 
a number of airlines have announced that they expect these trends to continue in calendar year should the airline industry suffer a severe and prolonged downturn which adversely affects their profitability  discretionary airline spending  including for new aircraft and cabin interior refurbishments and upgrades  would be more closely monitored or even reduced 
in addition  any prolonged labor unrest experienced by any of our major customers could lead to a delay in their scheduled refurbishment and upgrade programs 
lower capital spending by the airlines or delays in scheduled programs could lead to reduced orders of our products and services and  as a result  our business and profitability could suffer 
our business and profitability have historically been adversely affected by downturns in the airline industry 
our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and will require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service we have substantial indebtedness and  as a result  significant debt service obligations 
as of february   we had approximately  aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding  representing approximately of total capitalization 
as of february   after giving pro forma effect to our recent debt offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom  our indebtedness would have aggregated approximately  including short and long term debt of our subsidiaries of  representing approximately of total capitalization 
we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
we intend to replace our bank credit facility  which we terminated in connection with our recent debt offering  as soon as reasonably practicable 
we have no principal maturities on our outstanding indebtedness prior to other than principal maturities of our subsidiaries aggregating 
our annual debt service payment obligations consisting of cash payments of interest  giving pro forma effect to our recent debt offering  are expected to be approximately  the degree of our leverage and  as a result  significant debt service obligations  could have significant consequences to purchasers or holders of our shares of common stock  including o limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth strategy  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other general corporate requirements  o limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of those funds to fund debt service obligations  o increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  and o if we are able to replace our bank credit facility  increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because borrowings under a new bank credit facility will likely be at variable interest rates 
we may not be able to generate the necessary amount of cash to service our indebtedness  which may require us to refinance our debt  obtain additional financing or sell assets our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations will depend upon  among other things  our future operating performance and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary 
each of these factors is to a large extent dependent on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service obligations  we will need to refinance  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
our business may not generate cash flow  and we may not be able to obtain funding  sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements 
we have significant financial and operating restrictions in our debt instruments that may have an adverse affect on our operations the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain numerous financial and operating covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  including dividend payments and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities 
agreements governing future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions 
we intend to replace our bank credit facility  which was cancelled on april   with a new credit facility as soon as reasonably practicable 
we expect any new credit facility to contain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in any current or future agreements governing our indebtedness  including our indentures  could result in an event of default under our bank credit facilities  or such indentures  which could permit acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we are not certain whether we would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
the airline industry is heavily regulated and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales  or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance  which could reduce our results of operations the federal aviation administration prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components  including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation cabin interior products  and licenses component repair stations within the united states 
comparable agencies  such as the uk civil aviation authority and the japanese civil aviation board  regulate these matters in other countries 
if we fail to obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a license previously granted  the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed 
in addition  designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be both expensive and time consuming 
from time to time the faa proposes new regulations 
these new regulations generally cause an increase in costs to comply with these regulations  when the faa first enacted technical standard order c  all seating companies were required to meet these new rules 
compliance with this rule required industry participants to spend millions of dollars on engineering  plant and equipment to comply with the regulation 
a number of smaller seating companies decided that they did not have the resources  financial or otherwise  to comply with these rules and they either sold their businesses or ceased operations 
to the extent the faa implements rule changes in the future  we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance 
the airline industry is subject to extensive health and environmental regulation  any violation of which could subject us to significant liabilities and penalties we are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards  and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
we may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
in addition  we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities  or at facilities we may acquire 
we compete with a number of established companies  some of which have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies we compete with numerous established companies 
some of these companies  particularly in the passenger to freighter conversion business  have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
our ability to be an effective competitor will depend on our ability to remain the supplier of retrofit and refurbishment products and spare parts on the commercial fleets on which our products are currently in service 
it will also depend on our success in causing our products to be selected for installation in new aircraft  including next generation aircraft  and in avoiding product obsolescence 
our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the rapidly growing passenger to freighter conversion business will depend on our success in being selected to convert specific aircraft  our ability to maintain and enhance our engineering design  our certification and program management capabilities and our ability to effectively use our recent acquisitions to manufacture a broader range of structural components  connectors and fasteners used in this business 
if we are unable to manufacture quality products and to deliver our products on time  we may be subject to increased costs or loss of customers or orders  which could reduce our results of operations during the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal  we experienced significant operating inefficiencies in our seating programs which resulted in delayed deliveries to customers  increased re work of seating products  claims for warranty  penalties  out of sequence charges  substantial increases in air freight and other expedite related costs 
in addition  as a result of our late customer deliveries  certain airlines diverted their seating programs to other manufacturers 
to the extent we suffer any of these inefficiencies or shortcomings in the future we will likely experience significant penalties and loss of customers 
our acquisition strategy may be less successful than we expect and therefore  our growth may be limited we intend to consider future acquisitions 
we intend to consider future strategic acquisitions  some of which could be material to us and which may include companies that are substantially equivalent or larger in size compared to us 
we continually explore and conduct discussions with many third parties regarding possible acquisitions 
as of the date of this prospectus  we have no acquisition agreements to acquire any business or assets 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire attractive companies  to effectively integrate such companies  achieve cost efficiencies and to manage these businesses as part of our company 
we will have to integrate any acquisitions into our business 
the difficulties of combining the operations  technologies and personnel of companies we acquire  including those we acquired effective february   into our company include o coordinating and integrating geographically separated organizations  and o integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds 
we may not be able to effectively manage or integrate the acquired companies 
further  we may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions  increased competition and the loss of certain customers resulting from the acquisitions 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business and the loss of key personnel and customers 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the transition and integration of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop 
we will have to finance any future acquisitions 
depending upon the acquisition opportunities available  we may need to raise additional funds or arrange for additional bank financing 
we may seek such additional funds through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or bank loans 
we also intend to replace our existing bank credit facility with a new facility as soon as reasonably practicable 
issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in substantial dilution to stockholders 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us could have adverse consequences to stockholders as described above 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to make future acquisitions in accordance with our business strategy  to absorb adverse operating results  to fund capital expenditures or to respond to changing business and economic conditions may be adversely affected  all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are risks inherent in international operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations our operations are primarily in the united states  with approximately of our sales during fiscal coming from our foreign operations in the united kingdom and the netherlands 
while the majority of our operations is based domestically  each of our facilities sells to airlines all over the world 
as a result  or more of our consolidated sales for the past three fiscal years were to airlines located outside the united states 
we have direct investments in a number of subsidiaries in foreign countries primarily in europe 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies affect the dollar value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  with these fluctuations being included in a separate component of stockholders equity 
operating results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at average monthly exchange rates 
at february   we reported a cumulative foreign currency translation amount of  in stockholders equity as a result of foreign currency adjustments  and we may incur additional adjustments in future periods 
in addition  the us dollar value of transactions based in foreign currency collections on foreign sales or payments for foreign purchases also fluctuates with exchange rates 
if in the future a substantial majority of our sales were not denominated in the currency of the country of product origin  we could face increased currency risk 
also  changes in the value of the us dollar or other currencies could result in fluctuations in foreign currency translation amounts or the us dollar value of transactions and  as a result  our net earnings could be adversely affected 
our largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in dutch guilders and british pounds 
we may engage in hedging transactions in the future to manage or reduce our foreign exchange risk 
however  our attempts to manage our foreign currency exchange risk may not be successful and  as a result  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our foreign operations could also be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where we operate 
due to our foreign operations we could be subject to such factors in the future and the impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject us to additional costs or loss of sales  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our total assets include substantial intangible assets 
the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets 
at february   intangibles and other assets  net  represent approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and other identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible assets we have acquired since we may not be able to realize the value of these assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
at each balance sheet date  we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of intangible assets 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities of the related business  an impairment is deemed to have occurred 
in this event  the amount is written down accordingly 
under current accounting rules  this would result in a charge of operating earnings 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization  which could be material 
as of february   we have determined that no impairment existed 
risks associated with our capital stock provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our company  even those which the holders of a majority of our common stock may favor our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws o classify the board of directors into three classes  with directors of each class serving for a staggered three year period  o provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the approval of the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of such directors  o require at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to alter  amend or repeal the provisions relating to the classified board and removal of directors described above  o permit the board of directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board  o restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings  and o contain advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
such provisions would make the removal of incumbent directors more difficult and time consuming and may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by the board of directors 
our board of directors has declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding 
a right will also be attached to each share of common stock subsequently issued 
the rights will have certain anti takeover effects 
if triggered  the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires more than of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights could discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or other similar transaction 
under our restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences and rights of any such series without stockholder approval 
the board of directors could  therefore  issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us 
in addition  under certain circumstances  section of the delaware general corporation law makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder  or generally a stockholder  to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three year period 
you may not receive cash dividends on our shares we have never paid a cash dividend and do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and to repay indebtedness 
also  our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock is restricted by covenants in our outstanding notes 
we also intend to replace our bank credit facility with a new credit facility as soon as reasonably practicable 
we expect any new credit facility to contain customary covenants  which may include covenants restricting our ability to declare and pay cash dividends 
if the price of our common stock continues to fluctuate significantly  you could lose all or a part of your investment since the beginning of fiscal  the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases  and decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to o our quarterly operating results  o changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  o changes in our business  o changes in the market s perception of our business  o changes in the businesses  earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors or customers  o changes in general market or economic conditions  and o changes in the legislative or regulatory environment 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies  including companies in our industry 
the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price
