year ended december  compared to the year ended december  operating revenue 
sunrise properties revenues include resident fees from sunrise owned properties  management service revenues from consulting and pre opening services contracts with third parties  and income from the sales of owned communities 
sunrise properties revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  resident fees  including community fees  for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the inclusion for the year ended december  of approximately million of resident fees generated from the operations of the consolidated assisted living facilities open during the year ended december  that were not open during the year ended december  in addition  resident fees of million were included in the year ended december  from properties previously held for sale 
the remaining increase in resident fees was due primarily to a full year of operations for the karrington facilities acquired in may and an increase in the average daily resident rate for facilities that were owned and operated by sunrise during both periods 
average resident occupancy for sunrise s stabilized communities during was compared to for the sunrise communities stabilized during comparing the same store properties for and which excludes the karrington facilities that are now stabilized would have resulted in occupancy of for both years 
sunrise defines stabilized communities as those it has owned and operated for at least months or those that have achieved occupancy percentages of or above at the beginning of the measurement period 
average daily rate for stabilized facilities during was compared to during for the facilities currently owned which were stabilized in both and  average daily rate increased from to the increase is due to the inclusion of additional prototype facilities that have higher basic care rates and a general increase in the basic care rate 
management and contract services revenue decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to a reduction in the number of third party pre opening services contracts in place during each of the respective periods  and the stage of completion on each contract 
there were pre opening services contracts in place during compared to contracts for operating expenses 
sunrise properties operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  facility operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to expenses from operations of the consolidated additional assisted living facilities open during that were not open during in addition  facility operating expenses of million were included in from properties previously held for sale 
the remaining balance of the increase was primarily due to a full year of operations for the karrington facilities acquired in may and an increase in labor and other expenses at facilities that were operational for a full year in both periods 
management and contract services expense represents amounts sunrise properties pays to sunrise management services for management of its wholly owned and majority owned facilities 
management and contract services expense for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties managed during compared to depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in the number of facilities open during that were not open during net interest expense 
net interest expense increased for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  of this million increase  million was due to additional borrowings and an increase in the variable interest rate under sunrise s million credit facility 
the remaining increase is due to an overall increase in average borrowings during compared to and an increase to in the weighted average interest rate on sunrise s variable rate debt for compared to for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  operating revenue 
sunrise properties revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  resident fees  including community fees  for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the inclusion for the year ended december  of approximately million of resident fees generated from the operations of the consolidated assisted living facilities open during that were not open during in addition  approximately million of resident fees were generated by the karrington consolidated facilities from the date of acquisition through the end of the remaining increase in resident fees was due primarily to an increase in the average daily resident rate for facilities that were owned and operated by sunrise during both periods 
average resident occupancy for sunrise s stabilized communities during was compared to for the sunrise communities stabilized during for the stabilized facilities owned and operated in both and  average resident occupancy increased from to 
sunrise defines stabilized communities as those it has owned and operated for at least months or those that have achieved occupancy percentages of or above at the beginning of the measurement period 
average daily rate for stabilized facilities during was compared to during for the stabilized facilities owned and operated in both and  average daily rate increased from to the increase is due to the inclusion of additional prototype facilities that have higher basic care rates and a general increase in the basic care rate 
management and contract services revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in the number of third party pre opening services contracts in place during each of the respective periods  and the stage of completion on each contract 
there were pre opening services contracts in place during the year ended december  compared to contracts for the year ended december  operating expenses 
sunrise properties operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  facility operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to expenses from operations of the consolidated additional assisted living facilities open during the year ended december  that were not open during the same period in in addition  approximately million of operating expenses were generated by the karrington consolidated facilities from the date of acquisition through the end of the remaining balance of the increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and other expenses at facilities that were operational for a full year in both periods 
management and contract services expense for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties managed during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in the number of facilities open during the year ended december  that were not open during the same period in net interest expense 
net interest expense increased for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  of this million increase  million was due to additional borrowings and an increase in the variable interest rate under sunrise s million credit facility 
the remaining increase is due to an overall increase in total debt as of december  compared to december  and an increase to in the weighted average interest rate on sunrise s variable rate debt for compared to for corporate expenses operating expenses 
parent company operating expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel and other infrastructure in anticipation of the continuing growth of the company 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for sunrise was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is due to an increase in pre tax income and an increase in the effective tax rate to for compared to for and for utilization of operations related deferred tax benefits reduced sunrise s federal and state income tax rates in both and realization of the deferred tax asset of million at december  is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
sunrise expects to fully utilize the loss carryforwards prior to expiration 
liquidity and capital resources to date  sunrise has financed its operations from long term borrowings  equity offerings and cash generated from operations 
at december   sunrise had million of outstanding debt at a weighted average interest rate of 
of the amount of outstanding debt  sunrise had million of fixed rate debt  excluding a million loan discount  at a weighted average interest rate of  and million of variable rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of 
increases in prevailing interest rates could increase sunrise s interest payment obligations relating to variable rate debt 
see note to sunrise s consolidated financial statements for a detail of sunrise s outstanding debt at december  sunrise has entered into a swap transaction whereby  effective during the period june  through june   outstanding advances of up to million libor floating rate debt bear interest at a fixed rate based on a fixed libor base rate of 
sunrise recorded net interest expense in  and in the amounts of   and  respectively  for swap transactions 
there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in sunrise s debt instruments  including provisions which require it to meet specified financial tests 
for example  sunrise s million multi property mortgage  which is secured by of its facilities  requires that these facilities maintain a cash flow to interest expense coverage ratio of at least to sunrise s million credit facility requires sunrise to have a consolidated tangible net worth of at least million  to maintain a consolidated minimum cash liquidity balance of at least million and to meet other financial ratios 
these tests are administered on a monthly or quarterly basis  depending on the covenant  require consent for changes in management or control of sunrise 
for example  sunrise s million revolving credit facility requires the lender s consent for any merger where paul klaassen or teresa klaassen does not remain chairman of the board and chief executive officer of sunrise  restrict the ability of sunrise subsidiaries to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or engage in mergers or other business combinations without lender consent  and require that sunrise maintain minimum occupancy levels at its facilities to maintain designated levels of borrowings 
for example  sunrise s million credit facility requires that occupancy be achieved after months for a newly opened facility and  following this month period  be maintained at or above that level 
at december   sunrise had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including million in high quality short term investments a p rated and currently has million of unused lines of credit 
working capital at december  was million  excluding the million multi property mortgage due on may  management anticipates extending the multi property mortgage with the original lender prior to maturity 
excluding this multi property mortgage  working capital decreased million from million at december  primarily due to a reclassification of assets held for sale to property and equipment  a decrease in prepaid and other current assets  and an increase in deferred revenue from property sales 
net cash provided by operating activities for and was approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for reflects the corresponding increase in the number of facilities operated by sunrise at december  versus december during and  sunrise used million and million  respectively  for investing activities 
investing activities included investment in property and equipment in the amounts of million and million  respectively  related to the construction of assisted living facilities  net of sales of facilities 
in  sunrise also invested million to facilitate the development of assisted living facilities with third parties  compared to million in these investing activities were offset by proceeds from the sale of assisted living facilities in amounting to million plus million of proceeds from investments and notes receivable 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
financing activities in and included additional borrowings of million and million  respectively  offset by debt repayments of million and million  respectively 
the reduced level of borrowings and increased level of repayments are partially a result of sunrise s strategy to sell certain assisted living facilities 
the additional borrowings under sunrise s credit facility during and were used to fund sunrise s continued development of assisted living facilities 
sunrise currently estimates that the existing credit facilities  together with existing working capital  proceeds from sales of selected real estate assets as a normal part of its operations  financing commitments and financing expected to be available  will be sufficient to fund facilities currently under construction 
additional financing will  however  be required to complete additional development and to refinance existing indebtedness 
sunrise estimates that it will cost between million and million to complete the facilities sunrise currently has under construction 
sunrise has entered into contracts to purchase and lease additional sites 
the total contracted purchase price of these sites is million 
sunrise estimates that it will cost between million and million to develop these properties 
sunrise expects that the cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund the development sites for these additional properties for at least the next twelve months 
sunrise expects from time to time to seek additional funding through public or private financing sources  including equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing and refinancing will be available on acceptable terms 
the ability of sunrise to achieve its development plans will depend upon a variety of factors  many of which will be outside the control of sunrise 
these factors include obtaining zoning  land use  building  occupancy  licensing and other required governmental permits for the construction of new facilities without experiencing significant delays  completing construction of new facilities on budget and on schedule  the ability to work with third party contractors and subcontractors who construct the facilities  shortages of labor or materials that could delay projects or make them more expensive  adverse weather conditions that could delay projects  finding suitable sites for future development activities at acceptable prices  and addressing changes in laws and regulations or how existing laws and regulations are applied 
sunrise cannot assure that it will not experience delays in completing facilities under construction or in development or that it will be able to identify suitable sites at acceptable prices for future development activities 
if it fails to achieve its development plans  its growth could slow  which would adversely impact its revenues and results of operations 
sunrise s growth plan includes the acquisition of assisted living facilities or companies operating assisted living facilities 
the success of sunrise s acquisitions will be determined by numerous factors  including the sunrise s ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  competition for such acquisitions  the purchase price  the financial performance of the facilities after acquisition and the ability of sunrise to integrate or operate acquired facilities effectively 
any failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on sunrise s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the long term care industry is highly competitive and the assisted living segment is becoming increasingly competitive 
sunrise competes with numerous other companies that provide similar long term care alternatives  such as home health care agencies  facility based service programs  retirement communities  convalescent centers and other assisted living providers 
in general  regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial 
in pursuing its growth strategies  sunrise has experienced and expects to continue to experience increased competition in its efforts to develop and acquire assisted living facilities 
some of the present and potential competitors of sunrise are significantly larger and have  or may obtain  greater financial resources than sunrise 
consequently  sunrise cannot assure that it will not encounter increased competition that could limit its ability to attract residents or expand its business  which could have a material adverse effect on its revenues and earnings 
sunrise expects that the number of owned and operated facilities will continue to increase substantially as it pursues its development and acquisition programs for new assisted living facilities 
this rapid growth will place significant demands on sunrise s management resources 
sunrise s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operational  financial and management information systems and to continue to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees 
if sunrise is unable to manage its growth effectively  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
sunrise believes that some assisted living markets have become or are on the verge of becoming overbuilt 
as described above  regulation and other barriers to entry into the assisted living industry are not substantial 
consequently  the development of new assisted living facilities could outpace demand 
overbuilding in sunrise market areas could  therefore  cause sunrise to experience decreased occupancy  depressed margins or lower operating results 
sunrise believes that each local market is different and sunrise is and will continue to react in a variety of ways  including selective price discounting  to the specific competitive environment that exists in each market 
market risk sunrise is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its notes receivable  investments and debt 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  sunrise has investments in notes receivable and bonds 
investments in notes receivable are primarily with joint venture arrangements in which sunrise has equity ownership percentages ranging from to 
investments in bonds are secured by the operating properties subject to the debt and are with properties that are managed by sunrise 
the majority of the investments have fixed rates 
one of the notes has an adjustable rate 
sunrise utilizes a combination of debt and equity financing to fund its development  construction and acquisition activities 
sunrise seeks the financing at the most favorable terms available at the time 
when seeking debt financing  sunrise uses a combination of variable and fixed rate debt  whichever is more favorable in management s judgment at the time of financing 
sunrise has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rates on some of its long term borrowings 
as of december   sunrise had one interest rate swap agreement that effectively establishes fixed rates of on up to million of long term debt until june sunrise does not utilize forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value of the debt  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
sunrise generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity without penalty 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until sunrise would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance of million at december  constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
the table below details by category the principal amount  the average interest rates and the estimated fair market value 
some of the mortgage loans receivable and some items in the various categories of debt  excluding the convertible debentures  require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to sunrise for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
the fair market value estimate of the convertible notes is based on the market value at december  estimated fair maturity date market dollars in thousands thereafter value assets notes receivable fixed rate     average interest rate variable rate   average interest rate investments bonds   average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate        average interest rate variable rate        average interest rate convertible notes   average interest rate impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no and  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  statement no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments 
sunrise participates in interest rate swap transactions  which would be considered derivatives under statement no 
sunrise has not entered into any other derivative transactions 
because of sunrise s minimal use of derivatives  statement no 
is not anticipated to materially affect results of operations or the financial position of sunrise 
impact of inflation resident fees from owned assisted living facilities and management services income from facilities operated by sunrise for third parties are the primary sources of revenue 
these revenues are affected by daily resident fee rates and facility occupancy rates 
the rates charged for the delivery of assisted living services are highly dependent upon local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the facilities operate 
in addition  employee compensation expense is the principal cost element of property operations 
employee compensation  including salary increases and the hiring of additional staff to support sunrise s growth initiatives  have previously had a negative impact on operating margins and may again do so in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of sunrise s resident agreements are for terms of one year  but are terminable by the resident at any time upon days notice  and allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the daily fees payable  and thus may enable sunrise to seek increases in daily fees due to inflation or other factors 
any increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy of sunrise s facilities 
sunrise believes  however  that the short term nature of its resident agreements generally serves to reduce the risk to sunrise of the adverse effect of inflation 
there can be no assurance that resident fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes
