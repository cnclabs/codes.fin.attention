these expenses rose for several reasons approximately higher catalog circulation for the company s existing catalogs  the expenses of rue de france  inc which was acquired in april  and increased costs of operating the company s website

during fiscal  the company recorded pretax restructuring and other charges aggregating million  which included severance pay for a former officer 
million and costs of a restructuring plan million 
the restructuring plan the plan was approved in february to streamline operations and reduce costs in light of decreased consumer spending and an uncertain economy

the restructuring and other charges reduced fiscal net income by million 
per share 
net interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase of 
million was due primarily to higher interest rates on the company s cash investments 
there were no short term borrowings during fiscal year or fiscal year the company s unusually high effective income tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to recognizing the expiration of charitable contribution tax carryforwards 
the company recorded additional tax expense of 
million related to the expiration of these credits  which reduced earnings per share by in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective february   the company adopted the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and recorded a one time charge to earnings of 
million  net of income taxes of 
million

catalog circulation was lower in fiscal compared to the prior year

revenue per catalog increased in fiscal by approximately  due principally to higher response rates 
the significant factors which led to increased revenue per catalog were more new product offerings  targeted circulation  and the company s continued value pricing 
product and delivery costs include the cost of merchandise sold  the cost of receiving  personalizing  filling and shipping orders 
these costs million declined by million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal  due principally to the lower volume of orders shipped 
as a percentage of revenues  product and delivery costs increased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to higher wage rates at the company s national distribution center  the operation of a third call center in las vegas  nevada  and increased shipping and handling costs to satisfy demand for backordered products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  the single largest component of which is the cost of producing  printing  and mailing the company s catalogs  were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  principally due to reduced catalog circulation

seasonality the company s business is seasonal 
historically  approximately of the company s revenue and substantially all of its net income has been realized during the third and fourth fiscal quarters  which encompass the period september through february 
lower revenue and net losses are typically incurred during the first and second fiscal quarters  comprising the period march through august 
the company believes this is the general pattern associated with other mail order and retail gift businesses 
because of slower demand for its products in the first half of its fiscal year  and because of fixed costs incurred to increase sales year round and invest in future growth  the company reported a cumulative net loss during the first six months of fiscal   and due to these seasonal factors  management expects to incur a loss for the first half of fiscal as well 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet and liquidity are strong 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of february   the current ratio was at february  compared to at february  the reduction in the current ratio was due principally to lower accounts receivable and inventory  and higher accounts payable and accrued expenses as of february  the company has not borrowed money in the current fiscal year  its working capital needs have been met with funds on hand and cash generated from operations

in addition  the company has partnered with ibm to develop a new website 
the cost for the development of the website  and the related software and hardware is expected to be million in fiscal aside from the new website development  fiscal capital spending is expected to be comparable to the company s annual spending in the past several years 
in fiscal  the company also plans to conduct an extensive review and assessment of its major computer systems  facilities and business processes 
a major goal of the study is to plan systems that will enable the company to take advantage of additional business opportunities  streamline operations  and reduce its costs 
the company has a million revolving credit facility with two banks  expiring in fiscal this credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital needs  capital expenditures  and up to million of letters of credit 
up to million of the facility can be converted into term loans  with maturity dates no later than at the company s option  interest is payable at libor plus basis points  prime rate  bankers acceptance rate plus basis points  or a fixed rate 
the credit facility is unsecured  and the company is subject to financial covenants principally relating to its working capital  net worth  interest coverage ratio and capital spending restrictions

million of cash from the issuance of common stock through its employee benefit plans during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the company has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends commencing may it increased its quarterly dividend from 
to 
per share in september  and from 
to

prior to this  the company completed an earlier stock repurchase program in which it repurchased million shares for a total cost of million 
cumulatively from october through february   the company has spent million to repurchase its stock in the open market 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  funds on hand  and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating needs for the upcoming fiscal year 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange the company is generally able to reflect cost increases and decreases resulting from the effects of inflation and foreign currency fluctuations in its selling prices 
in addition  most foreign purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by these factors 
recently issued accounting standards in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs which requires that amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees be classified as revenue 
the company previously recorded these fees as reductions of the related expenses 
the adoption of eitf had no effect on the net income of the company

the company recorded a one time charge of 
million  net of income taxes of 
million  or 
per share in fiscal  to reflect the accounting change 
the use of the revised method reduced the fiscal loss before cumulative effect by  net of income taxes 
the company does not expect the implementation of sab to have a material effect on future operating results on an annual basis  however  it will significantly impact the results of the third and fourth quarters  similar to the impact disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s earnings are impacted by significant increases in paper prices 
in order to mitigate this risk  the company implemented a price protection program by entering into a collar hedge contract 
this contract covers a certain grade of paper which the company uses  among other grades  to produce its catalogs 
there is a floor and ceiling to paper prices within the contract 
if paper prices remain within the range of the contract  there will be no payment to either party to the contract 
if paper prices exceed the established ceiling  the company will be reimbursed by the counterparty for the excess 
conversely  if paper prices fall below the established floor  the company would pay the counterparty 
the company did not pay a premium in connection with the establishment of the contract 
no amounts are required to be recorded in the accompanying financial statements 
as of january and february  market prices for paper fell below the established floor of the contract 
the company  therefore  made minimal payments to the counterparty 
in march  the company renegotiated the floor and ceiling prices under the contract and extended the term of the contract until august the contract now covers  short tons of paper between march and its expiration date 
the company has performed a sensitivity analysis to determine what the impact would be under the hedge contract if the price of paper covered by this contract were to change by over the next months 
the price as of february  for the grade of paper subject to this contract was per short ton 
if the price of this grade of paper should increase by over the next months  the company would be entitled to maximum payments totaling  from the counterparty 
if the price of this grade of paper should decrease by over the next months  the company would be required to make payment to the counterparty in the maximum total amount of  however  these payments made would be offset by the corresponding cost savings the company would achieve in the lower prices it would pay for its purchases of paper 
therefore  the overall cost would not be material to the company s financial statements for fiscal
