results of operations for the year ended december   the company s revenues decreased compared to this decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in revenues in the united states 
the decrease in domestic revenues was primarily due to lower revenues during the transition period as the new business model was being implemented 
for the year ended december   the company s revenues decreased compared to this decrease in revenues was primarily due to decrease in revenues in north america  partially offset by a increase in revenues in japan and a increase in europe 
the decrease in north american revenues was primarily due to a decrease in kcp sales caused by the liquidation of dealer inventories and a soft air abrasion market 
sales of lasers  pac lights and intraoral cameras increased in north america during  partially off setting the softer kcp sales 
the increase in revenues in europe was mainly attributable to the addition of new distributors in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december   compared to in and in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in compared to and was due to the company increasing its reserve for slow moving inventory in response to the decline in the air abrasion and camera markets 
when the increase in this reserve is factored out  gross profit would have improved to in selling  general and administrative expenses were  in   in and  in the significant increase in was primarily attributable to non cash impairment charges and charges related to demonstration inventory units 
in  the continued decline in sales of the company s kcp and camera units  and the underperformance of the dental probe units  served as indicators of impairment for certain intangible assets associated with the previous acquisitions of texas airsonics  inc  dental vision direct  inc  and dental probe  inc 
following the guidance of fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company projected future cash flows for these products based on management s best estimates of likely future sales  less costs of goods sold and selling expenses 
the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the recorded value of the assets related to these product lines  indicating impairment existed 
to determine the amount of the impairment  the fair value of the related assets was determined by comparing the future cash flows discounted at a rate of to the fair value of the related long lived assets based on current market selling prices of similar equipment 
the company recorded an impairment of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with the aforementioned acquisitions to the fair value of those assets 
this impairment expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations 
as part of the transition to the new business model  the company decided to discontinue its demonstration unit sales initiative 
this change resulted in the company disposing of approximately million in demonstration units that had been on loan to sales personnel  universities  and prospective customers that were no longer deemed salable 
this charge was included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to sales and marketing expenses in the first half of the year which were higher as a percentage of sales primarily due to increased selling  marketing and general and administrative expenses related to the camera business acquired from dental vision direct and amortization of goodwill also related to the camera business 
research and development expenses were  in   in  and  in the expenditures related primarily to the development of new products and enhancements to current products

for  a licensing agreement with chart it for  and settlement of  from kreativ regarding patent litigation 
other income decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to this decrease from is primarily due to non recurring items in such as the receipt of the kreativ lawsuit settlement payment of  and a gain on the sale of the michigan building of  interest expense was  in   in  and  in the decrease in interest expense in is due to the reduction of the outstanding debt 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the debt incurred to fund the acquisition of dental vision direct in august in  the company recorded a  charge for income tax 
the company s income taxes at us statutory rates  differs from its recorded income tax expense primarily due to nondeductible goodwill amortization 
in  based on the company s past history of earnings  the company reversed its previously recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowance as the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would realize the related deferred tax asset 
in  the effect of the reversal was to increase net income by  for this income tax benefit 
with the loss incurred in and the continued downturn in the dental products industry  uncertainties exist as to the future realization of the deferred tax asset under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  the company re established the tax asset valuation allowance 
recording this allowance results in a current year non cash tax expense of approximately million 
at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire in various amounts in the years through liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities provided  in cash resources in cash provided by operating activities in was due largely to reductions in receivables of million and inventory of approximately  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable of approximately the company s investing activities used  in cash resources in the cash used in investing activities in related primarily to the purchase of property and equipment 
on september   the company renewed an agreement for a  revolving line of credit from a bank  with interest at the bank s prime rate or the libor rate eurodollar rates  which were approximately at december  plus a margin of  which expires in september the company s borrowing is secured by a pledge of the company s accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  instruments  patents  copyrights and trademarks 
the agreement contains several qualitative and financial covenants 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with some of the financial covenants and the bank issued a letter waiving the event of default 
subsequent to december   the agreement was amended to include  among other things  a borrowing base formula based on the company s levels of inventory  accounts receivable and fixed assets  and a change to a variable eurodollar loan margin rate based on certain company performance ratios 
as of december   the company had million outstanding 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the company had approximately million available to borrow at december  the company believes  based upon its current business plan  that current cash  available financing resources and cash generated through operations should be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated short term and long term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
new accounting standards and disclosures accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in september  the fasb agreed to defer the effective date of statement no 
for one year until the first quarter of  citing concerns over interpretations on important implementation issues 
the management of the company  because of its minimal use of derivatives  does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the consolidated financial position of the company
