the company achieved continued profitability in  with significant increases in assets  deposits and loans 
the company continues to benefit from strategic decisions made in  when the company initiated a program of prudent  managed growth  this program resulted in higher levels of earning assets and interest revenue in  and the company s profitability was also in part a reflection of the continued low levels of non performing loans  other real estate owned  and other non earning assets 
average assets in were  compared to  in and  in as was the case in and  the company s asset growth in was funded by an increase in deposits  as well as by the retention of earnings for the year 
the company generated net income of  in compared to a profit of  in and a profit of  in net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest income earned on interest earning assets over interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest income or expense are determined by the average volume of interest bearing assets or liabilities  and the average rate of interest earned or paid on those assets or liabilities 
as was the case during  in the company s continued growth efforts resulted in an increase in interest earning assets  including loans 
the bank s core loan portfolio increased significantly during the asset growth reflects a corresponding increase in total deposits resulting from an increase in full service bank branches during while the deposit growth was centered in non interest bearing deposits and time deposits  there was also growth in money market deposits and savings deposits 
deposit growth interest rates increased slightly in both and from the levels  and the higher deposit levels led to significant increases in interest expense in and after remaining relatively stable the prior year 
other operating income other operating income remained relatively constant in from the prior year after a substantial increase in over the total 
other operating income for was  versus  in and  for the year the bank s trust administration services corp 
tasc  a wholly owned subsidiary that provides administrative services to self directed retirement plans  had revenue that totaled  during and  during  there was no such revenue in the bank s merchant services operation  which provides credit card deposit and clearing services to retailers and other credit card accepting businesses  had revenue that totaled  in   in and  in the other operating income included gains on sales of land of  the other operating income figure included gains on sales of land of  in and  in loan portfolio and provision for loan losses the loan portfolio consisted of the following at december  and dollars in thousands commercial loans   real estate construction loans   real estate loans   bankers acceptances government guaranteed loans   other loans  total loans   less allowances for loan losses   deferred loan fees net loans   the allowance for possible loan losses is intended to reflect the known and unknown risks which are inherent in a loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses is continually evaluated in light of many factors  including loan loss experience and current economic conditions 
the company s emphasis on maintaining high asset quality continued in  and as a result  non performing assets loans past due ninety days or more excluding government guaranteed loans  loans on nonaccrual status  and other real estate owned totaled  less than of total loans at the end of although this is an increase from  on december   and  at the end of  management believes the allowance for possible loan losses as of december  was adequate in relation to both existing and potential risks in the loan portfolio 
the bank has historically evaluated the adequacy of its allowance for possible loan losses on an overall basis rather than by specific categories of loans 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses  management considers such factors as historical loan loss experience  known problem loans  evaluations made by bank regulatory authorities  assessment of economic conditions and other appropriate data to identify the risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for possible loan losses has been allocated to the major categories of loans as set forth in the following table 
the allocations are estimates based upon historical loss experience and management judgment 
the allowance for possible loan losses should not be interpreted as an indication that charge offs will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the allocation indicates future charge off trends 
furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories  since even in this allocation is an unallocated portion  and  as previously stated  the total allowance is applicable to the entire portfolio 
allowance ratio of allowance ratio of for loans to for loans to possible total possible total loan losses loans loan losses loans commercial loans  real estate loans 
  gov t guaranteed bankers acceptances other loans unallocated total   the allowance for possible loan losses is increased by provisions which are charged to operating expense and is reduced by loan chargeoffs 
any subsequent recoveries of charged off loans are added back into the allowance 
based on its ongoing evaluation of loan risks  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses  in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
by way of comparison  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
these transactions brought the balance of the allowance for possible loan losses at the end of to  or of total loans  compared to  or of total loans at december   and compared to  or of total loans at the end of the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  effective january  this statement defines an impaired loan as one for which it is likely that an institution will be unable to collect all amounts due that is  all principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan 
the statement generally requires impaired loans to be measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan  or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
in  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
during  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
in contrast during  the company had identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired 
the company s policy is generally to discontinue the accrual of interest income on impaired loans  and to recognize income on such loans only after the loan principal has been repaid in full  and to establish a general loss reserve for each of the loans 
operating expenses total operating expenses rose in  to  from  in and  in while the total expense figures increased primarily due to increases in overall bank growth  most components continue to be moderated by the effects of an ongoing program of expense control 
salaries and related benefits expense increased again in  rising to  from a total of  and from  in the increase in this expense category principally reflects the increases in staffing which took place due to the addition of the tasc operation as well as staffing in the new regional offices as part of the company s growth initiative 
occupancy expense rose in  to  from  in and a total of  the increases reflect the rent paid on the various facilities which house the bank s new regional offices and the tasc operation 
custodial and other services to customers declined to in as they declined in both and standing at  for versus  in this category typically fluctuates in conjunction with the deposit balances maintained by customers  and this factor accounts for the changes in this area over the past three years 
other expenses rose again in as they did in and other expenses totaled  in compared to  in  which was increased from  in other expenses in include professional services of  a decrease from the prior year when professional services were  for  a significant increase after totaling  in data processing fees rose in to  compared to  in and  in a positive factor was the continued low level of premiums for fdic insurance  reflecting the banking industry s achievement of full capitalization of the bank insurance fund as defined by applicable statute 
general insurance increased to  during from  during and  for equipment expense increased to  during from  during and  for most of the remaining categories of other expense generally remained stable directors fees were  in   in  and  in  and other expenses  which rose to  in from  in and  in principally due to higher costs of services provided to customers 
taxes the combined effects of the activity described above resulted in income before taxes of  in  up from  in  and  in in  the company recorded tax provisions of  during  the company recorded tax provisions of  and during  the company recorded tax provisions of  as a result  the company generated net income of  in  compared to  in  and versus net income of  in liquidity  sources of funds  and capital resources the bank continues to enjoy a liquid financial position 
total liquid assets cash and due from banks  investment securities  and federal funds sold totaled  and  or and of total deposits at december  and  respectively 
in addition  at december   some million of the banks total loans consisted of government guaranteed loans which represent a significant source of liquidity due to the active secondary markets which exist for these assets 
the ratio of net loans including government guaranteed loans to deposits was and at the end of and  respectively 
in january  the bank established tasc  a wholly owned subsidiary that provides administrative services to self directed retirement plans 
deposits held for tasc clients by the bank represent approximately and of the bank s total deposits as of december  and prior to the commencement of the tasc operations  the bank had a long term relationship with transcorp pension services  inc transcorp 
the bank s deposit and service relationships with transcorp ended in deposits of custodial clients of retirement plans administered by transcorp pension services  a corporate customer of the bank  represented approximately of the bank s total deposits as of december  the bank s investment portfolio continues to be composed of high quality  low risk securities  principally us agency securities 
losses of  were recorded on securities sales during no gains or losses were recorded on securities sales during or as of december  the bank s investment portfolio contained gross unrealized gains of  and no gross unrealized losses  for net unrealized gains of  as of december  the bank s investment portfolio contained no gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of  for net unrealized losses of  the company adopted sfas no 
in  with the result that the net unrealized gains and losses gave rise to a  net of taxes increase in shareholders equity as of december   and a  decrease net of taxes in the company s shareholders equity as of december  because the company s holdings of securities are intended to serve as a source of liquidity should conditions warrant  the securities have been classified by the company as available for sale  and thus the unrealized gains and losses had no effect on the company s income statement 
the bank s management has attempted to match the rates and maturities of its interest bearing assets and liabilities as part of its liquidity and asset liability management policy 
the objective of this policy is to moderate the fluctuations of net interest revenue which result from changes in the level of interest rates 
the table which follows indicates the repricing or maturity characteristics of the major categories of the bank s assets and liabilities  and thus the relative sensitivity of the bank s net interest income to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
a positive gap for a period indicates that an upward or downward movement in the level of interest rates would have a corresponding change in net interest income  while a negative gap implies that an interest rate movement would result in an inverse change in net interest income 
one month six months one year non but less but less but less five interest floating less than than than than years earning category rate one month six months one year five years or more or bearing total fed funds sold   time deposits with other banks investment securities   subtotal    loans   total earning assets    cash and due from banks   premises and equipment   other real estate owned other assets   total non earning assets   total assets     funds purchased   repurchase agreements subtotal   savings deposits   money market deposits   time deposits     total bearing liabilities      demand deposits   other liabilities   equity capital   total non bearing liabilities   total liabilities       gap      cumulative gap       as the table indicates  the vast majority of the company s assets are either floating rate or  if fixed rate  have short maturities 
since the yields on these assets quickly adjust to reflect changes in the overall level of interest rates  there are no significant unrealized gains or losses with respect to the company s assets  nor is there much likelihood of large realized or unrealized gains or losses developing in the future 
for this reason  realized or unrealized gains or losses are not expected to have any significant impact on the company s future operating results or liquidity 
the company continues to maintain a strong and prudent capital position 
total shareholders equity was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the company s capital ratios for those dates in comparison with regulatory capital requirements were as follows leverage ratio tier i capital to assets first regional bancorp regulatory requirement the regulatory requirement listed represents the level of capital required for adequately capitalized status 
in addition  bank regulators have risk adjusted capital guidelines which assign risk weighting to assets and off balance sheet items and place increased emphasis on common equity 
the company s risk adjusted capital ratios for the dates listed in comparison with the risk adjusted capital requirements were as follows tier i capital to assets first regional bancorp regulatory requirement tier i tier ii capital to assets first regional bancorp regulatory requirement the company is well capitalized under regulation guidelines and believes that it will continue to meet all applicable capital standards 
during  the company established an employee stock ownership plan consisting of  shares of first regional common stock acquired in market transactions or directly from first regional bancorp at an average price of per share 
this new plan will build the capital base of first regional bank and provide its employees with a powerful incentive to achieve further improvements in first regional s operating performance 
during  the company repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock at a total cost of  and during  the company repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock at a total cost of  as the average price paid for these repurchased shares was less than the book value per share outstanding  these purchases resulted in an increase in book value per share of the remaining outstanding shares  thus benefiting existing shareholders 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company differs significantly from other industries  since virtually all of its assets and liabilities are monetary 
during periods of inflation  companies with net monetary assets will always experience a reduction in purchasing power 
inflation continues to have an impact on salary  supply  and occupancy expenses  but the rate of inflation in general and its impact on these expenses in particular has remained moderate in recent years
