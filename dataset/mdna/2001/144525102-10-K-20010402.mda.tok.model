the company is comprised of two business segments 
see note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements for financial information about these business segments 
the company sells prescription and nonprescription human and veterinary products through its medical services division and consumer and bulk raw material products through its consumer products subsidiary  caraloe  inc the company s research and product portfolio are based primarily on complex carbohydrates isolated from the aloe vera l 
plant

significant cash outflows during included investments in property and equipment of  and expenses related to the aliminase 
tm 
clinical trial of  customers with significant accounts receivable balances at the end of included mannatech  inc  allegiance health care  owens minor  and medline industries  and of these amounts   has been collected as of march  as of december   the company had no material capital commitments other than its leases and agreements with suppliers 
in march  the company  with four other investors  formed aloe and herbs international inc  a panamanian corporation  with the sole intent of acquiring a  acre tract of land in costa rica to be used for the production of aloe vera l 
leaves to be sold to the company at competitive  local market rates 
this would allow the company to save approximately on the per kilogram cost of leaves as compared to the cost of importing leaves from other central and south american countries 
aloe herbs subsequently formed a wholly owned subsidiary  rancho aloe cr  cr  a costa rica corporation  which acquired the land in april the company provided a cash advance of  which is evidenced by a note receivable  due in installments  with payments being made monthly based upon farm production 
the company also advanced  to aloe herbs in november for the acquisition of an irrigation system to improve production on the farm and allow harvesting of leaves year round 
the company was also granted a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock of aloe herbs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company fully reserved all amounts owed to it by aloe herbs  in the total amount of  due to the start up nature of the business 
in  the company received payments totaling  from aloe herbs against the amount due 
the first shipment of leaves from rancho aloe to the company was made in march and the company purchased a total of  of aloe vera l 
leaves from rancho aloe the company s interest in aloe herbs at december  is approximately 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with comerica bank texas for a  line of credit  secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
this credit facility had an outstanding balance of  at december  to fund operating needs 
in february  the company entered into a supply agreement with oregon freeze dry  inc ofd  its supplier of freeze dried products 
the agreement contained a minimum purchase commitment of  the agreement expired in august the company established a reserve of  in and increased the reserve by  in the second quarter of to cover its liability to ofd under the agreement 
the company is currently negotiating with ofd regarding purchase arrangements beyond the term of the agreement  but no agreement has been finalized as of march  the company believes that its available cash resources and expected cash flows from operations will provide the funds necessary to finance its current operations 
however  the company does not expect that its current cash resources will be sufficient to finance future major clinical studies and costs of filing new drug applications necessary to develop its products to their full commercial potential 
additional funds  therefore  may need to be raised through equity offerings  borrowings  licensing arrangements or other means  and there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funds on satisfactory terms when they are needed 
the board of directors recently authorized the company to repurchase up to one million shares of its outstanding common stock 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters above 
the company believes it has the financial resources necessary to repurchase shares from time to time pursuant to the board s repurchase authorization 
the company is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
certain of the company s proposed products will require governmental approval prior to commercial use 
the approval process applicable to prescription pharmaceutical products usually takes several years and typically requires substantial expenditures 
the company and any licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals 
future united states or foreign legislative or administrative acts could also prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or any licensees products 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested could delay or preclude the company or any licensees from marketing their products  or could limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were  in  compared with  in sales of manapolr by caraloe in the form of raw materials and consumer nutritional products  decreased  from  in to  in total sales of the company s wound and skin care products in were  as compared to  in  primarily due to a significant reduction in pricing to maintain market competitiveness 
while wound care sales declined versus the prior year  unit volumes declined only 
the company s wound and skin care products are marketed domestically to hospitals  nursing homes  home health care agencies and acute care providers 
this market has continued to be very competitive and price sensitive as a result of pressures to control health care costs and has become increasingly commodity oriented 
in addition  the market is heavily influenced by government reimbursement programs 
the home health care segment of the market again experienced significant turmoil in as many of the company s customers either went out of business or purchased commodity products 
this had a negative impact on the company s wound care sales to that segment 
nursing homes were also impacted by government regulations in  as government mandated reimbursement changes due to go into effect in january were postponed until late year many nursing home facilities and the dealers who supply them postponed buying decisions and liquidated inventory in anticipation of the regulations taking effect 
in response to these market trends  the company pursued a strategy to move its wound care line of products toward value added specialty products which focus more on product performance rather than price alone  such as the radia 
tm 
line of products for the management of the side effects of cancer therapy 
the company also sells its wound care products to international distributors  primarily in italy  australia  singapore  mexico and argentina  with lesser sales to a number of central and south american countries
