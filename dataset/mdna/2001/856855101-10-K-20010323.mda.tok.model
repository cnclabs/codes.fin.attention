balance sheet analysis the composition of assets and liabilities are generally the result of management decisions influenced by market forces 
at both december  and  the company reported total assets of billion 
lending activities the company s largest single asset category continues to be loans 
the company s gross loans  as a percentage of total deposits  were at december  compared to at december  the following table shows the company s loan portfolio composition on the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
at december  of of of of of total total total total total commercial      commercial real estate      real estate      installment      other      total loans      total loans outstanding decreased million in mainly due to the balance sheet restructuring offset by loan growth 
total loans outstanding increased million in mainly due to the bni acquisition and internal loan growth over the preceding twelve months 
the bni acquisition accounted for million of the company s loan growth 
internally  loans grew million due to strong loan demand 
real estate loans represent the company s largest loan category  comprising of the loan portfolio at december  compared to at december  the decrease was mainly due to management s decision to restructure the balance sheet through the sale of approximately million of mortgage loans in the first quarter and approximately million of mortgage loans in the fourth quarter the concentration of real estate loans decreased from in to in  which resulted from management s strategic decisions to diversify the loan portfolio into commercial and installment loans and the incorporation of bni s loan portfolio 
the company continues to emphasize commercial real estate lending 
commercial real estate activity increased million in compared to due to internal growth and million in compared to due to the bni acquisition 
the bni acquisition accounted for million of this increase in the remaining increase was due to internal growth during  after relatively flat activity during due to intense pricing competition in the company s markets during the year 
the company s commercial real estate loans continue to be generally secured by owner occupied  improved property such as office buildings  warehouses  small manufacturing operations  and retail facilities located in the company s primary market areas subject to a maximum loan to value ratio pursuant to its loan policy 
loans for construction and land development are generally secured by the property under construction or development up to a maximum loan to value of of estimated cost or appraisal value of the completed project whichever is less 
the company further monitors construction and land development credits by disbursing draws under the credit commitment upon satisfactory title company inspections of construction progress and evidence of proper lien waivers 
the borrower s creditworthiness and the economic feasibility and cash flow abilities of the project are fundamental concerns in the company s commercial real estate and construction land development lending 
loans secured by commercial property  whether existing or under construction  and land development are generally larger in size and involve greater risks than residential mortgage loans because payments on loans secured by commercial property are dependent upon the successful operation and management of these properties  businesses  or developments 
as a result  the value of properties securing such loans are likely to be subject to the local real estate market and general economic conditions  including movements in interest rates 
the company generally writes commercial real estate loans for maturities up to five years although the total amortization period may be as long as twenty years  amortized monthly 
the company generally writes construction and land development loans on terms up to a maximum of months and requires the borrower to make defined principal reductions at stated intervals during that term 
the company additionally attempts to have construction credits further supported by end mortgage commitments wherever possible 
the company will generally make credit extensions for land development projects to experienced  strong borrowers with adequate outside liquidity to support the project in the event the actual project performance is slower than projection 
the company s real estate loans  like all of the company s loans  are underwritten according to its written loan policy 
the loan policy sets forth the term  debt service capacity  credit extension  and loan to value guidelines  which the company considers acceptable to recognize the level of risk associated with each specific loan category 
the following table sets forth the percentage composition of the real estate loan portfolio as of december  family first liens on residential real estate multifamily residential family junior liens on residential real estate including home equity lines of credit construction  land development  and farmland commercial loans increased million in due to internal loan growth 
commercial loans increased million in with bni accounting for million of this increase 
commercial loans are underwritten according to the company s loan policy  which sets forth the amount of credit which can be extended based upon the borrower s cash flow  debt service capacity  and discounted collateral value 
commercial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the business 
as a result  the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be dependent on the success of the business itself  which  in turn  is likely to be dependent upon the general economic environment 
in recognition of this risk  the company emphasizes capacity to repay the loan  adequacy of the borrower s capital  an evaluation of the industry conditions affecting the borrower  and current credit file documentation 
the company s commercial loans are typically secured by the borrower s business assets such as  inventory  accounts receivable  fixtures  and equipment 
generally  commercial loans carry the personal guaranties of the principals 
installment loans increased million during due to loan growth 
installment loans increased million during with the bni acquisition representing million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million was due to increased volume of indirect auto loans 
the company cultivates installment loans primarily through the purchase of loan contracts from its network of auto dealers developed over the years 
the company continues to pursue additional auto dealer contacts to build this network of loan referrals 
the company s indirect auto loan underwriting emphasizes the purchase of the highest quality loan contracts to minimize risk of loss in this lending activity 
other loans increased million in due to increases in municipal loans and overdrafts 
in other loans decreased thousand  primarily due to decreases in personal reserve accounts  student loans and municipal loans 
the following table shows the maturity of loans excluding residential mortgages on one to four family residences  installment loans  and lease financing outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands 
also provided are the amounts due after one year classified according to the sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
after one after within but within five one year five years years total commercial     real estate     loan maturing after one year with fixed interest rates   variable interest rates   total   risk elements in the loan portfolio certain risks are inherent in the lending function including a borrower s subsequent inability to pay  insufficient collateral coverage  and changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by adherence to a written set of loan policies and procedures 
included in these policies and procedures are underwriting practices covering debt service coverage  loan to value ratios  and loan term 
evidence of a specific repayment source is required on each credit extension  with documentation of the borrower s repayment capacity 
generally  this repayment source is the borrower s cash flow  which must demonstrate the ability to service the debt based upon historical results and conservative projections of future performance 
management maintains the allowance for loan losses the allowance at a level considered adequate to provide for estimable and probable loan losses 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings  and is reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
at december   the allowance was million an increase of thousand from the balance at december  the determination of allowance adequacy is based upon an on going quarterly evaluation of the company s loan portfolio conducted by the internal loan review officer and reviewed by management 
these evaluations consider a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  loan portfolio size and composition  previous loss experience  the borrower s financial condition  collateral adequacy  the level of non performing loans 
as a percentage of total loans outstanding  the allowance increased to at the end of compared to at the end of this increase was mainly due to changes in the total loan portfolio with increases in commercial and commercial real estate loans and decreases in real estate mortgages 
based on its analyses  management considers the allowance adequate to recognize the risk inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio at december  the balance of the allowance and actual loan loss experience for the last five years is summarized in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  balance at beginning of period      charge offs commercial real estate installment other total charge offs  recoveries commercial real estate installment other total recoveries net charge offs balance of acquired allowance at date of acquisition  additions charged to operations balance at end of period      ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding net charge offs to total allowance allowance to year end loans outstanding when  in the opinion of management  serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
at the time a loan is classified as nonaccrual  interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and interest income accrued in the prior year is charged to the allowance 
the company generally does not recognize income on loans past due days or more 
the following table summarizes non performing assets on the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
at or for the years ended december  nonaccrual loans      accruing loans past due days or more restructured loans total non performing and restructured loans      other real estate owned total non performing assets      ratios non performing loans to total loans allowance to non performing loans non performing assets to total assets interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans under original terms interest income recorded during the period on nonaccrual loans the percentage of non performing loans to total loans increased to at december  from at december  nonaccrual loans increased approximately million mainly due to one commercial loan proactively classified by management as nonaccrual due to the borrower s loss of a significant customer 
the company is adequately collateralized on the credit and feels the risk of loss is minimal 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
fasb defines a loan as impaired if  based on current information or events  it is probable that a creditor will not be able to collect all amounts both contractual principal and interest due in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
at december   the company identified approximately million in loans considered impaired pursuant to this definition 
these loans are included as part of the nonaccrual loans set forth in the table above and represent less than of the company s gross loan portfolio at december  based upon the analyses of the underlying collateral value of these loans and the low percentage of these loans in relation to the gross loan portfolio  management believes the allowance is adequate to provide for the inherent risk associated with these loans 
at december   there were no additional loans to borrowers where available information would indicate that such loans were likely to later be included as nonaccrual  impaired as defined in financial accounting standards board statement no 
 past due  or restructured 
investment activities investment securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities that the company does not have either the positive intent and or the ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale and carried at their respective fair market value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale  net of related tax effects  are carried as a component of shareholders equity 
the company has no assets classified as trading 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
total investment securities outstanding at december  increased million  due to investing the proceeds from the mortgage loan securitization primarily in mortgage related securities 
the following table presents the combined amortized cost of the company s held to maturity and available for sale investment securities on the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
at december  of of of total total total us treasury securities and obligations of us government    agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions    mortgage related securities    other securities    total    during  balances in mortgage related securities increased million mainly due to investing the proceeds of the mortgage securitizations in adjustable rate products to shorten the duration of the asset side of the company s balance sheet and increase the liquidity of these funds 
the company s mortgage related securities represent balances outstanding on fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s supported by one to four family residential mortgage securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
to avoid exposure to prepayments  wide market value fluctuations  and recoverability  the company purchases only the conservative early tranches of the respective cmos 
these investments closely resemble treasury securities in their shorter maturities  marketability  and repayment predictability and accordingly are the least volatile to the impact of market interest rate fluctuations 
at december   the remaining average life of the company s mortgage related securities was slightly less than three years 
due to the short remaining assumed maturities of these investments and its historical experience with these investments  management does not consider the company to be exposed to significant interest rate risk or recoverability related to these investments 
at december   mortgage related securities accounted for of the company s investment portfolio compared to at december  us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies treasuries agencies decreased million in due to the company s decision to increase the amount of investments deployed in mortgage related securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions to take advantage of the comparatively higher yields available on these investment products 
as a result of this decline  the percentage of the company s investment portfolio invested in treasuries agencies decreased to at december  from at december  obligations of states and political subdivisions increased million at december  compared to december  due to the company reinvesting treasuries agencies maturities in municipal investments to enhance its portfolio yield 
at december   obligations of states and political subdivisions comprised of the company s investment portfolio as compared to at december  other securities increased million in  mainly due to the company s additional investment in federal home loan bank stock during the year 
at december   other securities represented of the company s investment portfolio compared to at december  the maturities and weighted average yield of the company s investment securities at december  are presented in the following table dollars in thousands 
taxable equivalent adjustments using a tax rate have been made in calculating the yields on obligations of states and political subdivisions 
after one after five within but within but within after one year five years ten years ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield us treasury securities and obligations of us government    agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions     mortgage related securities     other securities   total     at december   the company had approximately thousand in net unrealized gains on its held to maturity securities and approximately thousand in net unrealized losses on its available for sale securities 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from marketable equity securities are impacted by the current market price quoted for the underlying security in relation to the price at which the security was acquired by the company 
unrealized gains and losses on investment securities are the result of changes in market interest rates and the relationship of the company s investments to those rates for comparable maturities 
unrealized gains generally result from the interest rates on the company s portfolio of investment securities exceeding market rates for comparable maturities 
conversely  unrealized losses generally result from the interest rates on the company s portfolio of investment securities falling below market rates for comparable maturities 
if material  unrealized losses could negatively impact the company s future performance as earnings from these investments would be less than alternative investments currently available and may not provide as wide a spread between earnings and funding costs 
the company does not consider its investment portfolio exposed to material adverse impact to future operating performance resulting from market interest rate fluctuations

cash and cash equivalents are generally the company s most liquid assets 
the company s level of operating  financing  and investing activities during a given period impact the resultant level of cash and cash equivalents reported 
the company had liquid assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
liquid assets in excess of necessary cash reserves are generally invested in short term investments such as federal funds sold  commercial paper  and interest earning deposits 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is an inherent part of the banking business as financial institutions gather deposits and borrow other funds to finance interest earning assets 
interest rate risk results when repricing of rates paid on deposits and other borrowing does not coincide with the repricing of interest earning assets 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the following table shows the estimated maturity and repricing structure of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for three different independent and cumulative time intervals as of december  dollars in millions 
for purposes of presentation in the following table  the company used the national deposit decay rate assumptions published by its regulators as of december   which  for now accounts  money market accounts  and savings deposits in the one year or less category were   and  respectively 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact general interest rate movements may have on the company s net interest income as the actual repricing experience of certain assets and liabilities  such as loan prepayments and deposit withdrawals  is beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities may reprice at intervals different from the maturities assumed in the following table given the general movement in interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates

variable rate and maturing fixed rate loans are the primary interest sensitive assets repricing within one year 
time deposits are the most significant liabilities subject to repricing within one year on the funding side of the balance sheet 
during  the company securitized and sold million of long term fixed rate mortgages  replacing them with adjustable rate mortgage investment securities first repriceable in one to three years 
the company strategically entered into this securitization to shorten the duration of the asset side of its balance sheet and enhance liquidity to fund future loan growth 
at december   the company reported a negative cumulative one year gap of compared to at december  the company s liability sensitivity at december  would normally indicate that the company s net interest margin would improve if rates decreased and deteriorate if interest rates increased 
capital resources total shareholders equity decreased million and million in and  respectively and increased 
million in the equity decreases are primarily due to the company s stock repurchase program under which the company repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a average price of per share in and  an additional 
million shares at a average price of per share in the increase in was mainly due to the retirement of home s recognition and retention plan commensurate with the merger and the annual allocation of esop shares in both the company s and home s respective plans 
total dividends declared were million in  million in and million in the company maintained a cash dividend declared of 
per share in each of these years 
the decreases in each year are the direct result of the stock repurchase program 
total assets remained relatively unchanged in in comparison to  increased in due primarily to the acquisition of bni  and increased in asset growth  coupled with the company s stock repurchase program  resulted in average equity to asset ratio of  and in the years  and respectively 
there are certain regulatory constraints which affect the company s capital levels 
at december   the company s actual regulatory amounts and ratios exceeded those necessary to be defined as well capitalized under regulatory framework 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional explanation of these regulatory constraints 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time impacted by inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the company s other expenses which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
consequently  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the general levels of inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on the company s financial results is its ability to react to interest rate changes and endeavors to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide fluctuations in the company s net interest margin

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us currency with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has a limited number of agricultural loans and accordingly has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates are assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk irr is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however excessive levels of irr can significantly impact the company s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains irr at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
evaluating a financial institution s exposure to interest rate changes includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to monitor and control irr and the organization s quantitative exposure level 
when assessing the irr management process  the company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems  and internal controls are in place to maintain irr at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
evaluating the quantitative level of irr exposure requires the company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and where appropriate  asset quality 
the federal reserve board  together with the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic  adopted a joint agency policy statement on irr 
the policy statement provides guidance to examiners and bankers on sound practices for managing irr  which forms the basis for an ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of irr management at institutions under their respective supervision 
the policy statement also outlines fundamental elements of sound management that have been identified in prior federal reserve guidance and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing irr 
specifically  the guidance emphasizes the need for active board of director and senior management oversight and a comprehensive risk management process which effectively identifies  measures  and controls irr 
financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid 
the rates of interest an institution earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  an institution is exposed to lower profit margins or losses if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
for example  assume that an institution s assets carry intermediate or long term fixed rates and that those assets are funded with short term liabilities 
if market interest rates rise by the time the short term liabilities must be refinanced  the increase in the institution s interest expense on its liabilities may not be sufficiently offset if assets continue to earn at the contractual long term fixed rates 
accordingly  an institution s profits could decrease on existing assets because the institution will either have lower net interest income or  possibly  higher net interest expense 
similar risks exist when assets are subject to contractual interest rate ceilings  or rate sensitive assets are funded by longer term fixed rate liabilities in a decreasing rate environment 
an institution might use various techniques to minimize irr 
one approach used by the company is to analyze its assets and liabilities and make future financing and investment decisions based on payment streams  interest rates  contractual maturities  and estimate sensitivity to actual or potential market interest rate changes 
such activities fall under the broad definition of asset liability management 
the company s primary asset liability management technique is the measurement of its asset liability gap which is defined as the difference between the cash flow amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced over a given time period 
for example  if the asset amount to be repriced exceeds the corresponding liability amount subject to repricing for a given day  month  year  or longer period  the institution is in an asset sensitive gap position 
in this situation  net interest income would increase if market interest rates rose and conversely decrease if market interest rates fell 
alternatively  if more liabilities than assets will reprice  the institution is in a liability sensitive position 
accordingly  net interest income would decline when rates rose and improve when rates fell 
also  these examples assume that interest rate changes for assets and liabilities are of the same magnitude  whereas actual interest rate changes generally differ in magnitude for assets and liabilities 
several ways an institution can manage irr include selling existing assets or repaying certain liabilities  matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities for example by  shortening terms of new loans or investments  and hedging existing assets  liabilities  or anticipated transactions 
an institution might also invest in more complex financial instruments intended to hedge or otherwise change irr 
interest rate swaps  futures contracts  options on futures  and other such derivative financial instruments are often used for this purpose 
because these instruments are sensitive to interest rate changes  they require management expertise to be effective 
sfsc has not purchased derivative financial instruments in the past 
financial institutions are also subject to prepayment risk in falling interest rate environments 
for example  mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at new  lower interest rates 
prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce the company s interest income and overall asset yields 
certain portions of an institution s liabilities may be short term or due on demand  while most of its assets may be invested in long term loans or investments 
accordingly  the company seeks to have in place sources of cash to meet short term demands 
these funds can be obtained by increasing deposits  borrowing  or selling assets 
federal home loan bank advances and short term borrowings provide additional sources of liquidity for the company 
sfsc also has a million line of credit available through a third party financial institution 
the following table sets forth information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the company had no derivative financial instruments  or trading portfolio  as of that date 
the expected maturity date values for loans  receivable  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities were calculated adjusting the underlying instrument s contractual maturity date for prepayment expectations 
expected maturity date values for interest bearing core deposits were not based upon estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  but rather the opportunity for repricing 
similarly  with respect to its variable rate instruments  the company believes that repricing dates  as opposed to maturity dates are more relevant in analyzing the value of such instruments and are reported as such in the following table 
company borrowings are also reported based on conversion or repricing dates
