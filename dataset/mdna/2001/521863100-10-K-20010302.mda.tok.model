overview leap is a wireless communications carrier that is providing innovative  affordable  simple wireless services designed to accelerate the transformation of wireless service into a mass consumer product 
we generally seek to address a much broader population segment than traditional wireless providers have addressed to date 
in the us  we are offering wireless service under the brand name cricket tm 
our innovative cricket strategy is designed to extend the benefits of mobility to the mass market by offering wireless service that is as simple to understand and use as  and priced competitively with  traditional landline service 
in each of our markets  we are deploying digital  code division multiple access  or cdma  networks that we believe provide higher capacity and more efficient deployment of capital than competing technologies 
this  when combined with our efforts to streamline operation and distribution systems  allows us to be a low cost provider of wireless services in each of our markets 
cricket service allows customers to make and receive virtually unlimited calls within a local calling area for a low  flat monthly rate compared with traditional wireless services 
cricket customers pay in advance each month s service from a simple  straightforward bill 
we offer cricket service without a contract  and because service is paid in advance  we currently require no credit check 
the simplicity of the cricket service allows us to sustain lower operating costs per customer compared to traditional wireless providers 
our networks are designed and built to provide coverage in the local calling area where our target customers live  work and play 
as a result  we believe that our network operating costs are less than those of traditional wireless providers 
at the end of  we had launched cricket service in markets covering a total population of approximately million and had more than  cricket customers across the us to date we have acquired or have rights to acquire wireless licenses covering approximately million potential customers in states  and we plan to continue launching new cricket markets throughout and beyond 
we currently plan to expand our service offerings to include wireless data services designed to appeal to a broad segment of the population and further transform the nature of wireless communications for our customers 
we believe that wireless data services  like our innovative cricket service  need to be simple  easy to use and affordable for all consumers 
in furtherance of our objective to offer low cost wireless data services  we completed our first purchase of wireless data technology in december through the acquisition of myaladdin 
com  a proprietary  personalized  location based technology  and we are planning further acquisitions in this area 
in mexico  we were a founding shareholder and have invested million in pegaso telecomunicaciones  sa de sa  a company that is providing a wireless service in mexico that is more traditional than our cricket service 
pegaso holds wireless licenses covering all of mexico  representing approximately million potential customers 
at the end of  pegaso had approximately  customers 
we currently own of pegaso 
while we expect our emphasis for the next few years will be on our us based operations  if presented with attractive opportunities  we may invest in international markets where we believe the combination of unfulfilled demand and our attractive wireless service offerings can fuel rapid growth 
as is typical for start up telecommunications networks  we expect our networks in each of our markets to incur operating expenses significantly in excess of revenues in their initial period of operation 
operating losses are likely to continue for the next several years as we rapidly expand service in new markets and seek to increase our customer bases in new and existing markets 
we believe  however  that with our simple  easy to understand approach to wireless  we can attract new customers more quickly  maintain lower customer acquisition costs  and sustain lower operating costs per customer compared to traditional wireless providers  which will allow us to generate profits in each of our markets sooner than is typical for a start up wireless provider 
recent and pending acquisitions chase telecommunications in march  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of chase telecommunications holdings  inc  including its wireless licenses 
the purchase price included approximately million in cash  the assumption of principal amounts of liabilities that totaled approximately million with a fair market value of approximately million  a warrant now exercisable to purchase  shares of leap common stock at an aggregate exercise price of million  and contingent earn out payments of up to million plus certain expenses based on earnings of the business acquired during the fifth full year following the closing of the acquisition 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total estimated fair value of the acquisition was million  of which million was allocated to property and equipment and other assets and million was allocated to intangible assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of wireless licenses  which are to be amortized over their estimated useful lives of years following commencement of commercial service 
wireless licenses leap acquired licenses in the federal government s reauction of broadband pcs spectrum licenses for million in cash 
from january through february  we completed the purchase of additional licenses in the us from various third parties for an aggregate of million in cash   shares of our common stock that had an aggregate fair value at the time of purchase of million and the assumption of million in debt  net of discount  owed to the fcc related to the licenses 
in november  we entered into an agreement with centurytel  inc to purchase wireless licenses in various markets in exchange for million in cash and promissory notes in the aggregate face amount of million payable with interest at the rate of per annum in quarterly installments  with million due days after close and the final payment due one year after close 
in addition  from january through february  we entered into various agreements with third parties to purchase additional wireless licenses in exchange for an aggregate of cash  shares of common stock and the assumption of fcc debt with an aggregate estimated fair value of million as of february   subject to certain adjustments based upon changes in the market value of wireless licenses and the market price of our common stock at the time of closing of some acquisitions 
each of the pending agreements is subject to customary closing conditions  including fcc approval  and may not be closed on schedule or at all 
we were also the high bidder on wireless licenses in the fcc s broadband pcs auction completed in january for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the transfer of these licenses to leap remains subject to fcc approval 
see the section entitled risk factors the fcc s decision that we are qualified to hold c block and f block licenses is subject to review and appeal included elsewhere in this report

we began fully consolidating smartcom s results of operations in june  having previously accounted for our investment in smartcom under the equity method of accounting

one of the promissory notes is subject to a one year right of set off to secure the indemnification obligations of leap and inversiones under the share purchase agreement between the parties 
another of the promissory notes is subject to adjustment based upon an audit of the closing balance sheet of smartcom completed following the closing of the agreement 
the final audit is not yet completed  and we are in discussions with endesa concerning a potential adjustment  which we do not expect to be material 
in february  we sold the third note which had an original principal amount of million to a third party for million including accrued interest 
each of the two remaining promissory notes matures on june  and bears interest at a rate equal to the month libor  compounded semi annually 
in addition  the sale of the smartcom shares resulted in the removal of approximately million of smartcom liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognized a gain on sale of smartcom of million before related income tax expense of million 
presentation change in fiscal year on july   our board of directors elected to change leap s fiscal year from a year ending on august to a year ending on december the first new twelve month fiscal year ended on december  as a result of the change in year end  we issued consolidated financial statements as of december  and for the period from september  to december  foreign subsidiaries to accommodate the different fiscal periods of leap and its foreign subsidiaries  we have historically recognized our share of net earnings or losses of such foreign companies on a two month lag 
in conjunction with leap s change in fiscal year end  this lag was extended to three months beginning in the period from september  to december  the effect of this change on previously reported amounts was adjusted in accumulated deficit in the period from september  to december  the financial statements of smartcom are included in our consolidated financial statements from june  to march  as a result of our acquisition of the remaining of smartcom that we did not already own in april and our sale of of smartcom on june  the accounts of smartcom were consolidated using a three month lag  and as a result of the sale in june  the results of smartcom for april and may have been reflected in accumulated deficit during the year ended december  due to the sale of smartcom  our reported results are not indicative of future results 
as we currently own of pegaso  we account for our interest in pegaso under the equity method of accounting 
revenues and cost recognition for our domestic cricket business  revenues include wireless voice services and the sale of handsets and accessories

sales incentives offered without charge to customers related to the sale of handsets are recognized as a reduction of revenue when the related equipment revenue is recognized 
customers have the right to return handsets and accessories within days of purchase or minutes of usage  whichever occurs first 
we record an estimate for returns at the time of recognizing revenue 
returns have historically been insignificant 
we sell our handsets to customers and resellers at prices below cost

at december   customers of our cricket service rose to more than  compared to approximately  at december  we added over  customers in the fourth quarter of  many in the month of december due to the launch of four new markets covering approximately million potential customers and our offering of rebates and holiday sales promotions 
we estimate these rebates and promotions resulted in a reduction of equipment revenues of approximately million 
we calculate cost per gross additional customer cpga by including all distribution costs such as advertising  all marketing and sales expenses including corporate costs  as well as handset subsidies 
in the fourth quarter of  our cpga was approximately  including all pre launch marketing expenses associated with the launch of our new markets as well as holiday promotional activities

interest under our senior notes  senior discount notes and vendor facilities is either deferred and added to principal or otherwise paid from our restricted cash and restricted investment accounts 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon whether we purchase additional wireless licenses  the progress of the buildout of our networks and other factors  including unforeseen delays  cost overruns  unanticipated expenses  regulatory expenses  engineering design changes and other technological risks 
as of december   we had a total of approximately  million in unused capital resources for our future cash needs as follows approximately million in consolidated unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  investments and deposits on hand  approximately million of proceeds net of taxes and reserves from the notes receivable received from the sale of smartcom  and approximately  million in commitments net of capitalized interest under vendor financing arrangements with lucent technologies  inc  nortel networks  inc

under a common stock purchase agreement with acqua wellington we entered into in december according to our estimates  we believe we have sufficient capital resources to build and launch networks and fund operating losses in markets with approximately million total potential customers 
our networks in these markets are expected to cover approximately million potential customers 
if we launch additional markets  invest in any new voice or data services or ventures or make additional license purchases for cash  we will need to raise substantial additional capital 
although we expect some of our markets to be cash flow positive during  we expect to incur significant operating losses and to generate significant negative cash flow from operating activities in the future while we continue to build out our networks and build our customer base 
our ability to satisfy our debt repayment obligations and covenants depends upon our future performance  which is subject to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities to meet our debt service and working capital requirements 
we plan to refinance our vendor indebtedness when market conditions are attractive 
however  our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on  among other things  our financial condition  the state of the public and private debt and equity markets  the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness and other factors  some of which may be beyond our control 
in addition  if we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service requirements or if we fail to comply with the covenants governing our indebtedness  we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness 
we may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
we expect that we will require significant additional financing over the next several years to substantially complete the buildout of our planned wireless networks in the us  the planned acquisition of additional licenses and the buildout of markets related to those additional licenses 
these capital requirements include license acquisition costs  capital expenditures for network construction  operating cash flow losses and other working capital costs  debt service and closing fees and expenses 
as is typical for start up wireless communications networks  we expect our networks to incur operating expenses significantly in excess of revenues in their early years of operations 
we are exploring other public and private debt and equity financing alternatives  including the sale from time to time of convertible preferred stock  convertible debentures and other debt and equity securities 
however  we may not be able to raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all

in december  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
under which we may  at our discretion  sell registered common stock from time to time over the succeeding month period 
under the agreement  we may require acqua wellington to purchase between and million of common stock  depending on the market price of our common stock  during one or more trading day periods 
in addition  we may grant to acqua wellington an option to purchase up to an equal amount of common stock during the same trading day period 
acqua wellington purchases the common stock at a discount to its then current market price  ranging from to  depending on our market capitalization at the time we require acqua wellington to purchase our common stock

repayment is weighted to the later years of the repayment schedule 
we plan to refinance these loans when market conditions are attractive  however  we may not be able to refinance these loans at that time 
at december   cricket communications had million outstanding under the vendor credit agreements  at a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  at december   we had amounts payable to the vendors that will be financed under the vendor credit agreements of million  which have been included in other long term liabilities 
because leap s new cricket markets were launched later in the fourth quarter of than anticipated and because of reduced equipment sales revenues as a result of holiday promotions  cricket revenue was below the minimum required level contained in the financial covenants in the vendor loan facilities 
leap has received waivers of its failure to meet this revenue target from all of the required lenders 
we expect to make up this revenue shortfall and to be in compliance with the revenue covenant by the end of the first quarter of there can be no assurance that additional delays in market launches and or other adverse results in our business will not result in a failure to meet our financial or operating covenants in the future 
qualcomm term loan 
in january  we entered into a secured loan agreement with qualcomm under which qualcomm will loan to us approximately million to finance our acquisition of wireless licenses in the fcc s broadband pcs auction completed in january qualcomm has agreed to fund borrowings under the agreement by the transfer to us of an fcc auction discount voucher  or  at qualcomm s option  cash 
under the terms of the agreement  we must repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest to qualcomm in a single payment no later than five years after the date of the initial borrowing 
the loan is subject to mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances  including as a result of our receiving net cash proceeds in excess of million from issuances of debt or equity securities by leap or its subsidiaries other than certain excluded issuances such as equipment vendor financing  and sales under the acqua wellington common stock purchase agreement which are used to acquire wireless licenses 
the loan bears interest at a variable rate depending on the collateral we provide 
we expect this rate to be at libor plus 
as security for the loan  we have agreed to pledge in favor of qualcomm the stock of subsidiaries holding licenses acquired in the january fcc auction with an aggregate purchase price of at least of the outstanding principal amount of the loan 
the loan is subject to the same covenants that are contained in the indenture for the high yield notes issued in our february units offering  and other customary covenants and conditions

in may  pegaso entered into a loan agreement with several banks with credit support from qualcomm 
we guaranteed of pegaso s obligations under the initial commitment from the lenders of million 
in connection with the guarantee  leap has received an option to subscribe for and purchase limited voting series n treasury shares of pegaso

the options have an exercise price of per share and expire years from the date of issuance 
the options are exercisable at any time after the date on which all amounts under the loan agreement are paid in full 
at december   the maximum amount of the loan had been increased to approximately million although the amount of our guarantee was not increased 
operating activities we used million in cash for operating activities during the year ended december  compared to million in the corresponding period of the prior year

we used million in cash for operating activities during the four month period ended december   compared to million in the corresponding period of the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to our net loss  as well as the effect of the full consolidation of smartcom

inflation inflation has had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of emerging market countries and could have negative effects on our foreign subsidiaries and any new start up projects in foreign countries  including their ability to obtain financing 
mexico  for example  has periodically experienced relatively high rates of inflation 
we expect that our foreign subsidiaries  where permitted and subject to competitive pressures  would increase their tariffs to account for the effects of inflation 
however  in those jurisdictions where tariff rates are regulated or specified in the wireless license  they may not successfully mitigate the impact of inflation on their operations 
future accounting requirements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for our year ending december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
which amended sfas no 
for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 all derivatives must be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair value 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency fluctuation and foreign exchange market risk 
we report our financial statements in us dollars 
pegaso reports its results in mexican pesos 
consequently  fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the mexican peso may affect our results of operations as well as the value of our ownership interest in pegaso 
generally  pegaso generates revenues that are paid in mexican pesos  but its major contracts  including financing agreements and contracts with equipment suppliers  are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  a significant change in the value of the us dollar against the mexican peso could result in a significant increase in its expenses and could have a material adverse effect on pegaso and on us 
in some emerging markets  including mexico  significant devaluations of the local currency have occurred and may occur again in the future 
leap has accrued for taxes payable to the chilean government denominated in chilean pesos related to its june sale of smartcom 
this liability is subject to the effects of currency fluctuations that may affect reported earnings and losses 
a significant depreciation in the value of the us dollar against the chilean peso could result in a significant increase in our consolidated expenses 
as of december   this liability amounted to approximately million 
our results of operations would be negatively impacted by approximately million if the us dollar was to depreciate against the chilean peso by 
this hypothetical amount is only suggestive of the effect of currency fluctuations on our results of operations 
this liability is due and payable by no later than april interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate long term debt obligations 
the general level of us interest rates and or libor affect the interest expense that we recognize on our variable rate long term debt obligations 
as of december   the principal amounts of our variable rate long term debt obligations amounted to approximately million 
an increase of in interest rates would increase our interest expense for the year by approximately million 
this hypothetical amount is only suggestive of the effect of changes in interest rates on our results of operations for the year hedging policy 
as required by our vendor loan agreements  leap will maintain hedging agreements which fix or limit the interest cost to cricket communications and the leap subsidiaries that guarantee the vendor loans other than cricket communications holdings  inc to a portion of their long term indebtedness sufficient to cause of their consolidated long term indebtedness to be comprised of a combination of a indebtedness bearing interest at a fixed rate and b indebtedness covered by such hedging agreements 
other than this  leap does not have a policy to systematically hedge against foreign currency exchange rate or interest rate risks
