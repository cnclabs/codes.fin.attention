operating expenses have increased in dollar terms during the quarters presented 
sales and marketing expenses have decreased in dollar terms in the fiscal year ended as a result of a sharp reduction in advertising and a favorable adjustment to the accounting for sales commission expense due to a change in facts and circumstances 
research and development expenses increased in dollar terms as a result of expanded technological development efforts to support the launch of new services and to enhance the features and functionality of its services 
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms as a result of an increase in personnel  additional facilities  sharply higher amortization expense resulting from three acquisitions and expenses related to the issuance of warrants 
our quarterly revenues  margins and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
causes of these fluctuations have included and may include  among other factors  demand for our services  the size and timing of both new and renewal subscriptions  the number  timing and significance of new services introduced by us and our competitors  our ability to develop  market and introduce new and enhanced services on a timely basis  the level of service and price competition  changes in operating expenses  changes in the mix of services offered  changes in our sales incentive strategy  sharp declines in the volume or price levels of securities transactions and general economic factors 
any one or more of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition  and makes the prediction of results of operations on a quarterly basis unreliable 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our principal commitments consist of capital lease obligations of  net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was million in the year ended december   and million in the equivalent period in the principal use of cash for all periods was to fund our losses from operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the non us dollar 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure 
interest rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
we have no long term debt obligations 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  collection risk our accounts receivable are subject  in the normal course of business  to collection risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of collection risks 
as a result  we do not anticipate any material losses in this area 
risk factors that may affect future results multex 
com s business could be materially and adversely affected by a downturn in the financial services industry we are dependent upon the continued demand for the distribution of investment research and other information over the internet  making our business susceptible to a downturn in the financial services industry 
for example  a decrease in the number of analysts that prepare investment research reports or in the capital dedicated to the dissemination of this research could result in a decrease in the number of research reports and other financial information available for distribution and a concomitant decrease in demand by our subscribers for these reports and other information 
in addition  us financial institutions are continuing to consolidate  increasing the leverage of our information providers to negotiate price and decreasing the overall potential market for some of our services 
weakness in the financial services industry could also adversely impact our subscription and web site hosting renewal rates 
these factors  as well as other changes occurring in the financial services industry  could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
multex 
com s business would be materially and adversely affected if the market for online investment research does not continue to grow in order to be successful  we must increase our revenues from subscription fees for multexnet  from development  hosting and subscription fees for multexexpress  generate additional sales of investment research on a pay per view basis through multexnet on demand  attract more users to multex investor and increase license fees from the market guide database 
we must also integrate and increase revenues from our newly acquired subsidiaries  sage online and buzzcompany 
com 
we face risks  among others  relating to our ability to o anticipate and adapt to the changing internet market  o attract and retain more subscribers  research and data contributors  and technology and business partners  o implement our sales  marketing  and branding strategies  both domestically and internationally o attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  o respond to actions taken by our competitors  o continue to build an infrastructure to effectively manage our growth and handle any future increased usage  and o integrate acquired businesses  technologies  products  and services 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy  our business  results of operations  and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
the markets for our products and services are rapidly changing the market for the distribution of investment research and other information over the internet is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed electronic investment research distribution services over public and private networks  online services and the internet 
as is typical of a rapidly evolving market  demand and market acceptance for new services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
because the market for our services is still relatively new and rapidly evolving  it is difficult to predict with any degree of assurance the growth rate  if any  and the ultimate size  of this market 
we cannot assure you that the market for our services will continue to grow or that our services will ever achieve significant market acceptance 
if the market for our services weakens  grows or develops more slowly than expected  or becomes saturated with competitors  if our services do not achieve increased market acceptance  or if pricing becomes subject to significant competitive pressures  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
multex 
com s business could be materially and adversely affected by pressures of competition the market for the distribution of investment research and other information over the internet is intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase 
competition also may increase as a result of industry consolidation 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we currently face direct and indirect competition for both providers of investment research and other reports  and for subscribers  including with large and well established distributors of financial information  such as thomson financial services through its subsidiaries first call  investext and i b e s 
some of our competitors enjoy exclusive distribution arrangements with major financial institutions 
we also compete with o companies that provide investment research  including investment banks and brokerage firms  many of whom have their own web sites and potentially consortia of such firms  o other providers of either free or subscription research services on the internet  o services provided by some of our strategic distributors which are competitive in one or more respects with our service offerings  o numerous prospective competitors  including standard poor s  mergent  and zacks investment research  that offer investment research based services  o various written publications  including traditional media  investment newsletters  personal financial magazines and industry research appearing in financial periodicals  o services provided by in house management information services personnel and independent systems integrators  o annual reports and other filings with the securities and exchange commission  o standard poor s company specific reports  and o value line investment research reports 
if we fail to successfully compete with these entities or information sources  our business  results of operations  and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
rapid growth in multex 
com s future operations could strain our managerial  operational and financial resources we have experienced rapid growth in our operations 
this rapid growth has placed  and our anticipated future growth will continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources  that if not properly managed  could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the loss of any of multex 
com s key personnel could have a material and adverse effect our future success will depend  in substantial part  on the continued service of our senior management  including mr 
isaak karaev  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and key technical and sales personnel  none of whom has entered into an employment agreement with us other than a non competition non disclosure agreement 
we maintain a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million on the life of mr 
karaev 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
multex 
com s international operations are still new and may not be successful 
we have only limited business experience outside of the united states we have only recently commenced operations in a number of international markets and a key component of our strategy is to continue to expand our international operations 
to date  we have only limited experience in developing and obtaining research and other financial information relating to companies whose securities are traded on foreign markets and in marketing  selling and distributing our services internationally 
the failure to gain the necessary experience  hire appropriate personnel  and enter into key business relationships in these markets could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
doing business internationally subjects us to additional regulatory requirements  tax liabilities and other risks there are risks inherent in doing business in international markets  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  export restrictions and controls  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and various other parts of the world  any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the success of our international operations and  consequently  on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that governmental regulatory agencies in one or more foreign countries will not determine that the services provided by us constitute the provision of investment advice  which could result in our having to register in these countries as an investment advisor or in our having to cease selling our services in these countries  either of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because multex 
com s business is dependent upon network and computer systems located in one area  we are susceptible to problems caused by natural disasters  power failures  system failures  security breaches or other damage to our system our electronic distribution of investment research utilizes proprietary technology that resides principally in new york city 
the continued and uninterrupted performance of our network and computer systems is critical to our success 
any disaster  power outage or system failure that causes interruptions in our ability to provide our services to our customers  including failures that affect our ability to collect research from our information providers or provide electronic investment research to our users  could reduce customer satisfaction and  if sustained or repeated  would reduce the attractiveness of our services 
an increase in the volume of research reports handled by our systems  or in the rate of requests for this research  could strain the capacity of our software or hardware  which could lead to slower response times or system failures 
furthermore  we face the risk of a security breach of our systems that could disrupt the distribution of research and other reports and information 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if any of these problems occur 
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our network and computer systems against damage from computer viruses  fire  power loss  data communications failures  vandalism and other malicious acts  and similar unexpected adverse events 
in addition  a failure of our communications providers to provide the data communications capacity in the time frame required by us for any reason could cause interruptions in the delivery of our services 
despite precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  delays and interruptions in the delivery of our services 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover any claims by dissatisfied providers or subscribers or may not be adequate to indemnify us for any liability that may be imposed in the event that a claim were brought against us 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any system failure  security breach or other damage that interrupts or delays our operations 
the market price of our shares may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations
