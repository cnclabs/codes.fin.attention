item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance 
our actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
in addition  subsequent events and developments may cause our expectations to change 
while we may elect to update these forward looking statements we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so  even if our expectations change 
see factors affecting future operating results below 
overview we develop  manufacture and market an anesthesia monitoring system that we call the bis system 
the bis system enables anesthesia providers to assess and manage a patient s level of consciousness during surgery 
our proprietary bis system includes our bis monitor or bis module kit and our disposable bis sensors 
the bis system is based on our patented core technology  the bis index 
our latest generation monitor  the a bis monitor  was cleared for marketing by the fda in february our other monitor products are the a monitor  the a eeg monitor with bis and the bis module kit 
after the introduction of the a bis monitor  we ceased active marketing of the a eeg monitor domestically 
in addition to the disposable bis sensor  we offer the zipprep eeg electrode 
we follow a system of fiscal months as opposed to calendar months 
under this system  the first eleven months of each fiscal year end on the saturday closest to the end of the calendar month and the last month of the fiscal year always ends on december we offer customers the option either to purchase the bis monitors outright or to acquire the bis monitors pursuant to a sales type lease agreement whereby the customer contractually commits to purchase a minimum number of bis sensors per bis monitor per year 
under this agreement  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
the customer is granted an option to purchase the bis monitor at the end of the term of the agreement  which is typically three to five years 
revenue related to bis monitors sold pursuant to sales type leases is recognized at the time of shipment of the bis monitors 
sales type leases accounted for approximately  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
under certain circumstances  we also offer customers the opportunity to use the bis monitors under our equipment placement program  which we refer to as the ep program 
under the ep program  the customer receives the right to use the bis monitors for a mutually agreed upon period of time 
during this period  the customer purchases bis sensors at a price that includes a premium above the list price of the bis sensors to cover the rental of the equipment  but without any minimum purchase commitments 
at the end of the evaluation period  the customer has the option of purchasing the bis monitors or returning them to us 
in the three months ended december   revenue from the sale of monitors increased by and revenue from the sale of disposable sensors increased by as compared to the three months ended september  in comparison  revenue from the sale of monitors decreased by and revenue from the sale of disposable sensors decreased by in the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended july  in the fourth quarter  we introduced a variety of sales and marketing programs to increase sales of our products 
factors that we believe contributed to the increasingly competitive environment include increased competition in the domestic level of consciousness monitoring market as a result of recent fda approval of a new monitoring system  turnover in our direct sales force and our underestimating the amount of clinical education necessary to bring our installed base up to expected sensor utilization levels 
the sales and marketing programs we introduced in the fourth quarter of include new sales programs to facilitate monitor placements  such as the ep program 
we also increased investments in clinical education in an effort to return to higher and more consistent sensor utilization rates 
even with the introduction of new sales and marketing programs and continued increased investment in clinical education  we believe that the factors that adversely affected our revenue for the third and fourth quarters of will continue to influence our revenue in we derive our revenue primarily from sales of monitors  including related accessories and bis module kits  and sales of disposable sensors 
in  and  revenue from the sale of monitors represented approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue  and revenue from the sale of disposable sensors represented approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue 
we expect that revenue from the sale of disposable sensors will continue to increase as a percentage of revenue as the installed base of monitors continues to grow 
revenue from domestic sales in  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  which represented approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue 
revenue from international sales in  and was approximately million  million and  respectively  which represented approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue 
effective july   our agreement with spacelabs medical  inc to distribute our monitors internationally  except in japan  was terminated pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
sales to spacelabs represented approximately and of our international revenue in and  respectively  and substantially all of our revenue from international sales in in december and march  we established subsidiaries in the netherlands and the united kingdom  respectively  to facilitate our entry into the international market 
we are developing our international sales and distribution program through a combination of distributors and marketing partners  including companies with which we have entered into original equipment manufacturer relationships 
we expect to enhance our international third party distribution program through direct sales efforts and to support our customers with clinical specialists 
in january  we entered into a distribution agreement with nihon kohden corporation to distribute bis monitors in japan 
in march  the japanese ministry of health and welfare approved our a eeg monitor with bis for marketing in japan 
sales to nihon kohden represented approximately of international revenue in and of international revenue in each of and we believe that japan s ministry of health and welfare approval for the a bis monitor will occur no earlier than the first quarter of as a result  we believe that monitor shipments to nihon kohden will be delayed until japan s ministry of health and welfare s approval is received as japanese customers will postpone new purchases until the a bis monitor is approved 
as a result  revenue from japan may decrease in until approval is received 
effective september   we entered into an agreement with datex ohmeda division of instrumentarium corporation  under which datex ohmeda has agreed to act as a nonexclusive distributor of our a bis monitor and related products in some territories 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of revenue 
this information has been derived from our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this form k 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any period 
year ended december  revenue costs and expenses costs of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income  net other expense net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
revenue from the sale of monitors increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
the growth in revenue from the sale of monitors in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in the number of monitors sold  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of the monitors 
there were two primary factors that contributed to the minimal increase in revenue from monitor sales in as compared to first  as a result of the recent fda approval of a competitive monitoring product  in the second half of more customers than we expected have elected to delay purchase decisions until they have had an opportunity to evaluate the competitive product 
second  during the second and third quarters of we experienced higher than anticipated turnover in our direct sales force 
we underestimated the impact that this turnover in our direct sales force would have on our sales effort 
the development of our domestic distributor channel and the contribution of our international organization offset these factors that negatively affected our monitor revenue 
revenue from the sale of disposable sensors increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in revenue from the sale of disposable sensors was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of disposable sensors sold as a result of growth in the installed base of monitors 
the number of disposable sensors sold increased approximately in as compared to our gross profit was approximately of revenue in as compared to a gross profit of approximately of revenue in the increase in the gross profit percentage in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of disposable sensors as a percentage of revenue 
disposable sensors have a higher profit margin than monitors and contributed almost all of the increase in gross profit in as compared to we expect that sales of higher margin disposable sensors  as a percentage of revenue  will continue to represent the majority of our sales as the installed base of monitors continues to grow and we continue to increase our investments in clinical education in an effort to enhance use of the monitors  and accordingly  to grow sensor volume and revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue in as compared to the increase in research and development expenses for as compared to  was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development personnel and related payroll and other expenses 
these expenses were incurred in connection with the continued product development efforts related to the a bis monitor  bis sensor plus  bis sensor xp  bis pediatric sensor and bis module kit and the development of products for use outside the operating room in the intensive care unit and for procedural sedation 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in the development of product improvements  product extensions and new applications for our technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
sales and marketing expenses remained the same as a percentage of revenue for as compared to the increase in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing personnel and related payroll and other expenses  which represented approximately of the increase  increased operating expenses associated with our international subsidiaries  which represented approximately of the increase  and fees and commissions related to the agreements with group purchasing organizations  oems and distributors  which represented approximately of the increase 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to expand our international operations  leverage the relationships with group purchasing organizations we entered into in the second half of and enter into additional relationships with group purchasing organizations and  increase our sales and marketing programs and engage in activities to further educate and promote the use of the bis system by our customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
general and administrative expenses remained the same as a percentage of revenue for as compared to the increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative personnel to support our growth and related payroll and other expenses  which represented approximately of the increase 
the increase in payroll and other expenses included compensation expense related to stock option grants  which increased approximately in as compared to the increase also included incremental expenses related to being a public company  such as expenses related to enhancements of our investor relations capabilities and insurance expenses  which represented approximately of the increase 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we increase the number of personnel and related resources required to support our growth 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
interest income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to a higher average balance of cash and investments resulting from our initial public offering of common stock and the proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investment in sales type leases 
interest expense increased to approximately  in from approximately  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in interest expense in was a result of higher average outstanding debt obligations resulting from borrowings under a term loan we entered into in december and debt obligations related to the sale of a portion of our investments in sales type leases in the second half of and throughout we expect interest income to decrease in as compared to the interest income in as a result of lower cash and investments balances resulting from continued operating losses and other uses of cash 
net loss 
as a result of the factors discussed above  in we had a net loss of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million in  a decrease of approximately 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
revenue from the sale of monitors increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
the growth in revenue from the sale of monitors was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in the number of monitors sold  which resulted from the growth of our direct sales force and the contribution of our international organization 
in addition  sales of the bis module kit  which was introduced in the second half of  contributed to the increase in monitor revenue 
revenue from the sale of disposable sensors increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in revenue from the sale of disposable sensors was primarily attributable to growth in the installed base of monitors  which resulted in an increase of approximately in the number of disposable sensors sold 
an increase of approximately in the average selling price of the disposable sensors also contributed to the increase in revenue 
our gross profit was approximately of revenue in as compared to a gross profit of approximately of revenue in the increase in the gross profit percentage in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of disposable sensors as a percentage of revenue 
disposable sensors have a higher profit margin than monitors and contributed approximately of the increase in gross profit 
the increase in the gross profit percentage in also resulted from improved manufacturing efficiencies 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development personnel and related payroll and other expenses  which represented approximately of the increase 
these expenses were incurred in connection with the continued product development efforts related to the a bis monitor  bis sensor and bis module kit and the development of products for use outside the operating room in the intensive care unit and for procedural sedation 
sales and marketing

other expense in primarily related to the costs incurred in a proposed initial public offering  which was terminated in august net loss 
our net loss decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in  a decrease of approximately  as a result of the factors discussed above 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited selected operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the two fiscal years ended december  we believe that the following selected quarterly information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal  recurring adjustments that we consider necessary to present this information fairly 
this financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
therefore  results of operations for any previous periods are not necessarily indicative of results of operations to be recorded in the future

        net income loss       liquidity and capital resources from our inception through january  we financed our operations primarily from the sale of our convertible preferred stock 
through december   we raised approximately million from private equity financings and have received approximately million in equipment financing and approximately million of financing related to our investments in sales type leases 
we also received approximately million of financing under a term loan in december in february  we closed our initial public offering of an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had approximately  primarily committed to the purchase of equipment related to improvements in our monitor and disposable sensor production lines 
working capital at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the increase in working capital from december  to december  was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from our initial public offering of million and increases in inventory of approximately million and other current assets of approximately  offset by continued net operating losses of approximately million  a decrease in net accounts receivable of approximately  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately  we used approximately million of cash for operations in cash used for operations during this period was primarily driven by operating losses  increases in inventory and other current assets and a decrease in deferred revenue  offset by decreases in net accounts receivable  investment in sales type leases and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we used approximately million for operations during the three years ended december  cash used for operations during this period was also primarily driven by operating losses  increases in net accounts receivable  inventory  investment in sales type leases and other current assets  offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
we used approximately million of cash for investing activities in the cash used for investing activities in was primarily the result of the investment of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering of common stock 
we invested approximately million  net  in marketable securities and invested approximately million primarily in manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements for our new facility 
we used approximately million for investing activities during the three years ended december  we invested approximately million  net  in marketable securities and approximately million in manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and new information systems during the three years ended december  we received approximately million of cash from financing activities in primarily as a result of the closing of our initial public offering of common stock and the sale of approximately million of our investments in sales type leases offset by approximately million of debt repayments 
we received approximately million of cash from financing activities during the three years ended december  cash provided by financing activities during this period was primarily the result of the closing of our initial public offering  the sale of our convertible preferred stock  proceeds from our equipment loan and term loan and the sale of a portion of our investments in sales type leases in the three year period ended december  in december  we renegotiated our loan agreement with imperial bank 
borrowings outstanding at december  of approximately  under the equipment portion of the new loan agreement are payable in monthly installments of approximately  plus interest through december  the working capital portion of the original june loan agreement was replaced with a term loan portion 
borrowings under the term loan portion outstanding at december  of approximately million are payable in monthly installments of approximately  plus interest which commenced in january interest on both the equipment portion and the term loan portion of the loan agreement accrued at the prime rate plus through the closing date of our initial public offering of common stock 
since the closing of our initial public offering  the interest rate has been the prime rate plus 
the loan agreement contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain liquidity and borrowing base ratios 
the loan agreement also restricts us from declaring and paying cash dividends 
the loan agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets 
no additional amounts may be borrowed under the equipment portion or term loan portion of the loan agreement 
approximately million is available under the standby letter of credit portion of the loan agreement 
in july  we entered into an agreement under which we can sell a portion of our existing and future investments in sales type leases to americorp financial  inc through december   we sold approximately million of our investments in sales type leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  the proceeds from these sales are classified as debt 
payments on the outstanding principal under this debt match the timing of the payments due on the underlying investments in sales type leases 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures will decrease in as a result of the completion of the leasehold improvements to our newton  massachusetts facility in we believe that the financial resources available to us  including our current working capital  together with the proceeds from selling our investments in sales type leases  will be sufficient to finance our planned operations and capital expenditures at least through however  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the resources required to further develop our marketing and sales organization domestically and internationally  to expand manufacturing capacity  to finance our sales type lease program and ep program and to meet market demand for our products 
income taxes we have net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively  at december  that will expire commencing in the year through the year if not utilized 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards are subject to review by the internal revenue service 
ownership changes  as defined under section in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of these tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or on our results of operations 
conversion to euro eleven of the members of the european union have agreed to adopt the euro as their legal currency 
our current information systems allow us to currently process euro denominated transactions 
we are also assessing the business implications of the conversion to the euro  including long term competitive implications and the effect of market risk with respect to financial instruments 
substantially all of our international sales are denominated in united states dollars 
we do not believe the euro will have a significant effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we will continue to assess the impact of euro conversion issues as the applicable accounting  tax  legal and regulatory guidance evolves 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
most of our revenue  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars 
however  the expenses and capital spending of our international subsidiaries are transacted in local currency 
as a result  changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could affect our financial results 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalent balances  marketable securities  investment in sales type leases and loan agreement 
the majority of our investments are in short term instruments and subject to fluctuations in us interest rates 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure

factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements  including information relating to our ability to achieve profitability  information with respect to market acceptance of our bis system  continued growth in sales of our bis monitors and bis sensors  our dependence on the bis system  our ability to remain competitive and achieve future growth  information with respect to other plans and strategies for our business and factors that may influence our revenue for the year ended december  the following factors represent current challenges to us that create risk and uncertainty 
failure to adequately overcome any of the following challenges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  business or financial condition 
we will not be profitable if hospitals and anesthesia providers do not buy and use our bis system in sufficient quantities 
customers may determine that the cost of the bis system exceeds cost savings in drugs  personnel and post anesthesia care recovery resulting from use of the bis system 
in addition  hospitals and anesthesia providers may not accept the bis system as an accurate means of assessing a patient s level of consciousness during surgery 
if extensive or frequent malfunctions occur  these providers may also conclude that the bis system is unreliable 
if hospitals and anesthesia providers do not accept the bis system as cost effective  accurate or reliable  they will not buy and use the bis system in sufficient quantities to enable us to be profitable 
we depend on our bis system for substantially all of our revenue  and if the bis system does not gain widespread market acceptance  then our revenue will not grow 
we began selling our current bis system in early to date  we have not achieved widespread market acceptance of the bis system 
because we depend on our bis system for substantially all of our revenue and we have no other significant products  if we fail to achieve widespread market acceptance we will not be able to sustain or grow our product revenue 
cases of surgical awareness during monitoring with the bis system could limit market acceptance of bis systems and could expose us to product liability claims 
clinicians have reported to us a total of cases of possible surgical awareness during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system as of december  in most of the cases that were reported to us  when bis index values were recorded at the time of awareness  high bis index values were noted  indicating that the bis index correctly identified the increased risk of awareness in these patients 
however  in a small number of these reported cases  surgical awareness may not have been detected by monitoring with the bis system 
not all cases of surgical awareness during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system may be reported to us  and we have not systematically solicited reports of surgical awareness 
anesthesia providers and hospitals may elect not to purchase and use bis systems if there is adverse publicity resulting from the report of cases of surgical awareness that were not detected during procedures monitored with the bis system 
if anesthesia providers and hospitals do not purchase and use the bis system  then we may not sustain or grow our product revenue 
although we do not claim that patient monitoring with the bis system will reduce the incidence of surgical awareness  we may be subject to product liability claims for cases of surgical awareness during surgical procedures monitored with the bis system 
these claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
we may not be able to compete with new products or alternative techniques developed by others  which could impair our ability to remain competitive and achieve future growth 
the medical industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances 
our revenue in the second half of was adversely affected by commercial introduction of a recently fda approved competitive anesthesia monitoring product 
if we do not compete effectively with this new monitoring product  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our current or planned products are at risk of obsolescence from other new monitoring products  based on new or improved technologies  new products or technologies used on patients or in the operating room during surgery in lieu of monitoring devices  electrical or mechanical interference from new or existing products or technologies  alternative techniques for evaluating the effects of anesthesia  significant changes in the methods of delivering anesthesia  and the development of new anesthetic agents 
we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our markets and continue to grow our business 
if we do not successfully develop and introduce enhanced or new products we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
as the market for our bis system matures  we need to develop and introduce new products for anesthesia monitoring or other applications 
we face at least the following risks we may not successfully adapt the bis system to function properly in the intensive care unit  for procedural sedation  when used with anesthetics we have not tested or with patient populations we have not studied  such as infants  and our technology is complex  and we may not be able to develop it further for applications outside anesthesia monitoring 
if we do not successfully adapt the bis system for new products and applications both within and outside the field of anesthesia monitoring  then we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
if we do not develop and implement a successful sales and marketing strategy  we will not expand our business 
we recently experienced higher than anticipated turnover in our direct sales force and we underestimated the impact that this turnover in our direct sales force would have on our sales efforts 
until the newly hired sales representatives become knowledgeable about our products  customer base and sales programs  our sales efforts will be adversely affected 
in addition  our current sales and marketing operation is not sufficient to achieve the level of market awareness and sales we need to expand our business 
we have only limited sales and marketing experience both in the united states and internationally and may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategy 
we need to provide or assure that distributors and original equipment manufacturers provide the technical and educational support customers need to use the bis system successfully  promote frequent use of the bis system so that sales of our disposable bis sensors increase  encourage our customers to purchase our products or the products that are made by original equipment manufacturers incorporating our technology  manage geographically dispersed operations  and modify our products for foreign markets 
in order to reach the level of sales we need to achieve profitability  we need to further develop our direct and indirect sales channels 
in order to increase our sales  we need to add domestic and international distributors  original equipment manufacturers and other sales channels and increase sales through these channels 
in addition  we need to hire and train more sales persons and clinical specialists 
we are also implementing new sales and marketing programs and clinical education programs to promote the use of our bis system by our customers 
if we do not further develop our direct and indirect sales channels and successfully implement new sales and marketing programs and clinical education programs  we will not reach the level of sales necessary to achieve profitability 
our third party distribution and original equipment manufacturer relationships could negatively affect our profitability  cause sales of our products to decline and be difficult to terminate if we are dissatisfied 
sales through distributors could be less profitable than direct sales 
sales of our products through multiple channels could also confuse customers and cause the sale of our products to decline 
we do not control our original equipment manufacturers and distribution partners 
our partners could sell competing products  may not incorporate our technology into their products in a timely manner and may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
our partners are generally not required to purchase minimum quantities 
as a result  even if we are dissatisfied with the performance of our partners  we may be unable to terminate our agreements with these partners or enter into alternative arrangements 
we may not be able to generate enough additional revenue from our international expansion to offset the costs associated with establishing and maintaining foreign operations 
a component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence in foreign markets 
we conduct international business primarily in europe and japan and we are attempting to increase the number of countries in which we do business 
it will be costly to establish international facilities and operations and to promote the bis system in international markets 
in addition  we have little experience in marketing and distributing products for these markets 
revenue from international activities may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign operations 
we may not be able to meet the unique operational  legal and financial challenges that we will encounter in our international operations  which may limit the growth of our business 
we are increasingly subject to a number of challenges which specifically relate to our international business activities 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  less acceptance by foreign anesthesia providers of the use of disposable products similar to the bis sensor  longer sales cycles to sell products like the bis system to hospitals and outpatient surgical centers  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  our international operations may not be successful which would limit the growth of our business 
we may experience customer dissatisfaction and our reputation could suffer if we fail to manufacture enough products to meet our customers demands 
we rely on third party manufacturers to assemble and manufacture the components of our bis monitors and a portion of our bis sensors 
we manufacture substantially all bis sensors in our own manufacturing facility 
we have only one manufacturing facility 
if we fail to produce enough products at our own manufacturing facility or at a third party manufacturing facility or experience a termination or modification of any manufacturing arrangement with a third party  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our failure to deliver products on a timely basis could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
our reliance on sole suppliers could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers demands for our products in a timely manner or within budget 
some of the components that are necessary for the assembly of our bis system  including some of the components used in the bis sensor  are currently provided to us by separate sole suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
we purchase components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory 
we have experienced shortages and delays in obtaining some of the components of our bis systems in the past  and we may experience similar delays or shortages in the future 
the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components  which could affect our profitability 
a disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
furthermore  if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of the bis system  we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines 
the delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture bis systems in a timely manner or within budget 
we may be required to bring litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  which may result in substantial expense and may divert our attention from the implementation of our business strategy 
we believe that the success of our business depends  in part  on obtaining patent protection for our products  defending our patents once obtained and preserving our trade secrets 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and patent  trademark and trade secret laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal measures afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expense and diversion of our attention from the growth of the business and may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may be sued by third parties which claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of medical device patents 
we may be exposed to litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign our products  which would be costly and time consuming 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims which could divert management attention and adversely affect our cash balances  our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts and our reputation 
the manufacture and sale of our products expose us to product liability claims and product recalls  including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of  or design flaws in  our products or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured or sold by us 
product liability claims or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
we currently maintain insurance  however  it might not cover the costs of any product liability claims made against us 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
in addition  publicity pertaining to the misuse or malfunction of  or design flaws in  our products could impair our ability to successfully market and sell our products 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could cause our stock price to decrease 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
these fluctuations are due to several factors relating to the sale of our products  including the timing and volume of customer orders for our bis system  use of and demand for our bis sensors  customer cancellations  introduction of competitive products  changes in management  reductions in orders by our distribution partners and the timing and amount of our expenses 
because of these fluctuations  our operating results for the year ended december  fell below the original expectations of securities analysts or investors  and it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results could again fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if our quarterly operating results are below expectations in the future the market price of our stock would also be likely to decrease 
in addition  because we do not have a significant backlog of customer orders for our bis system  revenue in any quarter depends on orders received in that quarter 
our quarterly results may also be adversely affected because some customers may have inadequate financial resources to purchase our products or may fail to pay for our products after receiving them 
in particular  hospitals are increasingly experiencing financial constraints  consolidations and reorganizations as a result of cost containment measures and declining third party reimbursement for services  which may result in decreased product orders or an increase in bad debts in any quarter 
various market factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results during the first quarter of and for the year ending december  various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results during the first fiscal quarter of and the year ending december  we are facing increased competition in the domestic level of consciousness monitoring market as a result of recent fda approval of a new monitoring system 
second  we experienced higher than anticipated turnover in our direct sales force 
this may adversely impact our revenue for the first fiscal quarter of  depending in part on the timing of when the newly hired sales representatives become knowledgeable about our products  customer base and sales programs 
third  we underestimated the amount of clinical education necessary to bring our installed base up to expected sensor utilization levels 
we may not reserve amounts adequate to cover product obsolescence  claims and returns  which could result in unanticipated expenses and fluctuations in operating results 
depending on factors such as the timing of our introduction of new products which utilize our bis technology  as well as warranty claims and product returns  we may need to reserve amounts in excess of those currently reserved for product obsolescence  excess inventory  warranty claims and product returns 
these reserves may not be adequate to cover all costs associated with these items 
if these reserves are inadequate  we would be required to incur unanticipated expenses which could result in unexpected fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products 
we are facing increased competition in the domestic level of consciousness monitoring market as a result of recent fda approval of a new monitoring product 
this recently approved product is marketed by a well established medical products company with significant resources 
we may not be able to compete effectively with this and other potential competitors 
we may also face substantial competition from companies developing sensor products that compete with our proprietary bis sensors for use with our bis monitors or with third party monitoring systems or anesthesia delivery systems that incorporate the bis index 
we also expect to face competition from companies currently marketing conventional electroencephalogram  or eeg  monitors using standard and novel signal processing techniques 
other companies may develop anesthesia monitoring systems that perform better than the bis system and or sell for less 
in addition  one or more of our competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our fda approved products  in which case they may be able to use our products as predicate devices to more quickly obtain fda approval of their competing products 
medical device companies developing these and other competitive products may have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
competition in the sale of anesthesia monitoring systems could result in price reductions  fewer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
our ability to market and sell our products and generate revenue depends upon receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approval of our products and manufacturing operations 
before we can market new products in the united states we must obtain clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
if the fda concludes that any of our products do not meet the requirements to obtain clearance of a premarket notification under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act  then we would be required to file a premarket approval application 
the approval process for a premarket approval application is lengthy  expensive and typically requires extensive preclinical and clinical trial data 
we may not obtain clearance of a k notification or approval of a premarket approval application with respect to any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
if we fail to obtain timely clearance or approval for our products  we will not be able to market and sell our products  which will limit our ability to generate revenue 
we may also be required to obtain clearance of a k notification from the fda before we can market certain previously marketed products which we modify after they have been cleared 
we have made certain enhancements to our currently marketed products which we have determined do not necessitate the filing of a new k notification 
however  if the fda does not agree with our determination  it will require us to file a new k notification for the modification and we may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until we obtain fda clearance 
the fda also requires us to adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations  which include production design controls  testing  quality control  storage and documentation procedures 
the fda may at any time inspect our facilities to determine whether adequate compliance has been achieved 
compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations for medical devices is difficult and costly 
in addition  we may not continue to be compliant as a result of future changes in  or interpretations of  regulations by the fda or other regulatory agencies 
if we do not achieve continued compliance  the fda may withdraw marketing clearance or require product recall 
when any change or modification is made to a device or its intended use  the manufacturer may be required to reassess compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations  which may cause interruptions or delays in the marketing and sale of our products 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
the federal  state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to future changes  as are administrative interpretations of regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions  including product seizures  recalls  withdrawal of clearances or approvals and civil and criminal penalties 
if we do not retain our senior management and other key employees  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
our president and chief executive officer  nassib chamoun  joined us at our inception in our chairman  j 
breckenridge eagle  began serving as a director in many other members of our management and key employees have extensive experience with us and other companies in the medical device industry 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of these members of our senior management and other key employees 
because of their ability and experience  if we lose one or more of the members of our senior management or other key employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed 
if we do not attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 
our products are based on complex signal processing technology 
accordingly  we require skilled personnel to develop  manufacture  sell and support our products 
our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire  train  retain and motivate additional skilled personnel  particularly sales representatives and clinical specialists who are responsible for customer education and training and post installation customer support 
we continue to experience difficulty in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel because the pool of experienced persons is small and we compete for personnel with other companies  many of which have greater resources than we do 
consequently  if we are not able to attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 
failure of users of the bis system to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors could limit market acceptance of the bis system  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
anesthesia providers are generally not reimbursed separately for patient monitoring activities utilizing the bis system 
for hospitals and outpatient surgical centers  when reimbursement is based on charges or costs  patient monitoring with the bis system may reduce reimbursements for surgical procedures  because charges or costs may decline as a result of monitoring with the bis system 
failure by hospitals and other users of the bis system to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors  or any reduction in the reimbursement by third party payors to hospitals and other users as a result of using the bis system could limit market acceptance of the bis system  which could prevent us from achieving profitability
