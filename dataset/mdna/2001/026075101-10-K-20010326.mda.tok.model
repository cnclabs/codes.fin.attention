primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities  paydowns  and sales of investment and mortgage backed securities  borrowings from the federal home loan bank  and repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the primary investing activities of the company are the origination of residential one to four family mortgage loans and  to a lesser extent  multi family loans  single family construction loans  home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans and the investment in mortgage backed securities  us government and agency obligations and corporate equity securities and debt obligations

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the principal objectives of the company s interest rate risk management are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the board of director s approved guidelines 
the company has an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets monthly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the finance committee of the board of directors quarterly and the whole board of directors annually 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
in recent years  the company has used the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans and generally selling longer term fixed rate loans as market interest rate conditions dictate  emphasizing shorter term consumer loans  maintaining a high quality securities portfolio that provides adequate liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from fluctuations in market interest rates  the overall maturity of which is monitored in relation to the repricing of its loan portfolio  and using federal home loan bank advances and repurchase agreement borrowings to better structure maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the company currently does not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
the company s market risk also includes equity price risk 
the company s marketable equity securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million at december  which is included  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of the company s stockholders equity 
if equity security prices decline due to unfavorable market conditions or other factors  the company s stockholders equity would decrease 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income  incorporating various assumptions regarding the shape of the yield curve  the pricing characteristics of loans  deposits and borrowings  prepayments on loans and securities and changes in balance sheet mix 
the assumptions that have the greatest impact on the estimated changes in annual net interest income are prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and securities 
the table below sets forth  as of december  and december   estimated changes in the company s net interest income for the next twelve month period which may result given instantaneous changes in market interest rates of basis points up and down 
if interest rates were to instantaneously rise by basis points  the average constant prepayment rate the cpr assumptions on mortgage loans and securities were and on december  and december   respectively 
if interest rates were to instantaneously fall by basis points  the cpr assumptions on mortgage loans and securities were and on december  and december   respectively 
on both december  and december   the rates paid on non maturity deposits savings  money management and now accounts were assumed not to change under either interest rate environment 
estimated increase decrease in annual net interest income increase estimated changes in annual net interest income decrease in market december  december  interest rates in basis points rate shock change change change change dollars in thousands comparing the changes in net interest income on december  and december   the estimated change in net interest income improved by  from a loss of million to a loss of million if interest rates were to instantaneously fall by basis points 
correspondingly  if interest rates were to instantaneously rise by basis points  the estimated change in net interest income improved by  from a loss of  to  this represents an improving but modest change in the basic interest rate risk profile of the company
