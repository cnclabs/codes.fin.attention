liquidity and capital resources the company s need for capital is primarily to maintain or increase the surplus of its insurance subsidiaries and to support the company as an insurance holding company  including the maintenance of its status as a public company

the debentures pay interest quarterly at and are due between september and may during the year ended december  the company paid million in interest on these debentures to american progressive  which was eliminated in consolidation 
management believes that the current cash position  the availability of the revolving loan facility  the expected cash flows of the non insurance companies  the surplus note interest payments from american exchange and the availability of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries can support the obligations of universal american noted above for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance as to the expected future cash flows or to the availability of dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
insurance subsidiaries american progressive  american pioneer  american exchange  constitution life  marquette  peninsular life  penncorp life of canada  pennsylvania life and union bankers collectively  the insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting 
each of the insurance subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus exceeds its respective minimum requirement 
however  substantially more than such minimum amounts are needed to meet statutory and administrative requirements of adequate capital and surplus to support the current level of the insurance subsidiaries operations 
at december  the statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserves  of the us insurance subsidiaries totaled million 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic imposes regulatory risk based capital rbc requirements on life insurance enterprises and at december  all of the insurance subsidiaries maintained ratios of total adjusted capital to rbc in excess of the authorized control level 
penncorp life of canada and pennsylvania life s canadian branch report to canadian regulatory authorities based upon canadian statutory accounting principles that vary in some respects from us statutory accounting principles 
canadian net assets based upon canadian statutory accounting principles were million as of december  penncorp life of canada maintained a minimum continuing capital and surplus requirement ratio mccsr in excess of the minimum requirement and pennsylvania life s canadian branch maintained a test of adequacy of assets in canada and margin ratio taam in excess of the minimum requirement at december  cash generated by the insurance subsidiaries will be made available to universal american  the ultimate parent  principally through periodic payments of principal and interest on surplus debentures 
currently  the surplus notes between universal american and american exchange total million  which calls for interest at the libor rate plus basis points 
the company anticipates that the surplus note will be primarily serviced by dividends from pennsylvania life  a wholly owned subsidiary of american exchange  and by tax sharing payments among the insurance companies which are wholly owned by american exchange filing a consolidated federal income tax return 
during the year end december   pennsylvania life and union bankers paid dividends amounting to million and million  respectively 
in addition  the insurance companies included in the tax allocation agreement with american exchange  paid million of taxes to american exchange 
during the year ended december   american exchange paid million in interest to universal american 
no principal payments were made during dividend payments by insurance companies are limited by  or subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of each insurance company s state of domicile 
such dividend requirements and approval processes vary significantly from state to state 
the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid to american exchange from pennsylvania life without the prior approval of the pennsylvania department of insurance is restricted to the greater of of the pennsylvania life s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding december or the net gain from operations during the preceding year  but such dividends can be paid only out of unassigned surplus 
thus  future earnings of the company would be available for dividends without prior approval  subject to the restrictions noted above

liquidity for the life insurance subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
these sources of liquidity for the insurance subsidiaries significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident health policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of the company s in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  the company imposes penalties for early surrenders 
at december  the company held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of its in force life insurance and annuities by million 
the insurance companies  in management s view  have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if the company were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
the company manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
the company seeks to invest in assets that have duration and interest rate characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
the net yields on the company s cash and invested assets increased slightly from in to in a significant portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by management based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity and equity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of million 
the fair values of these holdings totaled more than million 
investments the company s investment policy is to balance the portfolio duration to achieve investment returns consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity adequate to meet payment of policy benefits and claims
