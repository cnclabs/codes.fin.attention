operating income other income  net earnings before income taxes minority interest net income change in accounting principle in consideration of guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force in issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  we have retroactively changed our classification of freight charges billed to customers and related freight expenses from operating expenses to net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
these changes increased net sales by million  million  and million in  and  respectively  increased cost of goods sold by million  million  and million in  and  respectively  and decreased marketing  selling  general  and administrative expenses by million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
this accounting change had no impact on reported net income for any of the periods presented 
revenues net sales in fiscal year increased by to  million from  million in fiscal year  which had increased  from  million in fiscal year the increases from to included sales attributable to and acquisitions see acquisitions below 
in addition  sales of new products and increased efforts by apc s sales force have contributed to increased sales volumes  net sales attributable to new products totaled approximately   and  of  and  respectively 
sales for products in the small systems segment addressing networking applications and desktop pcs were negatively impacted by industry softness in the it markets  weakening global economies  and maturing markets 
the large systems segment experienced healthy growth driven by the build out of data centers and share gains in the phase ups market as well as the acquisition of dc power and precision cooling products for data centers and communications equipment 
the company experienced strong demand for its products across all solution applications in foreign sales to unaffiliated customers  primarily in europe  the far east  canada  and south america  in fiscal year were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million or of net sales in fiscal year compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year gross margins for fiscal year were of sales  approximately basis points lower than in fiscal year the gross margin erosion was associated with product mix shifts to lower margin products  the effect of pro active consumer product price cuts in  and manufacturing inefficiencies from continued global capacity expansion 
our product mix during reflected volumes shifting to the high end enterprise business  which has a lower gross margin structure than our traditional core business 
cost of goods sold was million or of net sales in fiscal year compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year gross margins for fiscal year were of sales  approximately basis points higher than in fiscal year the improvement was driven primarily by manufacturing cost reductions  particularly material cost reductions  the ongoing transition of production from the us and ireland to the philippines  improved capacity utilization associated with the closure of our manufacturing facility in fort meyers  florida  and volume related margin improvements in silcon and symmetra products 
total inventory reserves at december  were million compared to million at december  apc s reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure  reduced by an amount reasonably forecasted to be sold  and adjusting its interim reserve provisioning to cover the net loss exposure 
segment results refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for important information regarding the company s reportable segments net sales for products in the small systems segment  which primarily address local and wide are networking applications as well as desktop pcs  increased and over the prior years in and  respectively 
the rate of growth from through was negatively impacted by industry softness in the it markets  weakening global economies  and maturing markets 
profits for this segment have remained relatively stable as a percentage of net sales in spite of declining sales growth and pro active price reductions during  principally due to transitioning the manufacture of certain products to lower cost facilities 
net sales for products in the large systems segment  which primarily provides large power and availability solutions for data centers  facilities  and communications equipment  increased and over the prior years in and  respectively 
the large systems segment experienced healthy growth driven by the build out of data centers and share gains in the phase ups market with our silcon products as well as the acquisition of dc power and precision cooling products for data centers and communications equipment 
profits for this segment have declined due to cost inefficiencies resulting from continued global capacity expansion  as well as the continued investment in product and business development initiatives for this business segment 
operating expenses marketing  selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in and million or of net sales in the increase in total spending in was due primarily to continued investments in building a global relational sales organization 
the increase in was due primarily to costs associated with increased advertising and promotional costs  as well as costs associated with increased staffing and operating expenses of our marketing  selling  and administrative functions 
during the third and second quarters of  we agreed to license worldwide patent rights relating to uninterruptible power supply technology for lump sum cash payments of million and million  respectively  as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these license fees were paid from operating cash during the third and second quarters of apc evaluated the portion of the license fees that represented payment for prior use of the subject technology and the portion that represented payment for future use 
considering each of our markets and the historical and projected revenue realized in markets utilizing the licensed technology  we estimated the present value of royalty payments  basing this calculation on an appropriate royalty rate and the technology s contribution to the overall value of affected products 
separate present values were calculated for both historic and projected product sales  the historic values were expensed and the projected values were capitalized 
accordingly  write offs of the fully paid up portions of the patent licenses were recognized in our statements of income for the third and second quarters of as special charges to pre tax earnings of million and million  respectively  including direct expenses of million and million  respectively 
the remaining balances of million and million have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet as long term assets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over three years and nine years  respectively  the estimated remaining economic lives of the patent licenses 
the allowance for bad debts was of gross accounts receivable at december  compared to at december  we continue to experience strong collection performance 
accounts receivable balances outstanding over days represented of total receivables at december  compared to at december  the increase reflects a growing portion of our business originating in areas where longer payment terms are customary  including a growing contribution from international markets as well as large system enterprise sales primarily associated with silcon products 
write offs of uncollectable accounts represent less than of net sales 
a majority of international customer balances are covered by receivables insurance 
r d expenditures were million or of net sales in  million or of net sales in  and million or of net sales in the increased r d spending primarily reflects increased numbers of software and hardware engineers and costs associated with new product development and engineering support 
the slight decrease as a percentage of sales from to was attributable to certain fixed r d expenses spread over a higher revenue base 
in addition  during we recorded non recurring charges of million for acquired in process r d in connection with its acquisition of silcon see acquisitions below 
other income  net and income taxes other income is comprised principally of interest income  which increased substantially from to due to higher average cash balances available for investment during and excluding non tax deductible charges of million for acquired in process r d see acquisition section below  our effective income tax rates were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to is due to the tax savings from an increasing portion of taxable earnings being generated from apc s operations in jurisdictions currently having a lower income tax rate than the present us statutory income tax rate 
effects of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on apc s operations 
liquidity and financial resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  apc has been able to increase its working capital position as the result of continued strong operating results and despite internally financing the capital investment required to expand its operations and fund the licensing of technology discussed below 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments position decreased to million at december  from million at december   due primarily to outlays from operating cash in related to acquisitions see acquisitions section below and the licensing of worldwide patent rights relating to uninterruptible power supply technology see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
worldwide inventories were million at december   up from million at december   due primarily to increases in on hand raw materials  to support current and anticipated demand growth for enterprise products  and lower than expected demand in the fourth quarter of  combined with million in inventory attributable to acquisitions during see acquisitions section below 
inventory levels as a percentage of quarterly sales were in the fourth quarter of  up from in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of at december   we had million available for future borrowings under an unsecured line of credit agreement at a floating interest rate equal to the bank s cost of funds rate plus 
and an additional million and million under unsecured line of credit agreements with a second and third bank  respectively  at similar interest rates 
no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december  apc had no significant financial commitments  other than those required in the normal course of business  at december  during and  our capital expenditures  net of capital grants  amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of manufacturing and office equipment  buildings and improvements  and purchased software applications 
the nature and level of capital spending was made to improve manufacturing capabilities  principally in the us and the far east  to upgrade and expand our it infrastructure  and to support the increased marketing  selling  and administrative efforts necessitated by our growth 
substantially all of apc s net capital expenditures were financed from available operating cash 
we had no material capital commitments at december  apc has agreements with the industrial development authority of ireland  otherwise knows as the ida 
under these agreements  we receive grant monies for costs incurred for machinery  equipment  and building improvements for our galway and castlebar facilities 
these grants are equal to and  respectively  of such costs up to a maximum of million for galway and million for castlebar 
such grant monies are subject to apc meeting certain employment goals and maintaining operations in ireland until termination of the respective agreements 
under separate agreements with the ida  we receive direct reimbursement of training costs at our galway and castlebar facilities for up to  and  respectively  per new employee hired 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current internal cash flows together with available cash  available credit facilities or  if needed  the proceeds from the sale of additional equity  will be sufficient to support anticipated capital spending and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future

realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are measured based upon the effect of changes in exchange rates on the actual or expected amount of functional currency cash flows 
transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations in  and at december   apc s unhedged foreign currency accounts receivable  by currency  were as follows in thousands foreign currency us dollars european euros   british pounds   japanese yen   german marks   swiss francs   french francs   apc also had non trade receivables denominated in irish pounds of approximately us million  liabilities denominated in various european currencies of approximately us million  and liabilities denominated in japanese yen of approximately us million 
we continually review our foreign exchange exposure and consider various risk management techniques  including the netting of foreign currency receipts and disbursements  rate protection agreements with customers vendors and derivatives arrangements  including foreign exchange contracts 
we presently do not utilize rate protection agreements or derivative arrangements 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   as provided for in sfas no 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results this document contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this document 
our quarterly results are likely to be volatile 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the growth rates in the ups industry and related industries  including but not limited to the pc  server  networking  telecommunications and enterprise hardware industries  timing of orders from  and shipments to  customers  timing of new product introductions and the market acceptance of those products  increased competition  changes in manufacturing costs  changes in the mix of product sales  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand  component constraints and shortages  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivable  expansion of manufacturing capacity  factors associated with international operations  and changes in world economic conditions 
to remain competitive and expand our growth  we need to manage our growth expansion effectively 
we have experienced  and are currently experiencing  growth in our business which has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on our resources 
in order to support the growth of our business  we plan to continue expanding our level of global operations during if our management is unable to manage growth effectively  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we currently compete with several firms providing power protection and related products and services and expect competition to increase in the future  which could affect our revenue and profitability 
we believe that we are one of less than ten global companies providing a full range of ups products and services worldwide 
the ups  power protection and related industries  however  are highly competitive on both a worldwide basis and a regional geographic basis 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with several us and foreign firms  both on a worldwide basis and in various geographical regions  and within individual product and application niches 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and a number of companies that may enter our existing or future markets 
increased competition could adversely affect our revenue and profitability through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in our products include product performance and quality  marketing and access to distribution channels  customer services  and product design and price 
some of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we have 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors 
failure to alter our products to meet the demands of technological innovation could seriously harm our business 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products 
we may not be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products or in responding effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
the timely availability of new products and enhancements  and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success 
delays in such availability or a lack of market acceptance could have an adverse effect on our business 
defects in our products could seriously harm our business 
our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers 
these defects could result in loss or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  or financial condition 
loss of any of our key personnel could seriously harm our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of key management  sales  marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel  many of whom we would have difficulty replacing 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  and management  sales  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
because we depend on foreign operations and revenues  we are exposed to currency fluctuations  import barriers and other risks related to conducting foreign operations 
we manufacture and market our products worldwide through several foreign subsidiaries  distributors  and resellers 
our worldwide operations are subject to the risks normally associated with foreign operations including  but not limited to the disruption of markets  changes in export or import laws  restrictions on currency exchanges  potentially negative tax consequences  longer payment terms  political instability  and the modification or introduction or government policies with potentially adverse effects 
international sales  which are both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the united states  accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenue 
we invoice our customers in various currencies 
to date  we do not use any rate protection agreements or derivative agreements to hedge any foreign exchange exposure 
accordingly  we may be exposed to exchange losses based upon currency exchange rate fluctuations  which losses could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
a significant portion of products in our small systems and large systems reportable operating segments are manufactured in foreign locations 
the small systems have particular exposure to the philippines  a country which has experienced political and financial instability 
disruption of manufacturing efforts in these international facilities could negatively impact our ability to fulfill customer orders and potentially result in the loss of business 
because our business relies upon a variety of computer systems to operate effectively  the failure or disruption of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
apc is a highly automated company whose efficient and effective operation relies on a variety of information systems  including e mail  enterprise resource planning  electronic data interchange  customer resource management and e commerce systems 
disruption in the operation of these systems  or difficulties in maintaining or upgrading these systems  could have an adverse effect on our business 
in january  we upgraded our enterprise resource planning system 
difficulties that we have encountered  or may encounter  in connection with our implementation and use of this upgraded enterprise resource planning system could adversely affect our order management and fulfillment  financial reporting and supply chain management processes  and any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on sole source suppliers may result in product delays or price increases 
we currently obtain some components of our products from single sources 
in the future  our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
we generally purchase these single or limited source components using purchase orders and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with the suppliers 
in addition  the availability of many of these components is dependent in part on our ability to provide the suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements 
however  our operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components 
we have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and others could infringe on or misappropriate our propriety rights and information 
our success will depend  to a large extent  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets  patents  and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights 
although we own certain patents  and we have applied  and in the future we may apply  for patents  our intellectual property protection may not be sufficient to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors which independently develop functionally equivalent technology 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
we attempt to ensure that our products and processes do not infringe upon third party patents and other proprietary rights  but third parties may allege such infringement in the future 
if third parties allege or determine infringement  we may not prevail in such a challenge 
furthermore  if infringement is determined  we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to identify and successfully integrate acquisitions  our ability to expand and our financial results could suffer 
we have limited experience in integrating acquired companies or technologies into our operations 
we may from time to time pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets  products or technologies 
we may not be able to integrate successfully products  technologies  distribution channels  key personnel and businesses of acquired companies into our business or product offerings 
in addition  the integration of acquired companies may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
further  these acquired companies  assets  products or technologies may not contribute significantly to our sales or earnings  and the sales and earnings from acquired businesses may be adversely affected by the integration process or other factors 
if we are not successful in the integration of such acquired businesses  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisition transactions in the future 
our stock price could be volatile  which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products developed by us or our competitors  and challenges associated with integration of businesses and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our tax rate depends on earnings derived from certain foreign manufacturing operations 
our tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that we derive from our ireland and philippines manufacturing operations and our ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
if the earnings of these operations as a percentage of our total earnings were to decline significantly from anticipated levels  or should our ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  our effective tax rate would exceed the currently estimated rate for in addition  should our intercompany transfer pricing with respect to our ireland or philippines manufacturing operations require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  our overall effective tax rate could increase 
we have been and may become involved in litigation  which could materially harm our business 
we have been and may in the future become  involved in litigation involving our business  products or operations 
the litigation process is uncertain and includes the risk of an unexpected  unfavorable result 
we may be materially adversely impacted by any such litigation
