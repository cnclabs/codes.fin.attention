microfridge sales revenue has increased primarily due to success in the hotel  motel and academic markets 
the laundry sales increase is the result of increased penetration of certain markets and price increases 
other revenue  which consists primarily of laundry and microfridge rental revenue  has decreased  or  from the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to the company s decision to continue to withdraw from the less profitable microfridge academic and direct rental programs as it attempts to convert these programs to sales and long term leases

impairment of goodwill 
the company acquired copico  inc in april for approximately  in cash and  shares of mac gray common stock  in addition to the assumption of certain liabilities 
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting the purchase price was assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with any excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill and intangibles 
the goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with the transaction were approximately  since the acquisition of copico  inc  the reprographics division had not met expectations with respect to its profitability and produced operating losses 
the most significant reason for the poor performance of the division was the impact of technological advances which have affected the entire reprographics industry 
specifically  the introduction of the internet in college and public libraries  and access to free laser printers led to fewer vended copies being made than in prior years 
in april  the company began to take corrective action to address certain operational difficulties the division was encountering and to evaluate the entire impact the availability of the internet in college and public libraries was having on the division 
the company replaced the senior management of this division and addressed other organizational and operational inefficiencies which had been negatively impacting the performance of this division 
the company continued to monitor the performance of the division for the remainder of  and due to the lack of satisfactory improvement and the continued insurgence of the internet into its customer base  the company performed a full scale reevaluation of the division and its long term prospects in the fourth quarter of the result of this evaluation was the confirmation of longer term expectations of lower operating results 
accordingly  management recognized a non cash impairment charge of  or 
per share  in the fourth quarter of this charge was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from year ended december  this increase is primarily related to a full year of the outstanding borrowings related to the significant acquisition activity during  capital expenditures associated with internal growth  acquisition of capital stock and higher interest rates associated with the company s outstanding loan balances 
provision for income tax 
the effective tax rate increased from to from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the provision for income tax is higher than the company statutory tax rate due to goodwill recorded in as a result of certain of the company s acquisitions 
the increase in the effective tax rate results from the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets which are permanently non deductible items 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include a tax benefit of due to the release of a valuation allowance on certain tax assets available for use by intirion 
seasonality the company experiences moderate seasonality as a result of its significant operations in the college and university market 
revenues derived from the college and university market represent approximately twenty five percent of the company s total revenue 
route and rental revenues are derived substantially during the school year that includes the first  second and fourth calendar quarters 
conversely  the company increases its operating expenditures during the third calendar quarter  when colleges and universities are not in session  as a result of mac gray s increased product installation activities 
product sales  principally microfridge  to this market are also high during the third calendar quarter 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in thousands mac gray s primary source of cash since december  has been operating activities 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchase of new laundry machines  microfridge equipment  reprographics equipment and the reduction of bank debt 
the company anticipates that it will continue to use cash flow from its operating activities to finance working capital needs  including interest payments on any outstanding indebtedness  as well as capital expenditures 
to help mitigate the effect of possible higher interest rates in the future  on february   the company negotiated interest rate swaps  and fixed  of loan interest rate for years and  of loan interest rate for years 
cash flows provided by operations were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flow from operations consists primarily of route revenue  product sales  laundry equipment service revenue  and rental revenue  offset by commissions  route expenditures  cost of product sales  cost of rental revenue  general and administration expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
the increase from to is primarily attributable to an overall improvement in the company s financial performance  improved management of working capital  in particular  operating practices which led to inventory reductions of  since december   and an increase in depreciation and amortization which is a non cash expense 
cash used in investing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the total cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the lack of business acquisitions and lower capital expenditures in the year ended december  capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures was due to less equipment placed in service and the average cost of leases decreasing in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in and cash flows from financing activities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities for those periods consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank borrowings  and capital stock transactions 
the decrease in is principally a result of the lack of business acquisitions and capital stock transactions  and a decrease in capital spending 
as a result of these factors  the company was able to reduce its total bank and other debt by  for the year ended december  on june   the company refinanced its outstanding senior secured credit facility as referenced  the senior secured credit facility with new lenders 
this transaction retired the credit facility that had been in place since april  the senior secured credit facility provided for borrowings of up to  consisting of borrowings under a three year revolving line of credit of up to  and a five year  senior secured term loan facility 
through principal payments made quarterly since the inception of the senior secured credit facility  the  senior secured term loan facility has been reduced to  as of december   the unused balance of the senior secured credit facility was  the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as of december outstanding indebtedness under the senior secured credit facility bears interest  at the company s option  at a rate equal to the i prime rate plus  or ii libor plus for the year ended december  on february   these rates were reduced to i prime rate  or ii libor plus  as a result of improved financial performance by the company as defined in the senior secured credit facility 
further reductions in interest rates are possible if the company s financial performance continues to improve 
the average interest rate at december  was approximately 
the senior secured credit facility restricts payments of dividends and other distributions  restricts the company from making certain acquisitions and incurring indebtedness  and requires it to maintain certain financial ratios 
the senior secured credit facility is collateralized by a blanket lien on the assets of the company and each of its subsidiaries  as well as a pledge by the company of all of the capital stock of its subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit facility is subject to certain financial and operational covenants with which the company was in compliance at december  the most restrictive of these covenants is maintaining certain leverage ratios 
at december  outstanding letters of credit amounted to the unused balance under the senior secured credit facility was  at december the senior secured credit facility contains a commitment fee equal to one quarter of one percent per annum of the average daily unused portion of the credit facility 
inflation the company does not believe that its financial performance has been materially affected by inflation 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standard board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
fin clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
and among other issues clarifies the following the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal adoption of this sab had no impact on the company s results of operations 
in june and june  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  and financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities fas 
these statements amend the accounting and reporting standards for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas and fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe that the implementation of fas and fas in fiscal will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
under fas  the company s interest rate swap agreements are considered plain vanilla cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the fair value of the swap agreements will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
risk factors a purchase of mac gray common stock involves various risks 
investors should consider the following principal risk factors the company s cash flows may not be sufficient to finance the significant capital expenditures required to replace equipment and implement new technology 
the company must continue to make capital expenditures in order to replace existing equipment  which requires significant operating financing 
in addition  the company s plan to use smart card based technologies will also require significant capital expenditures 
while it is anticipated that existing capital resources  as well as cash from operations  will be adequate to finance anticipated capital expenditures  the company cannot assure the investor that the company s resources or cash flows will be sufficient 
to the extent that available resources are insufficient to fund capital requirements  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or curtail certain capital expenditures 
such financings may not be available or available only on less favorable terms and  in the case of equity financings  could result in dilution to our stockholders 
indebtedness may limit the company s use of cash flow and restrict its flexibility 
in the event the company is unable to decrease the outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility  the increased indebtedness could o require use if a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make payments on indebtedness  leaving less cash flow available for other purposes  o materially limit or impair the company s ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  general corporate or other purposes  and o reduce flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
the senior secured credit facility requires the company to comply with various financial and other operating covenants 
failure to comply with any of these covenants  which the lender does not waive  would permit the lender to accelerate the loan 
an acceleration of the loan could have a material adverse effect on business 
operations could be disrupted if the company were unable to renew its laundry leases 
the business is highly dependent upon the renewal of leases with property owners  colleges and universities and public housing authorities 
these leases have an average length of seven to ten years with approximately to renewable each year 
mac gray has traditionally relied upon exclusive  long term leases with its customers  as well as frequent customer interaction and a historical emphasis on customer service  to assure continuity of financial and operating results 
the company cannot assure investors that o it will be able to continue to secure long term exclusive leases with customers on favorable terms  o it will be able to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  or o it will not experience a loss of business if property owners or management companies choose to vacate properties as a result of economic downturns that impact occupancy levels 
failure by the company to continue to obtain long term exclusive leases with a substantial number of its customers  or to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  could have a material adverse effect on business 
competition on local and national levels may hinder the company s ability to expand 
the card and coin operated laundry services industry is highly competitive  both locally and nationally 
on the local level  private businesses tend to have long standing relationships with property owners and managers in their specific geographic market 
on the national level  there are two competitors  which have significantly larger installed machine bases than mac gray 
these larger companies tend to have significant operational and managerial resources to devote to expansion and to capture additional market share 
these competitive forces may increase purchase prices for future acquisitions to levels that make the acquisitions less attractive or uneconomical 
accordingly  the company cannot assure that it we will be able to compete effectively in any specific geographic location in the business of supplying laundry equipment services to property owners and managers or in the acquisition of other businesses 
the company s ability to make acquisitions depends upon its ability to access capital on acceptable terms 
partial success of the company s growth strategy is dependent upon its ability to identify  finance and consummate acquisitions on acceptable financial terms 
the access to capital is subject to the following risks o use of common stock as acquisition consideration may result in dilution to stockholders  o if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient valuation or if potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept shares of the company s common stock  then the company will be required to use more cash resources or other consideration to make acquisitions  o if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash for acquisitions from existing operations  its ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected unless it is able to obtain additional capital through external financings or to borrow sufficient amounts  and o funding the acquisition program through debt financing will result in additional leverage 
growth strategy may not be successful if the company is unable to acquire and integrate new businesses 
the company s growth strategy depends  in part  on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate and operate additional businesses 
while the company generally believes that the management team and business structure currently in place enables it to operate a significantly larger and more diverse operation  it may be exposed to the following risks in connection with finding  completing  and successfully integrating acquisitions o the inability to effectively and efficiently integrate the assets of the acquired business  o the inability to increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business  o the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of money and time integrating acquired businesses  particularly operations located in new regions and operations involving new lines of business  and o future acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting may result in the recording of goodwill and intangibles  the amortization of which may reduce our net income 
operations could be disrupted if the company is unable to continue its relationships with maytag and other suppliers 
currently the company purchases a majority of the equipment that it uses in the laundry route business from maytag corporation 
in addition  the company derives a significant amount of our non laundry route revenue  as well as competitive advantages  from its position as a distributor of maytag commercial laundry products 
although the agreements between the company and maytag corporation may be terminated by either party upon written notice  maytag corporation has never terminated any agreement with the company 
in addition  the company currently procures a substantial amount of the products used by the microfridge division from a limited number of suppliers 
if any of these suppliers terminated or demanded a substantial revision of the contracts or business relationships currently in place  there may be a delay in finding a replacement  and an inability to find terms as favorable as the current terms 
the microfridge products may be susceptible to product liability claims for which insurance may not be adequate 
through the microfridge division  the company markets and distributes microfridge  a combination microwave and refrigerator 
the sale and distribution of microfridge  as well as other products  entails a risk of product liability claims 
further  although microfridge is manufactured by third parties under contract with microfridge  microfridge may be subject to risks of product liability claims related to this manufacture 
potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage 
the company cannot assure investors that it will be able to renew our existing insurance at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that presently in effect  if at all 
in the event that the microfridge division is held liable for a claim against which it is not indemnified or for damages exceeding the limits of insurance coverage  the claim could have a material adverse effect on business 
reliance upon common law and contractual intellectual property rights may be insufficient to protect the company from adverse claims 
the company relies upon certain trademark  service mark  copyright  patent and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure and non solicitation agreements and other methods to protect proprietary rights 
periodically the company makes filings with the patent and trademark office to protect some of our proprietary rights  although the company has traditionally relied upon the protections afforded by contract rights and through common law ownership rights 
the company cannot assure investors that these contract rights and legal claims to ownership will adequately protect the operations from adverse claims 
in addition  any adverse claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly and could divert management s attention from the operation of the business 
certain stockholders  directors and executive officers could exercise control and prevent a sale or merger 
as of march   mac gray s directors  executive officers  and certain of its stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate nearly of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
this percentage ownership does not include options to purchase  shares of the common stock held by some of these persons  all of which are currently exercisable 
if these affiliates exercised any of their options  then the ownership of common stock would be further concentrated 
as a result of this concentration in ownership  these stockholders  if they were to act together  could have the ability  as a practical matter  to significantly influence the outcome of the election of directors and all other matters requiring approval by a majority of stockholders 
matters requiring stockholder approval include significant corporate transactions  such as mergers and sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the concentration of ownership in affiliates  together  in some cases  with specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  and applicable sections of the corporate law of delaware  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of mac gray 
a discussion of this anti takeover effect appears below 
provisions of the company s charter  bylaws  delaware law  and the shareholder rights agreement could have the effect of discouraging takeovers 
specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  sections of the corporate law of delaware and powers of the board of directors may discourage takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors  including takeovers which some stockholders may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could delay or prevent the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by stockholders  even if the particular removal or assumption of control would be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors also could discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if these events would be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of stockholders 
the anti takeover provisions and powers of the board of directors include  among other things o ability of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the voting rights  preferences and other terms of such preferred stock  o a classified board of directors serving staggered three year terms  o the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent  o the absence of cumulative voting for directors  o the removal of directors only for cause  o the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors to determine the size of the board of directors and  subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock  if issued  to fill vacancies thereon  o the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors  except as otherwise required by law  to call special meetings of stockholders  o advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors  o ownership restrictions  under the corporate law of delaware  with limited exceptions  upon acquirors including their affiliates and associates of or more of our common stock  and o the company s entry into a shareholder rights agreement providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of the common shares unless the rights are redeemed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates on its borrowings 
in the normal course of its business  the company manages its exposure to these risks as described below 
the company does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rates the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair market value of long term debt approximates the book value at december  december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total long term debt fixed rate  average interest rate variable rate       average interest rate in february  the company entered into two standard international swaps and derivatives isda interest rate swap agreements with its primary financial institution to manage the interest rate risk associated with its senior credit facility 
each agreement has a notional amount of  and maturity dates in february and the effect of the swap agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to a fixed rate of and versus the day libor rate for the three year and five year swaps  respectively 
in accordance with the swap agreements and on a quarterly basis  interest expense is calculated based on the floating day libor and the fixed rate 
if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the day libor  the financial institution pays the difference to the company  if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the fixed rate  the company pays the difference to the financial institution 
depending on fluctuations in the libor  the company s interest rate exposure and its related impact on interest expense and net cash flow may increase or decrease 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the swap agreement  however  nonperformance is not anticipated 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counterparty 
at december   the company estimates that it would have paid  to terminate these agreements
