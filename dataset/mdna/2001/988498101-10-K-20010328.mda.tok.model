item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction tricon global restaurants  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as tricon or the company is comprised of the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut and taco bell the concepts and is the world s largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units 
separately  each brand ranks in the top ten among qsr chains in us system sales and units 
our  international units make us the second largest qsr company outside the us tricon became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
throughout management s discussion and analysis md a  we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net gain  unusual items and our accounting and human resources policy changes in collectively  the accounting changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions 
we use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and as the base to forecast future performance 
ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the us and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in  our international business  tricon restaurants international tri or international accounted for of system sales  of total revenues and of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange gains and losses 
we anticipate that  despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations  we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages and the cautionary statements on pages all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as otherwise specifically identified 
factors affecting comparability of results to impact of ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process see note for a complete discussion of the impact of the ameriserve food distribution  inc ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process on the company 
kraft taco shell recall in the fourth quarter of  allegations were made by a public environmental advocacy group that testing of corn taco shells  sold by kraft foods  inc kraft in grocery stores under a license to use the taco bell brand name  had indicated the presence of genetically modified gm corn which had only been approved by the applicable us governmental agencies for animal consumption 
in light of the allegations  kraft recalled this product line 
we are not aware of any evidence that suggests that the gm corn at issue presents any significant health risk to humans 
nonetheless  consistent with our overall quality assurance procedures  we have taken significant actions to ensure that our restaurant supply chain is free of products containing the gm corn in question  and we will continue to take whatever actions are prudent or appropriate in this regard 
although we are unable to estimate the amount  we believe that our taco bell restaurants have experienced a negative impact on sales following the allegations and the kraft recall 
we do not currently believe this sales impact will be sustained over the long term 
franchisee financial condition like others in the qsr industry  from time to time  some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations 
at present  certain of our franchise operators  principally in the taco bell system  are facing varying degrees of financial problems  primarily as a result of declines in store sales in the taco bell system  which we believe have been exacerbated by the grocery product recalls of corn taco shells by kraft in the fourth quarter of depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation  and in the absence of an improvement in business trends  there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues  including a sale of some or all of the operator s restaurants to us or a third party  a restructuring of the operator s business and or finances  or  in the more unusual cases  bankruptcy of the operator 
it is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues 
taco bell has established a million loan program for those franchisees in need of short term assistance due to the recent sales declines in the taco bell system 
through february  this program has aided approximately franchisees covering approximately  taco bell restaurants 
additionally  taco bell is in various stages of discussions with a number of other taco bell franchisees and their lenders 
we believe that many of these franchisees will require various types of business and or financial restructuring 
based on currently available information  we believe that this group of franchisees represents approximately  taco bell restaurants 
in  we charged approximately million to ongoing operating profit for expenses related to the financial situation of certain taco bell franchisees 
these expenses  which relate primarily to allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables  were reported as general and administrative expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we assess our exposure from franchise related risks which include estimated uncollectibility of accounts receivable related to franchise and license fees  contingent lease liabilities  guarantees to support certain third party financial arrangements with franchisees and potential claims by franchisees 
the contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the contingent liabilities section of note although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time  we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure to the company as of december  it is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs which could be material to quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
based on the information currently available to us  we have budgeted for an estimate of expenses and capital expenditures that may be required to address this situation 
however  the taco bell franchise financial situation poses certain risks and uncertainties to us 
the more significant of these risks and uncertainties are described below 
significant adverse developments in this situation  or in any of these risks or uncertainties  could have a material adverse impact on our quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we intend to continue to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the number of franchise operators or restaurants experiencing financial difficulties will not change from our current estimates 
nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in resolving financial issues relating to any specific franchise operator 
additionally  there can be no assurance that resolution of these financial issues will not result in taco bell purchasing a significant number of restaurants from financially troubled taco bell franchise operators

store portfolio strategy beginning in  we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets 
this portfolio balancing activity has reduced  and will continue to reduce  our reported revenues and restaurant profits and has increased the importance of system sales as a key performance measure

the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the tax on our international operations  including the initial benefits of becoming eligible in to claim substantially all of our available foreign income tax credits for foreign taxes paid in against our us income tax liability 
this decrease was partially offset by adjustments relating to prior years 
in  the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the us federal statutory rate due to our ability to claim foreign taxes paid against our us income tax liability 
the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations in and was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate

the decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to a one time favorable international benefit in mexico

consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million primarily due to unusual charges associated with the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 
changes in operating working capital reflected a net use of cash of million 
the primary drivers of the net use were receivables from the ameriserve bankruptcy estate and franchisee receivables arising from the company s program to temporarily purchase food and supply inventories directly from third party suppliers for the tricon system and sell a portion of these supplies to franchisees and licensees the temporary direct purchase program related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 
these items resulted in a net cash usage of approximately million of working capital 
see note for a discussion of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 
excluding the ameriserve related items noted above  our operating working capital deficit reflects a decrease of million versus a decrease of million in the prior year 
our operating working capital deficit  which excludes cash  short term investments and short term borrowings  is typical of restaurant operations where the majority of sales are for cash while payment to suppliers carry longer payment terms  generally from days 
the lower working capital deficit reduction in is the result of refranchising significantly fewer restaurants in versus  as well as a change in payment terms in our distribution agreement from to days 
in  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million 
the decline was primarily due to a million decrease in our working capital deficit 
this decrease was driven by our portfolio activities which resulted in a significant reduction in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the decline in cash flow from investing activities was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants to franchisees in versus  increased capital spending related to development and funding of ameriserve during its bankruptcy reorganization process 
in  net cash provided by investing activities increased million to million 
the majority of the increase is due to higher gross refranchising proceeds and proceeds from the sale of international short term investments in connection with a planned tax efficient repatriation to the us although we report gross proceeds in our consolidated statements of cash flows  we also consider refranchising proceeds on an after tax basis 
we define after tax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities primarily accounts payable and property taxes related to the units refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains 
the after tax proceeds can be used to pay down debt or repurchase shares 
after tax proceeds were approximately million in which reflects a decrease from this decrease was due to the refranchising of significantly fewer restaurants in after tax proceeds were approximately million in  a increase versus the increase was principally due to a greater number of units refranchised as well as the mix of restaurants sold and the level of taxable gains from each refranchising 
net cash used in financing activities was million compared to billion last year 
less cash was available for financing activities in due to a net cash use from investing activities as described above  and a use of cash to fund increased share repurchases as more fully discussed in note accordingly  we repaid less debt in than in  net cash used in financing activities was essentially unchanged versus at billion 
payments on our unsecured term loan facility and our unsecured revolving credit facility totaled billion 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock  excluding applicable transaction fees 
this share repurchase program was completed in during  we repurchased over million shares for approximately million 
during  we repurchased over million shares for approximately million 
see note on february   our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program  as more fully described in note the new share repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase  over the next two years  up to million of our outstanding common stock  excluding applicable transaction fees 
we have not repurchased any shares under this program as of march  financing activities our primary bank credit agreement  as amended in and  is comprised of a senior  unsecured term loan facility and a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility collectively referred to as the credit facilities  both of which mature on october  amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility are expected to fluctuate  but term loan facility reductions may not be reborrowed 
at december   we had unused revolving credit facility borrowings available aggregating billion  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
we believe that we will be able to refinance a portion of our credit facilities with publicly issued bonds within the next twelve months 
as a result of this refinancing  we are likely to experience an increase in our interest rates  subject to rates available at the time of refinancing 
we also believe we will be able to replace or refinance the remaining credit facilities prior to maturity with new borrowings which will reflect the market conditions or terms available at that time 
the credit facilities subject us to significant interest expense and principal repayment obligations  which are limited in the near term  to prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on the credit facilities is based principally on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a variable margin factor as defined in the credit agreement 
therefore  our future borrowing costs may fluctuate depending upon the volatility in libor 
we currently mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
see notes and and our market risk discussion for further discussions of our interest rate risk 
consolidated financial condition assets increased million or to billion 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in receivables arising from the impact of the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process as more fully discussed in note liabilities decreased million or to billion 
excluding the impact of the aforementioned increase in accounts receivable arising from the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process  our working capital deficit decreased to approximately million at december  from million at december  the decline was primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable related to fewer company restaurants as a result of our portfolio actions  a change in payment terms to our new primary us distributor of food and paper and a reduction in accrued compensation 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes 
we believe the company has adequate financial resources to meet its requirements in and beyond 
other significant known events  trends or uncertainties expected to impact ongoing operating profit comparisons with impact of new unconsolidated affiliates consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets  we entered into an agreement in to form a new venture during in canada with our largest franchisee in that market 
during the third quarter of  we contributed restaurants in exchange for a equity interest in the venture 
these stores represented approximately of the total international company restaurants at the time of the formation of the new venture 
including the stores contributed by our partner  the new venture had approximately restaurants at the time of formation 
we did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to this new venture 
previously  the results from the restaurants we contributed to the canadian venture were consolidated 
the impact of this transaction on operating results is similar to the portfolio effect of our refranchising activities 
consequently  this transaction will result in a decline in our company sales  restaurant margin dollars and g a expenses as well as higher franchise fees and equity income 
in addition to the portfolio effect  franchise fees will be higher since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to this venture 
the overall impact from the formation of this venture on ongoing operating profit was slightly favorable 
had this venture been formed at the beginning of  our international company sales would have declined approximately compared to the reported decline of for the year ended december  in addition  we anticipate contributing about restaurants to a new venture in poland to be formed in we believe the impact on ongoing operating profit from the formation of the venture will not be significant 
impact of the consolidation of an unconsolidated affiliate beginning in fiscal  we will consolidate a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our consolidated financial statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate 
while we believe that the overall impact on our ongoing operating profit will not be significant  this change is expected to result in higher company sales  restaurant margin dollars and g a as well as decreased franchise fees and equity income 
had this change occurred at the beginning of  our international company sales would have increased approximately compared to the reported decline of for the year ended december  change in casualty loss estimates due to the inherent volatility of our actuarially determined casualty loss estimates  it is reasonably possible that we will experience changes in estimated losses which could be material to our growth in ongoing operating profit in see note for a discussion of our casualty loss programs and estimates 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic and monetary union emu adopted the euro as a common legal currency and fixed conversion rates were established 
greece has since adopted the single currency on january   taking the total adopting countries to twelve 
from january  through no later than february   all adopting countries will maintain a period of dual currency  where both legacy currencies and the euro can be used in day to day credit transactions 
beginning january   new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and a transition period of up to two months will begin during which local currencies will be removed from circulation 
we have company and franchised businesses in the adopting member countries  which are preparing for the conversion 
to date  expenditures associated with our conversion efforts have been relatively insignificant  totaling under million 
these expenditures have been concentrated mainly on consulting expenses for initial impact studies and head office accounting systems 
we currently estimate that the total spending over the transition period will be approximately million related to the conversion in the emu member countries in which we operate stores 
this is a reduction from our previous estimate of million  primarily due to the refranchising of company stores in certain emu countries 
approximately of these expenditures relate to capital expenditures for new point of sale and back of restaurant hardware and software to accommodate euro denominated transactions 
we believe that adoption of the euro by the united kingdom would significantly increase this estimate due to the size of our businesses there relative to our aggregate businesses in the adopting member countries in which we operate 
the pace of ultimate consumer acceptance of and our competitors responses to the euro are currently unknown and may impact our existing plans 
however  we know that  from a competitive perspective  we will be required to assess the impacts of product price transparency  potentially revise product bundling strategies and create euro friendly price points prior to we do not believe that these activities will have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses 
although the euro does offer certain benefits to our treasury and procurement activities  these are not currently anticipated to be significant 
we currently anticipate that our suppliers and distributors will continue to invoice us in local currencies until late we expect to begin dual pricing in our restaurants in late we expect to compensate employees in euros beginning in we believe that the most critical activity regarding the conversion for our businesses is the completion of the rollout of euro ready point of sale equipment and software by the end of our current plans should enable us to be euro compliant prior to the requirements for these changes 
any delays in our ability to complete our plans  or in the ability of our key suppliers to be euro compliant  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of financial instruments market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through utilization of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps  collars and forward rate agreements 
we are also exposed to the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize the risk exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations on our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
we also use forward contracts on a limited basis to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations on foreign currency denominated financial instruments and significant foreign currency denominated cash flows 
additionally  certain foreign currency denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to tax considerations and local regulatory restrictions which limit our ability to utilize these funds outside the country in which they are held 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of million in annual income before income taxes 
the estimated reduction is based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december  in addition  the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts would decrease approximately million in value to us  and the fair value of our senior unsecured notes would decrease approximately million 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows
