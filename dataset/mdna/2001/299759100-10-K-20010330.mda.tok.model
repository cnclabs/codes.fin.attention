in april  we received million from the sale of shares of our common stock at per share pursuant to a rights offering 
results shown before the period of the spin off reflect our activity as the battery business group of fuelcell 
to continue to meet our operating and capital requirements  we completed a private placement of our equity in december  raising million  net of expenses 
we also completed a public offering of our common stock in may the public offering raised net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share additionally  we completed another public offering in february this offering raised net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share

repayment of the bank loan was guaranteed by fuelcell 
in april  we received million of net proceeds from a rights offering  including funds received from the sale of unsubscribed shares pursuant to an agreement with standby underwriters 
we used a portion of these net proceeds to repay in full the bank loan and the line of credit from fuelcell  and those agreements were terminated 
to continue to meet our operating and capital requirements  we completed a private placement of our preferred equity in december  raising million  net of expenses 
we also completed a public offering of our common stock in may this public offering raised net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share

we believe the net proceeds from these sales will be sufficient to support our planned operations through in december  we borrowed approximately million from the virginia small business financing authority and  from the city of newport news  virginia  redevelopment and housing authority 
our cash requirements will vary depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the demand for our products  the efforts and success of our licensees and joint venture partners in developing and marketing products incorporating our battery technology  the development of battery markets  the level of competition that we face  our ability to develop  market and license new products and our ability to effectively manage operating expenses 
over time  we expect to continue to enter into license agreements and to participate in joint manufacturing ventures 
we have entered into a services agreement with fuelcell to provide us with certain management and administrative services and office  research and development and manufacturing support facilities and services 
the net fees which we paid to fuelcell pursuant to our services agreement were  for the year ended december    for the two months ended december  and  for the year ended october  these amounts exclude certain services billed on the basis of usage  such as purchasing  analytical lab  microscope analysis  machine shop and drafting 
these amounts reflect fuelcell s additional costs related to providing these services

recently issued accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and sfas it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement became effective for us on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
the adoption of sfas may cause increased volatility in the company s results of operations in the future if we change our policies or enter into new derivative instruments  which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we held no derivative instruments as of december  we are exposed to market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and repatriation  interest rates and commodity pricing 
the nature of each is as follows foreign currency exchange and repatriation we currently have international operations in the prc through our joint venture 
the currency of exchange is us dollars for all current international transactions  except for our joint venture in the prc 
although the prc controls the rate of exchange for the renminbi  a devaluation or free market valuation could impair our joint venture s ability to make payments for products sold or services rendered 
in the prc  we expect to continue to reinvest all monies earned as net income of the joint venture for the foreseeable future 
the prc may restrict the payments under our joint venture 
as a result  we might not be able to receive distributions from our joint venture in the future even if they are needed to meet obligations of our business or would be better employed in uses of our business outside of the prc 
interest rates we have invested and expect to invest excess funds in money market accounts in us financial institutions 
currently  our only indebtedness is million borrowed from the virginia small business financing authority at an interest rate of for years and  borrowed from the newport news redevelopment and housing authority at an interest rate of for years 
the loans are secured by substantially all of our assets 
based upon the level of cash and cash equivalents balance at december  an increase or decrease of interest rates of basis points would have an effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows of approximately  commodity pricing we do not hedge against price fluctuation in the commodities used in the manufacturing of our product 
we will reevaluate this policy as needed commensurate with the risk inherent in the business
