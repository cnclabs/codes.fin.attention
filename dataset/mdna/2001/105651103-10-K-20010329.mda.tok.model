in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions which could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
overview we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for consulting services  which are billed on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
invoices are typically issued bi weekly to monitor client satisfaction and manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized as the services are provided 
we recognize revenue on fixed price projects as services are performed over the life of the contract 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided for in full in the period when determined 
approximately of our consulting services revenues in were derived from fixed price contracts 
braun consulting s historical revenue growth is attributable to various factors  including an increase in the size and number of projects for existing and new clients  including international projects 
existing clients from the previous fiscal year generated approximately of our revenues in and approximately of our revenues in through the acquisitions of vertex partners and etci in  we acquired offices in boston  massachusetts  mount laurel  new jersey  and reston  virginia 
we manage our client development efforts through several strategic service groups  each having specific geographic responsibility and focus 
as of december   we had employees 
our most significant expense is project personnel and expenses  which consists primarily of project personnel salaries and benefits  and non reimbursed direct expenses incurred to complete projects 
we have sought to manage our costs by adding a variable portion of employee compensation payable upon the achievement of measurable performance goals 
braun consulting s project personnel and expenses as a percentage of revenues are also related to our consultant utilization 
we manage utilization by monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consultants assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project completions and scheduling delays may result in periods when consultants are not fully utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant project could also cause us to experience lower consultant utilization  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants 
in addition  we do not fully utilize our consulting personnel on billable projects during the initial months of their employment 
during that time they undergo training and become integrated into our operations 
to sustain our growth and profitability  we have made and continue to make substantial investments in infrastructure  including senior management and other experienced administrative personnel  experienced business development managers and an advanced management reporting system 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and travel costs of selling and marketing personnel and promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our executive management  finance and administrative groups including personnel devoted to recruiting  employee retention and training  occupancy costs including depreciation  amortization and office equipment leases  travel  and all other branch and corporate costs 
we continue to incur increased rent associated with our growth and the opening of new offices
