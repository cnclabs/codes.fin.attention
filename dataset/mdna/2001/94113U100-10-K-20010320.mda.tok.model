increased accounts receivable result from the increase in fourth quarter sales in the pool products and heating systems segment as compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in inventory resulted from lower than anticipated sales in the fourth quarter at both segments due to the difficult retail environment 
the increase in accrued income taxes is the result of the company operating as an independent public company for the entire year as compared with one month in the increase in accrued liabilities primarily relates to increased accrued rebates and warranty due to the growth in sales in the fourth quarter of as compared with the same period in in  cash generated from operations of  was used primarily to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of olympic of  to make  in capital expenditures and to advance  to ati

working capital increased to  at december  from  at december  the current ratio was unchanged at for both periods

olympic is located in montreal  quebec  and produces a full line of pool accessories ranging from cleaning and maintenance supplies to white goods  ladders  solar reels  floating lounges  and pool toys and games 
olympic distributes its products in canada  europe and the united states 
these pool accessories are being distributed in the us and europe under our water pik tm and jandy tm brand names 
total capital expenditures for and  excluding the purchases of olympic and allegheny technologies japan ltd  were  and  respectively 
at december   water pik technologies had capital expenditure commitments of  primarily for tooling and equipment for use in production 
we currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on water pik technologies common stock in order to conserve cash for use in our business  including possible future acquisitions 
in addition  the terms of our credit facilities prohibit us from paying dividends 
our board of directors will periodically re evaluate our dividend policy taking into account operating results  capital needs  the terms of our credit facilities and other factors 
prior to november  the company participated in the general liability  product liability  and workers compensation insurance programs sponsored by ati 
the company has since entered into general liability  product liability and workers compensation insurance programs of its own 
insurance coverage under these programs are subject to policy deductibles for which we are at risk for losses 
in connection with the spin off  we have agreed to indemnify ati for losses attributable to our operations prior to the spin off 
reserves have been established based upon existing and estimated claims and historical experience in settling such matters 
as a result of the spin off  ati transferred to the company reserves for estimated losses under these insurance programs totaling  and related deferred taxes of  during  a number of these cases were settled and at december   the company had reserves for estimated losses on claims existing at the time of the spin off and estimated claims subsequent to the spin off of  the actual settlements of claims under these insurance programs may differ from estimated reserves  but the possible range of loss in excess of those accrued is not reasonably estimable 
based upon currently available information  management does not believe that settlement of insurance claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operation or liquidity 
in connection with the spin off  ati received a tax ruling from the irs stating that the spin off would be tax free to ati and to ati s stockholders 
the continuing validity of the internal revenue service tax ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions  including the completion of a required public offering of the company s common stock within one year following the spin off and use of the anticipated gross proceeds of approximately  less associated costs for further development of high quality  lower cost manufacturing capabilities  for product line extensions  to expand channels of distribution  to develop a self sustaining product development process  and for acquisitions and or joint ventures 
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement that water pik technologies signed prior to the spin off  the company agreed with ati to undertake such a public offering 
on july   the irs issued a supplemental ruling to ati modifying certain requirements imposed under the prior tax ruling 
the supplemental ruling reduced the amount of equity capital required to be raised by the company from  to  provided an extension until april  for the completion of the offering and allowed the company to raise the required capital through a rights offering or private placement 
in january  the company issued  shares of common stock at per share in a private placement for gross proceeds of  to fulfill a material requirement of the ruling 
the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between ati and water pik technologies provides that we will indemnify ati and its agents and representatives for taxes imposed on  and other amounts paid by  them or ati s stockholders if the company takes actions or fails to take actions such as completing the equity offering that result in the spin off not qualifying as a tax free distribution 
if any of the taxes or other amounts were to become payable by the company  the payment could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow and the amount the company could be required to pay could exceed its net worth by a substantial amount

inflation inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates and has not had a material impact upon the company s results of operations for the periods discussed above 
impact of year the company spent approximately  during and in connection with updating and preparing its computer and information systems for the year date change 
the company did not experience business disruption or incur significant expenses in related to the date change 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risk associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 
the company has not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
these changes  if material  may cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
international operations constituted approximately percent of the company s consolidated sales 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations  primarily in canadian dollars and japanese yen  into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
the company does not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
the company does not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because it does not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
the change in currency exchange rates for the canadian dollar would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit 
the company estimates that a percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on reported operating profit 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to its domestic and canadian lines of credit 
the company s domestic line of credit bears interest at prime plus percent to percent  or at libor london interbank offered rate plus to basis points per annum 
the company s canadian line of credit bears interest at canadian or us prime rate plus percent 
the company estimates that a percent change in interest rates would not have a material impact on reported operating profit
