introduction the company derives its revenues  earnings and cash flows primarily from the sale of highly specialized oriented polypropylene films  referred to as opp films  used in consumer product labeling  flexible packaging and overwrap applications 
aet has a leading position in substantially all of the major high end opp films end use product categories in north america  and offers one of the most extensive product lines in the opp films industry  ranging from high margin  specialized label and high barrier films to basic heat sealable lower barrier films 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of aet sales represented by various income and expense items in their income statements years ended september sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating profit interest expense  net net loss fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal increased percent to  due to the realization of higher average selling prices  volume gains and continued improvement in sales mix 
sales outside the united states were and percent of sales for the fiscal year ended september  and  respectively  and generated operating profit of percent and percent of total operating profit in those same periods 
gross profit increased in fiscal to  or percent of sales  compared with  or percent of sales  in the same period of fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal is due to higher average selling prices and lower raw material costs  as well as continued improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
capacity utilization is expected to continue to tighten over the next several years due to the continued growth in demand for opp films and minimal anticipated capacity additions 
raw material costs declined throughout fiscal and are expected to increase only slightly in fiscal although impacted in the short term by the tragic events of september and the resulting economic weakness  long term margin expansion is expected to continue due to further improvement in sales mix  absorption of qpf sales and further tightening of industry capacity utilization 
total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  increased to  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  due primarily to  in costs incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of qpf  the non cash charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal related to the share incentive plan for non executive employees  and the  loss on sale of assets resulting from the sale of the specialty nets and nonwovens business 
research and development expense was  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal as the company continued to invest in new product development 
net interest expense in fiscal of  was  higher than interest expense in fiscal due primarily to a higher average outstanding debt balance in fiscal reflecting the  senior notes issued in june  offset in part by a lower interest rate on the senior notes and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
income tax expense benefit was  and for the fiscal years ended september  and september   respectively 
in fiscal  the company recorded a  valuation allowance for certain state and federal deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences for which the potential to realize the tax benefit given recent results is uncertain in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal of  were  or percent higher  than fiscal sales of  due to a percent increase in opp films sales volume combined with higher average selling prices 
fiscal represents the first year since where average selling prices increased  as the industry began passing on a portion of higher raw material costs and industry overcapacity continued to ease 
average annual opp films industry demand growth of approximately percent continued to absorb excess industry capacity 
sales outside the united states  primarily in canada  comprised percent of total fiscal sales compared to percent of total sales and operating profit for sales outside the united states was percent of total operating profit compared to percent in gross profit for of  includes  of temporary plant shutdown costs 
excluding these costs  gross profit for was  an increase of  or  percent  from the fiscal level of  while gross margin declined from percent of sales to percent of sales due to significantly higher raw material costs 
the cost of polypropylene resin  the company s primary raw material  rose unexpectedly as a result of the dramatic increase in the price of crude oil 
polypropylene resin prices increased over percent in the twelve months ended september  and percent in the eighteen months ended september   and only a small portion of these resin cost increases were successfully passed on to customers in the form of price increases  due to the excess capacity that still existed in the opp films industry 
in addition  the company held firm on a price increase in fiscal  losing some sales volume 
therefore  all opp films operations were shut down for one week in september  resulting in  of unabsorbed fixed costs incurred in the quarter 
research and development expense decreased by to  or percent of sales in fiscal  due primarily to differences in timing of research and development spending between fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal represented percent of sales compared with  or percent of sales in fiscal  as operating expenses were held to relatively constant levels despite significant increases in volume manufactured and sold during the year 
this resulted in a percent increase in operating profit from fiscal to fiscal net interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates on the bank credit facility in fiscal income tax as a percentage of before tax income was percent for and percent for fiscal the lower percentage reflected the benefit of tax planning

aet also has  of revenue bonds outstanding which are due november  and which are partially secured by a letter of credit issued under the bank credit facility 
on june   the company issued  of percent senior notes due the senior notes 
the senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of aet 
the net proceeds  after deducting fees and expenses  from the sale of the senior notes  were approximately million 
of those proceeds  million was used to fund the redemption of and interest on the percent senior notes due  million was used to fund the portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of the assets of qpf  million was used to repay existing indebtedness and interest due under the revolving credit facility  and the remainder is being held for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth opportunities 
in conjunction with the redemption of the percent senior notes due  the company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of  or

the purchase price for the qpf assets was  in conjunction with the qpf acquisition  the company incurred certain one time costs directly related to the acquisition and transition of the qpf business such as legal  incentive compensation and accounting costs that were recorded as an operating expense during the third quarter 
effective september   the company sold its specialty nets and nonwovens business to delstar technologies  inc the business  located in middletown  delaware  generated annual sales in fiscal of approximately  through the manufacture and sale of nets and nonwoven media 
this business was non core to the company 
the gross proceeds of the transaction were approximately  the company recorded a loss in the fourth fiscal quarter of of  on the sale of this business  reflecting the difference between the selling price and the net book value of the specialty nets and nonwovens assets  as well as transactions costs such as legal  banking  incentive compensation and accounting costs incurred in connection with the sale of the business 
operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  generated  of cash  which was the result of earnings before depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenditures of  and a decrease in working capital of  the net working capital increase was primarily the result of decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  a decrease in inventory of  and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  and accounts receivable of  decreases in accounts payable and inventory primarily reflect the lower cost of polypropylene resin 
during the year  payments against restructuring reserves  representing payments on an operating lease  reduced such accounts by to a balance of  at september  inflation management regularly reviews the prices charged for its products 
when market conditions allow  price adjustments are made to reflect changes in demand or product costs due to fluctuations in the cost of materials  labor and inflation 
the costs of raw materials make up a significant portion of costs and have historically fluctuated 
it cannot be assumed  however  that future market conditions will support any correlation between raw material cost fluctuations and finished product films pricing  as evidenced by the market dynamics in the second half of fiscal year when the price of polypropylene resin significantly increased due to the rising price of crude oil 
during that period  the company was only able to pass on a portion of the cost increase to customers due to overcapacity in the opp films market 
seasonal nature of some opp films markets some of the end use markets for opp films are seasonal 
for example  demand in the snack food  soft drink and candy markets is generally higher in the spring and summer 
as a result  sales and net income are generally higher in those periods  although actual results can be influenced by numerous factors  such as raw material costs  competitive prices and other factors mentioned in this prospectus
