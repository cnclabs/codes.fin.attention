market risk the company is exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of derivative contracts 
as clearly stated in the company s policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculating or for trading 
transactions are entered into only with banking institutions with strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these contracts is considered immaterial 
hedging program results and status are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
the following section describes the company s risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december  the sensitivity tests assumed instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rate yield curves 
a 
foreign exchange rates due to its international business presence  the company transacts extensively in foreign currencies 
as a result  corporate earnings experience some volatility related to movements in exchange rates 
in order to exploit the benefits of global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions  foreign exchange balance sheet exposures are aggregated and hedged at the corporate level through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the objective of the foreign exchange hedging program is to reduce earnings volatility resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet positions 
a hypothetical  instantaneous  percent adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates would decrease earnings by approximately million in the current reporting period 
the sensitivity analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on cummins competitive position as well as the remoteness of the likelihood that all foreign currencies will move in tandem against the us dollar 
the analysis also ignores the offsetting impact on income of the revaluation of the underlying balance sheet exposures 
b 
interest rates the company currently has in place three interest rate swaps that effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt 
the objective of the swaps is to more efficiently balance borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis assumed a hypothetical  instantaneous  basis point parallel increase in the floating interest rate yield curve  after which rates remained fixed at the new  higher level for a one year period 
this change in yield curve would correspond to a million increase in interest expense for the one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to changes in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
given the historically volatile nature of commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
the company uses commodity swap agreements to partially hedge exposures to changes in copper and aluminum prices 
given a hypothetical  instantaneous  percent depreciation of the underlying commodity price  with prices then remaining fixed for a month period  the company would experience a loss of approximately million for the annual reporting period 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of decreases in commodity costs
