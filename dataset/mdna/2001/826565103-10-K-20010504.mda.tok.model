the following discussion includes forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  about the markets in which we operate and our business and prospects  including statements about the sufficiency of our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents  our short term investments and our bank lines of credit to meet our working capital requirements  and the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our short term investments  our bank lines of credit and our foreign currency cash balances 
these statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties which may result in different or disappointing future business and financial results 
many of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in this report  including under factors affecting future operating results 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   our net revenues decreased to million from million reported for fiscal this decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the overall decline in the markets for our products due to the general economic slowdown during that period  the decline in demand for chipsets and boards in pc dvd applications due to the prevalence of dvd enabling software provided as original equipment in many pcs  delays in the deployment of video networking applications for the corporate market  and delays in deployment of set top boxes for the consumer internet information appliance market 
our revenues from sales of chipsets and boards in pc dvd applications  and sales from video networking products for the corporate market represented a significant portion of our total net revenues for fiscal the decline in demand for chipsets and boards in pc dvd applications and delays in the deployment of video networking applications which utilize our products may continue 
should they continue  this decline and these delays would continue to reduce our revenues and harm our business 
the decrease in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal was also attributable to the deferral of recognition of certain revenues by us due to our difficulty in estimating certain return levels  as well as collectibility issues with our customers 
we recorded sales returns of approximately million due to the inability of one of our distributors to sell through our products to its customers in a reasonable period of time 
net loss for the fiscal year ended january  was million as compared to net income of million for the prior fiscal year 
the net loss for fiscal was primarily caused by the decline in revenue from the prior fiscal year 
the net loss for fiscal included a charge of million to write down certain pc dvd and video networking related inventories due to the decline in demand for those products  and a provision for bad debt allowance in the amount of million due to collectibility issues relating to one of our customers and the non payment by another customer for customization services that we provided 
the following table shows certain items as a percentage of net revenues  which are included in our consolidated statement of operations fiscal fiscal fiscal net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative other income expense benefit from income taxes net income loss dividends on preferred stock net income loss available to common shareholders net revenues the following table sets forth our net revenues in each product group for the last three years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal multimedia products boards chipsets other total net revenues the multimedia products category includes mpeg encoding and decoding solutions for desktop computers as well as for pc manufacturers and add on card makers 
our board level product lines are targeted at oem customers to address the dvd upgrade market and system integrators to address the computer based training  kiosks  and corporate video on demand markets 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume oem customers building interactive multimedia products for business and consumer markets 
the other category includes set top box products targeted at the consumer internet information appliance market a market which we entered in fiscal  resale of dvd rom drives  and development revenues under agreements for the customization of certain mpeg decoding chips  which totaled approximately million in fiscal the costs related to development revenues were included in research and development expenses 
the table below sets forth our revenues by market segment for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal internet intranet video networking pc dvd upgrade chipsets other total net revenues our board level products primarily consist of two market groups intranet internet video networking and pc dvd encoding and decoding applications

the increase in other revenue was primarily attributable to increased development revenues for certain mpeg decoding chip customization  which totaled approximately million 
the table below sets forth our revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal united states asia europe canada other regions total net revenues our us revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were in fiscal  in  and in fiscal total us revenues in fiscal decreased to million  from million in fiscal total asia revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal total asia revenues in fiscal decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal our asia revenues were derived predominantly from customers in taiwan  singapore  and japan 
revenues generated from taiwan in fiscal accounted for of out total net revenues  as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal revenues generated from singapore in fiscal accounted for of our total net revenues  as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal revenues generated from japan in fiscal accounted for of our total net revenues  as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal one customer based in taiwan accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal one customer based in singapore accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal one customer based in japan accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the overall year to year decrease in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the global downturn in the pc market and the normal fluctuations in the markets for our multimedia products due to deployment cycle variations between projects 
revenues attributable to the one taiwan customer primarily represent chipsets  some of which have been resold by the customer to third parties and others have been included in boards which we have purchased for resale to other customers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  collectibility of amounts due from the taiwanese customer became uncertain as we were unable to collect amounts owed under our contractual terms  accordingly  we began recognizing revenues related to these sales after the customer has resold these products to third parties and when collectibility is assured 
these changed circumstances  along with modifications to our agreements with this customer  are expected to result in lower chipset revenues from this customer on an ongoing basis 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal excluding development revenues of million  the gross margin was approximately in fiscal  this decrease was primarily attributable to the increased provision for inventory write downs 
we may have additional inventory write downs in the future due to obsolete inventory 
the fiscal gross margin increase was a result of increased sales of chipsets  which have a more favorable gross margin compared to our board products 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased  or in fiscal over fiscal this decrease was the results of a reduction of business development group personnel  an elimination of outside public relation services  and reduced sales commissions in connection with reduced revenues 
the same expenses increased  or  in fiscal over fiscal the increase was largely due to the addition of business development staff and increased sales and marketing support related expenses in connection with our operations in hong kong and china 
we believe that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we intend to increase headcount in our sales and marketing organization and to expand our product marketing and sales development 
research and development expenses increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal the increases in fiscal and were largely due to increases in technical development support  the research and development center established in france during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect to continue our efforts in the development of our proprietary mpeg based products  and research and development expenses will likely increase accordingly year over year 
our general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal from fiscal excluding provision for bad debt of approximately million  general and administrative expenses decreased  or as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely due to the refund by our insurance company of costs previously expensed related to a shareholder lawsuit resolved in fiscal and reduction of legal expenses in general 
the same expense decreased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to non recurring professional fees associated with the settlement in fiscal from the california franchise tax board for a claim of certain tax benefits previously filed by us 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase relatively in future periods due to the increasing cost of insurance  professional services and other expenditures associated with our business 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments of million  an increase of  compared with million at january  this increase resulted from operating activities that generated cash of approximately million  and from issuance of our common stock under our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan of  which was partially offset by our payment of  for the acquisition of fixed assets  repayment of capital lease obligations in the amount of  and cash used for other investing activities totaling approximately million 
as of january   we had million outstanding under a million bank revolving line of credit that expires in october and is collateralized by funds on deposit in accounts that have been assigned to the lender 
we also have a million bank line of credit available that expires in october and is collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories  equipment  and intangibles 
this asset based line of credit had an outstanding balance  standby letter of credits to secure certain lease obligations 
this line of credit contains certain covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain tangible net worth plus subordinated debt of at least million  quarterly net income  and certain financial ratios 
at january   we were not in compliance with some of these covenants and we have obtained waivers releasing us from our obligation to meet these covenants  as of that date  however  we will be required to be in compliance with those covenants in the future 
our primary sources of funds to date have been cash generated from operations  proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  capital lease arrangements  and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
we believe that our current reserve of cash and equivalents  short term investments and the availability of funds under our existing asset based banking arrangements will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we may have to raise additional capital through either public or private offerings of our common or preferred stock or from additional bank financing prior to that time 
there is no assurance that such capital will be available to us 
the estimate of time our cash and other resources will last is a forward looking statement that is subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below  as well as other factors  and actual results may differ as a result of such factors 
factors affecting future operating results our annual and quarterly results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by us and our competitors  market acceptance of the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular  customer acceptance of our products  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular and or those of our competitors  gains or losses of significant customers  reduction in average selling prices and gross margins  which may occur either gradually or precipitously  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials for example  our source of supply for silicon wafers was interruped  and may continue to be interrupted in the future because of earthquakes in taiwan  our inability to protect our intellectual property  loss of key personnel  technical problems in the development  ramp up  and manufacture of products causing shipping delays  and availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain of our products 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to the asia pacific region  a region of the world that is subject to increased economic instability 
there can be no assurance that such instability will not have a material adverse effect on our future international revenues 
any adverse change in the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends of future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfall until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
further  we operate in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in volatility of our common stock price 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging accounting  was issued which defines derivatives  requires all derivatives be carried at fair value  and provides for hedging accounting when certain conditions are met 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb no 

no 
amended the effective date of sfas no 
to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  we have determined the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at january   we held million in short term investments consisting of us government and corporate debt securities with an average original maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at january   the fair market value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we generally expect to have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates for short term investments 
at january   we had  outstanding under a  variable interest rate bank line of credit 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased interest expense associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
the hong kong dollar and french franc are the financial currency in our subsidiaries in hong kong and france 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar and french franc 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
