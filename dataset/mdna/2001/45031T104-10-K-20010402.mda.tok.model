item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have included data with respect to ebitda  as adjusted  in the following analysis because it is a measure commonly used in our industry 
ebitda  as adjusted  represents earnings before extraordinary item  preacquisition loss  equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries  net interest  other income and other expenses  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as adjusted  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as adjusted  is not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies 
overview we provide integrated voice and data telecommunications services on a retail basis to mid size and major regional businesses in the southern united states 
we also are a leading regional provider of wholesale long haul services  which we refer to as our broadband transport services  to other telecommunications companies 
in connection with these businesses  we own  operate and manage an extensive fiber optic network in the southern united states 
we provide our retail services individually or in a bundled package tailored to the business customer s specific needs 
at december   we provided our retail services to approximately  business customers in metropolitan areas and had sold approximately  access lines  of which approximately  had been installed 
our retail services business generated revenues of million in  million in and million in our broadband transport services include the provision of long haul telecommunications transmission capacity on our network to other telecommunications carriers and the switching and transportation of telecommunications traffic for these carriers 
during  we extended our fiber network approximately  route miles to approximately  route miles 
we own the network fiber and related electronics for approximately  of our total network route miles and we manage and market under our own name the network fiber and related electronics for the remaining  route miles under long term agreements with the owners of those networks 
our broadband transport services business generated revenues of million in  million in and million in in march  we inaugurated a new line of business  which we refer to as e deltacom 
e deltacom provides colocation services  managed services and professional services integral to operating important business applications over the internet 
e deltacom also provides a wide range of optional configurations and services 
e deltacom  which began generating revenues in may  had revenues of million in operating revenues 
retail services and broadband transport services currently account for the vast majority of our operating revenues 
retail services 
we currently provide local service by using our network and facilities and by reselling the services of incumbent carriers 
since our initial offering of local service in  we have steadily increased the percentage of services we provide over our own network and facilities compared to the services we provide by reselling the services of the incumbent carriers 
we expect that this trend  which reduces our costs of providing these services  will continue during at december   approximately of the lines we had in service were provided over our own network and facilities compared to approximately at december  at december   we offered local telephone services in all of the markets in which we provided our retail services 
we expect that  as we increase our provision of local service on a facilities basis rather than on a resale basis  we will reduce the access costs we incur when we sell our end user customers long distance services and realize increased revenues from the originating and terminating switched access services we provide to other carriers that originate or terminate calls for our local end user customers 
some incumbent carriers  including bellsouth  have taken the position that  when a carrier provides local service by obtaining all necessary elements from the incumbent carrier in a combined form  the incumbent carrier retains the right to receive the access revenues generated by customers served through the use of those elements 
important issues related to this form of interconnection remain open  including issues related to when a competitor can obtain network elements used for  among other things  access purposes  and legal challenges related to these issues are likely 
we have derived  and expect we will continue to derive  an increasing percentage of our revenue from local services  primarily local services provided under our interconnection agreements with the incumbent carriers 
we expect that gross margin as a percentage of revenues associated with our facilities based local retail services will be slightly higher than the gross margin as a percentage of revenues associated with our long distance retail services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional interconnection agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that the incumbent carriers will provide the operational support required for us to provide local services to end users 
during  we reached a settlement with bellsouth of our long standing dispute over bellsouth s payment of reciprocal compensation to us for local calls placed by customers of bellsouth and terminated to our customers  including calls terminated to our internet service provider customers 
the settlement agreement provides for the settlement of all amounts claimed by us to be due for reciprocal compensation before the date of the agreement at rates consistent with or in excess of amounts previously recognized by us as revenue 
the agreement also establishes rates for all reciprocal compensation traffic on our network for the portion of that remained after the date of the settlement agreement  for and for the terms of the settlement agreement are not subject to modification by changes in law or subsequent fcc  court or state commission decisions 
the settlement agreement provided for a cash payment of approximately million  which bellsouth made in october this payment represents payment for reciprocal compensation amounts billed to bellsouth before the date of the settlement agreement and for estimated reciprocal compensation billings after the date of the settlement agreement through december  the portion of the payment related to is subject to reconciliation procedures beginning in july to determine whether the expected reciprocal compensation traffic amounts upon which the prepayment is computed have been realized 
the settlement agreement also provides for the prepayment by bellsouth of million to us in december related to expected reciprocal compensation traffic levels in this additional amount also will be subject to reconciliation procedures based upon the actual amount of reciprocal compensation traffic during in addition  we have agreed to limit our reciprocal compensation received from bellsouth to million in and million in effective may  we entered into an agency agreement with an equipment and hardware provider to market and sell equipment and hardware to our customers 
we recognize commission revenues resulting from this agreement equal to any gross margin we retain after payment to the supplier 
these non recurring revenues are combined for financial reporting purposes with revenues from sales of customer premise equipment  other equipment and software 
although we expect that a significant portion of our revenue growth will come from our retail services business  we do not expect our retail services to obtain a significant share of the market for telecommunications services in the southern united states 
the customer contracts for our retail services generally provide for payment in arrears based on minutes of use for switched services and payment in advance for local exchange and private line services 
the contracts generally provide that the customer may terminate the affected services without penalty in the event of specified outages in service and for other defined causes 
the contracts also typically provide that the customer must use at least a minimum dollar amount of switched long distance services per month for the term of the contract 
during the past several years  market prices for many telecommunications services segments have been declining 
to maintain and develop our customer base in response to these and other competitive pressures  we have modified some of our retail contracts to extend lower rates over longer terms to selected customers 
we may decide in the future to modify other retail customer contracts in a similar manner to emphasize lower pricing and longer commitment periods 
broadband transport services 
we derive commission revenues from the marketing  sale and management of capacity on the portions of our network that are owned by utilities but managed and marketed by us 
negligible incremental costs are associated with these commissions  because we use the same marketing and sales force in servicing the utility owned portions of the network as we do for the portions owned by us 
our commission revenues from these arrangements amounted to approximately million for  million for and million for we provide wholesale long haul telecommunications transmission services to our broadband transport customers on a take or pay long term basis  on an individual circuit basis  or on a month to month basis after the initial term of the take or pay or individual circuit contract has expired 
as of december   we had remaining future long term contract commitments totaling approximately million 
these contracts expire on various dates through and are expected to generate approximately million in revenues for us through proceedings affecting rights of way 
a portion of our network runs through fiber optic cables owned by the mississippi power company over its rights of way located in jasper county  mississippi 
a proceeding involving mississippi power and several landowners who have granted mississippi power rights of way in jasper county resulted in a january order of the mississippi supreme court holding that mississippi power could not use its rights of way at issue for any purpose other than in connection with providing electricity to customers of mississippi power 
we were not a party to the proceeding until after the january order 
the circuit court of the first judicial district court of jasper county  mississippi directed us on june  to cease using that portion of our fiber optic network located on mississippi power s rights of way in jasper county 
at our request  the mississippi supreme court stayed the application of the district court s order pending the mississippi supreme court s decision on our appeal 
we have rerouted substantially all of the circuits on the affected portion of our network so that  if the court s order is enforced  we expect to be able to continue to provide services to our customers along the affected route without material disruption 
the affected portion of our network  however  would not be protected by geographically diverse routing  which enables traffic to be rerouted in the event of electronic failures or total or partial cable cuts along the route 
in the event of an electronics failure or cable cut  these protections would significantly reduce the duration of any outages in the affected area 
we are continuing our search to purchase rights of way in an attempt to minimize the potential loss of route diversity for the portion of our network that would be affected by the court s order  if it is enforced 
as of the date of this report  we cannot determine whether we will be able to secure these protections at reasonable costs  within a reasonable period of time or at all 
we utilize the rights of way of gulf power company in florida for a portion of our network 
in the fourth quarter of  gulf power was sued by two landowners who claim to represent a class of all landowners over whose property gulf power has facilities that are used by third parties 
the landowners have alleged that gulf power does not have the authority to permit us or other carriers to transmit telecommunications services over the rights of way 
we are not a party to this litigation  but we would be adversely affected if  as a result of this litigation  gulf power were required to cease allowing us to use the rights of way for a portion of our network 
operating expenses 
our principal operating expenses consist of cost of services  selling  operations and administration expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services 
cost of services related to our retail services consists primarily of access charges and local facility charges paid to incumbent and other carriers  as well as wholesale carrier origination  termination and interexchange facility charges paid to other carriers 
cost of services related to our broadband transport services are substantially all fixed costs attributable to 
the leasing of dark fiber under long term operating leases  
the leasing of capacity outside our owned or managed network  which we refer to as off net capacity  to meet customer requirements for network capacity generally in areas where we plan to extend our network  and 
network costs associated with the provision of signaling system services  which allow us to monitor the status of lines and circuits on the network  alert us to events occurring on the network  and transmit routing and destination signals over the network 
cost of services for e deltacom currently consist of third party contract personnel  direct labor costs and manufacturers service contracts 
as e deltacom continues to increase its web hosting and server colocation revenues  we expect that the primary cost of services for this segment will consist of utility costs to support the data center  direct labor costs and access charges paid to carriers for access to their networkis 
selling  operations and administration expenses 
selling  operations and administration expenses consist of expenses of selling and marketing  field personnel engaged in direct network maintenance and monitoring  customer service and corporate administration 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization include depreciation of our telecommunications network and equipment and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of deltacom  inc in  our acquisition of avdata systems  inc 
in and our acquisition of bay data consultants  inc in as we expand into new geographic markets  add new branch offices and facilities  and enlarge our current service offerings  we expect cost of services  selling  operations and administration expenses and depreciation and amortization to increase 
accordingly  we expect to continue to incur operating losses at least through the end of although we anticipate that we will generate positive cash flow from operations  we expect that cash flows will be more than offset by capital expenditures at least through the end of as we continue to implement our business plan 
as we continue to use unbundled network elements of the incumbent carriers to provide services over our network and facilities instead of reselling services over the networks of the incumbent carriers  we expect gross margin on local service to continue to improve 
we expect that this improvement will result from reduced access charges and from efficiencies realized through increased reliance on the owned portion of our network 
competitive market pressures to reduce prices for our retail services  however  could offset these expected margin improvements

receipt of a one time net benefit of approximately million for related to the prior period amounts of the interconnection agreement settlements with bellsouth and million related to an interconnection agreement settlement with sprint  
continued growth in access lines installed  which increased by approximately  lines from december  to december   
continued success selling multiple services to our new customers and additional services to our existing customer base  which we believe supports our bundled approach to offering our products  
continued stability in the rate of revenue loss from former customers from period to period  and 
continued increase in the number of customers served  from  at december  to  at december  the increase in our revenues from retail services during was partially offset by a continued decrease in the rate per minute of use we charge for the services we price per minute of use  including reductions in the rate per minute of use we charge some of our large customers for these services  and by an increase in revenues from dedicated long distance services  which have a lower minute of use rate than switch services 
the effect of the rate decrease per minute of use we charged our customers was partially offset by similar decreases in our cost of services 
although providing our customers with dedicated services generates lower revenue per minute of use  we expect that this approach will provide us with a greater opportunity to sell additional value added  higher margin services  including data services  in the future 
we expect continued growth in in our retail services revenues as we continue to penetrate our existing markets and as our older markets mature

we intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the senior secured credit facility to finance working capital and other general corporate purposes and to purchase telecommunications equipment 
in connection with the completion of the senior secured credit facility  we terminated our million credit facility with bank of america  n 
a  as administrative lender  and other lenders 
in connection with the termination of the million credit facility  we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs  which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as an extraordinary loss on early termination of credit facility

in october  we executed a million operating lease with one of our primary infrastructure providers 
in december  we obtained a million capital lease facility with ntfc capital corporation 
this facility will be used to finance equipment for expansion of our network 
the initial funding of the facility  which occurred in december  was for approximately million 
each funding under the facility has a five year term commencing on the funding date 
at december   we had entered into agreements with vendors to purchase approximately million of equipment and services during and  for the year ended december   had made capital expenditures of million 
we currently estimate that our aggregate capital requirements through will total approximately million to million  including our million in commitments as of december  we expect to make substantial capital expenditures thereafter 
we expect that capital expenditures in will be primarily for the following purposes 
continued development and construction of our telecommunications network  including transmission equipment  
continued addition of switching capacity  electrical equipment and additional colocation space in connection with the expansion of our local telecommunications services for internet service providers  
infrastructure enhancements  principally for information systems  and 
the purchase of assets for our e deltacom division

closings under the agreement are subject to approval by our stockholders  waivers under or amendments to our senior credit agreements  the notes  the march notes and the november notes  regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
in addition  funding after the initial closing is subject to approval by the stockholders of powertel of the acquisition of powertel by voicestream wireless corporation and or deutsche telecom ag  which approval was obtained in march the series b preferred stock will have a stated purchase price of  per share and will accrue an annual dividend payable quarterly in shares of series b preferred stock or cash  at our option 
the series b preferred stock will be redeemable at our option beginning five years after the issue date and will be subject to mandatory redemption after ten years 
the series b preferred stock will be convertible into common stock at any time at a conversion price equal to an average price per share of common stock over a specified pricing period  plus a premium  but not to exceed 
we will also issue warrants at the closing of each funding having an aggregate exercise price that is equal to of the aggregate purchase price of the series b preferred stock issued at such closing 
the warrant exercise price will equal the conversion price of the series b preferred stock with which such warrants are issued 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  excluding million in cash restricted for capital expenditures 
we estimate that our existing sources of funds  excluding a million prepayment of reciprocal compensation we expect to receive in december pursuant to our interconnection agreement settlement with bellsouth  are sufficient to enable us to make both committed and uncommitted planned capital expenditures and otherwise expand our business as currently planned through the middle of the third quarter of we believe that these sources of funds and cash flows expected to be generated from operations  together with net proceeds that we would obtain if we issued and sold all million of series b preferred stock and warrants pursuant to the equity financing announced in february  will provide sufficient funds to enable us to expand our business as currently planned through the end of we believe that  beginning with the year ending december   our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
our ability to acquire funds in such equity financing is subject to the conditions described above 
in the event that our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  the foregoing sources of funds may prove to be insufficient to fund our currently planned growth and operations 
in addition  if we successfully complete any acquisitions of other businesses  we may be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
additional sources may include equity and debt financing and other financing agreements  such as vendor financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that additional financing arrangements will be available or  if available  that they can be concluded on terms acceptable to us 
any inability by us to generate or obtain sufficient funds would result in delay or abandonment of some or all of our development and expansion plans  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our level of indebtedness and debt service obligations are significant as a result of our issuance of the senior notes and the convertible subordinated notes and our borrowings of million under our senior secured credit facility and commitments of up to million under our capital lease facility 
the successful implementation of our strategy  including expanding our network  obtaining and retaining a significant number of customers and increasing our cash flow significantly and in a sustained manner are necessary for us to be able to meet our debt service requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our strategy or that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to improve our earnings before fixed charges or to meet our debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
our ability to meet our obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to minimal market risks

we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do not have any material foreign currency exposure 
our major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates we incur on borrowings we use to fund the expansion of our business  including million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility as of december  interest is payable on our senior secured credit facility at our option at either plus the base rate  which was at december   or plus the eurodollar rate  which was at december  the interest rates that we are able to obtain on our debt financing depend on then current market conditions 
we are also exposed to fair value risk related to our fixed rate  long term debt 
as of december   our fixed rate  long term debt and capital lease obligations totaled million 
our policy is to manage interest rates through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt and through the use of interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
at december   million of our long term debt consisted of variable rate instruments that accrue interest at floating rates 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to our million of variable rate debt at december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in our annual interest expense
