recent developments in medicare reimbursement changes to the current framework by which the federal government reimburses healthcare providers for healthcare services could have an impact on the company s revenues 
in june  the health care financing administration hcfa  acting pursuant to the balanced budget act of  published a proposed reimbursement schedule that  if implemented  would have resulted in reductions in medicare reimbursement for medical imaging services over a four year phase in period 
hcfa did not enact these reductions but has indicated that it is still continuing to evaluate these rates 
the final outcome to the proposed fee restructuring and the impact on diagnostic facilities  and on the company  cannot be predicted at this time 
starting august  hcfa began using prices submitted by manufacturers to set reimbursement for many hospital outpatient drugs  including radiopharmeuticals  rather than reimbursing these products as a direct pass through 
the company s pharmacy services business does not get reimbursement from hcfa  however  the introduction of set reimbursemnt rates could have an impact on the hospitals that purchase their radiopharmaceuticals from syncor  and that impact  in turn  could affect the company s revenues 
the company cannot predict at this time what impact these changes will have on the radiopharmacy business
