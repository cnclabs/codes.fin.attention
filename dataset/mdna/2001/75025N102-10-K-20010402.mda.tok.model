item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company including the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview the company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of integrated systems  including software  hardware and related support and professional services 
as discussed below  during the second quarter of  the company announced and began offering these products pursuant to a new subscription based pricing model 
in addition  the company offers implementation and integration services which are billed on a per diem basis 
the company s revenues from its various technology solutions are  for the most part  dependent on the number of installed sites for a client 
accordingly  while the typical sale is the result of a long  complex process  the company s clients usually continue installing additional sites over an extended period of time 
revenues from software and systems sales are recognized as products are shipped  provided that collection is probable and no significant post shipment vendor obligations remain 
revenues from client support  maintenance and other services are generally recognized as the service is performed 
in  the company began developing its new generation of management systems products wave 
this product architecture is designed to combine and expand the functionality of its site management systems and headquarter based management systems 
the company s architecture and platforms for these products are entirely web based  which the company believes will enable it to increase the functionality while decreasing the costs of implementing and maintaining technology solutions for retailers 
additionally  the company has extended its wave technology to include web enabled  centrally hosted management software and integrated purchasing software built around industry specific marketplaces 
management believes that these products will strengthen its product offerings by providing integrated  end to end solutions that span from the consumer to the supply chain 
the company intends to offer its wave software primarily through the application service provider  or asp  delivery model 
in the asp delivery model  the company would remotely host applications from an off site central server that users can access over dedicated lines  virtual private networks or the internet 
additionally  the company plans to offer the product through installations directly in client locations as client hosted systems 
the company also intends to offer internet solutions that will allow clients to utilize the internet to enhance site management and conduct business to business e commerce 
the company is continuing to develop its wave solution and to establish strategic relationships to facilitate these product offerings 
in connection with its strategy to develop asp delivered products  in april the company began converting certain new and existing products to a subscription based pricing model 
under this subscription pricing model  clients will pay a fixed  monthly fee for use of wave and the necessary hosting services to utilize those applications and solutions 
this represents a change in the company s historical pricing model in which clients were charged an initial licensing fee for use of the company s products and continuing maintenance and support during the license period 
the company began offering its products and services on the subscription pricing model in the second quarter of the company will initially continue to derive a majority of its revenue from its traditional sales model of one time software license revenues  hardware sales and software maintenance and support fees that will be paid by existing clients 
however  as a result of the transition to the subscription pricing model and the decline of revenues from legacy site management and headquarters solutions  the company expects to see a decline in the one time revenues from software license fees and hardware sales  replaced over time by monthly subscription fees 
in addition  the company expects revenue from maintenance and support from existing clients to decline and to be replaced by subscription fees as existing clients convert to the subscription pricing model 
although the company s subscription based revenues during were immaterial to total revenues  the company expects the percentage of revenue that is recurring in nature to increase substantially as a result of the change to a subscription pricing model 
this change in the company s product strategy to develop and offer asp delivered and internet solutions and the transition to a subscription pricing model involve certain risks and assumptions 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully implement these changes in its organization  product strategy or pricing model or that the changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
on april  the company effected a for stock split 
all historical share data and weighted average shares have been restated to account for this split
