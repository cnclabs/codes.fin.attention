the line of credit is unsecured 
there were no borrowings under this line at december  the company believes that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet its ongoing working capital needs 
factors affecting future results the company believes the following factors  among others  could have a significant impact on the company s business and profitability 
impact of business with major clients as set forth in item  techteam depends upon major clients for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company 
risks inherent in leasing in leasing of computer equipment  it is often difficult to determine  at the time of the lease  the expected value of the equipment after the expiration of the lease 
accordingly  variation in the residual value of equipment leased to clients and the sale price of the equipment can lead to fluctuation in the performance of techteam capital group 
competition the company faces intense competition for all of its services  including the help desk and call center markets 
some competitors have substantially greater resources  including more locations  greater financial resources  a larger client base  and more name recognition 
as a result  the company has experienced and continues to anticipate significant pricing pressure from its customers in order to remain a preferred vendor 
contract risks the great majority of the company s contracts are terminable without cause on short notice  often upon days notice 
terminations and non renewals of major contracts can have a significant impact upon the company s revenues and operating results 
reliance on senior management the success of the company is highly dependent upon the efforts  direction  and guidance of its senior management 
we do not have employment agreements with all members of our senior management 
the loss of any of these senior executives or the company s inability to attract  retain  or replace key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on it 
attraction and retention of employees the company s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor intensive 
the company s success depends in large part upon its ability to attract  develop  motivate  and retain highly skilled technical  clerical  and administrative employees 
qualified personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the company expects to experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either increased productivity or higher pricing 
techteam cannot assure that it will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future 
interruption of telecommunications services the company s operations are dependent on its ability to protect its call centers against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar event 
the company has taken precautions to protect itself from events that could interrupt its operations  but no assurance can be given that such precautions will be adequate  and operations may still be interrupted  even for extended periods 
any damage to call centers or any failure of the company s telecommunication links that cause interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  or financial condition 
the company s property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate the company for all losses that may occur 
growth through acquisitions and new products the company s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of businesses and technology sources complementary to the company s business 
acquisitions may involve special risks such as diversion of management s attention  unanticipated events  legal liabilities  and amortization of intangibles  any of which could have an adverse effect on the company s operations and earnings 
risks associated with international operations certain risks are inherent in the company s business strategy which includes plans for the global expansion of its operations 
among other things  the company may encounter difficulties in marketing  selling  and delivering its services due to differences in cultures  languages  labor and employment policies  and differing political and social systems 
in addition  the company may encounter significant effects on its operations and financial condition as a result of currency fluctuations and differing tax laws 
rapid technological changes  dependence on new solutions the company s success will depend in part on its ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in it  evolving industry standards  and changing client preferences 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in adequately addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  the company will be successful in the marketplace 
intellectual property rights the company relies upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws to protect its proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom the company licenses intellectual property 
the company enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and limits distribution of proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that the company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that its services and or software do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and that it has all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in its business  the company is subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require the company to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses of the intellectual property that is the subject of asserted infringement 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s stock has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
see market for registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common stock  quarterly variations and actual anticipated operating results  growth rates  changes in estimates by analysts  market conditions in the industry in which the company competes  announcements by competitors  regulatory actions  litigation including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of high technology companies 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating results and prospects from time to time may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event would likely result in a material adverse effect on the price of the common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no material market risk sensitive instruments nor material market risk exposures 
substantially all of the company s operations are in the united states 
the company s debt obligations have fixed interest rates and relatively short lives 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk  inherent in its sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar
