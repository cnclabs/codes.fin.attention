due to an overall increase in competition in medical professional liability insurance in texas as well as a continued trend of rising claims against the insureds  profits  and consequently  profit sharing  were lower in insurance services expenses increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to commission rates paid to sales agents which were to higher in in addition  business received through agents increased in compared to lastly  personnel costs increased in  primarily due to normal annual merit raises

investment and other the substantial rise in investment and other income was primarily due to gains from the exchanges of prime medical common stock for the company s common stock 
as part of a buy back strategy  the company exchanged  shares of prime medical common stock for  shares of the company s common stock held by two mutual fund companies 
the company s common stock was then retired and gains on the prime medical stock totaling  were recorded 
the gain was based on the difference between the company s carrying value of the prime stock and the market value of company stock on the date of the transactions 
based on an independent evaluation  the market value of the company stock was discounted  due to the large size of the transaction 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from a decrease in professional fees was partially offset by a increase in personnel costs 
legal fees were incurred in totaling  related to the uncommon care preferred stock investment 
investments and interest investments and interest expense increased over due in part to higher interest paid on a greater note payable balance 
draws taken from the company s line of credit with bank of america to fund the company s investments in syntera and uncommon care resulted in an ending balance of  at december  compared to zero at december  affiliates the company has two affiliates accounted for on the equity method 
prime medical s operating income increased in but the company recognized a smaller percentage in vs 
in as a result of its exchange of prime medical shares to acquire shares of the company s common stock 
even with this drop in ownership percentage  equity earnings from prime medical increased in the company  through its status as prime medical s largest shareholder and through its representation on prime medical s board  continues to have significant influence at prime medical and accounts for its investment using the equity method 
the company also reflects its investment in uncommon care on the equity method 
losses on this investment recorded by the company in totaled approximately  versus approximately  in such losses were expected during uncommon care s growth stage 
the cost of developing new facilities and the time to bring them to full occupancy will continue to result in losses until the established operating base is large and profitable enough to cover the expenses of new development or until there is a slowdown in development of new facilities 
the increased losses in were attributable to the ramp up of facilities construction at uncommon care during liquidity and capital resources net working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the current year is due primarily to a loss from operating activities 
in addition  the company recorded a current liability for all expected share exchange agreements with the former syntera doctors 
the share exchange liability recorded at december  was million 
historically  the company has maintained a strong working capital position and  using that base  has been able to satisfy its operational and capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from its operating and investing activities 
these same sources of funds have also allowed the company to pursue investment and expansion opportunities consistent with its growth plans 
in and  the company supplemented these traditional sources of funds with short term bank borrowings 
although it is uncertain if operating activities will provide positive cash flow in  the company believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity as well as ample liquidity in its holdings of prime medical shares to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in  the company entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na subsequently acquired by bank of america  na funds advanced under the agreement bear interest at the prime rate less  such interest to be payable quarterly 
the company pledges shares of prime medical to the bank as funds are advanced under the line 
in may  as a result of the exchange of prime medical shares for common stock of the company  the revolving credit agreement was amended to lower the total funds available to the company from  to  funds totaling  and  had been advanced as of december  and march   respectively 
capital expenditures for equipment were   and  in   and  respectively 
capital expenditures were higher in due to purchases necessary to remediate year computer issues as well as to higher expenditures for improved office space and leasing fees 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be approximately equal to those of the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  its indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  management believes that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under its bank line of credit and liquidity in its holdings of prime medical shares  will be adequate to meet the company s future liquidity needs for at least the next several years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings under the line of credit or sales of prime medical shares will generate sufficient cash to enable the company to service its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs 
inflation the operations of the company are not significantly affected by inflation because  having no manufacturing operations  the company is not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of the company s expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement 
the company is required to implement this statement effective with its fiscal year after deferral by sfas no 

statement addresses the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under this statement  the company will be required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those at fair value 
if certain conditions are met a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency dominated forecasted transaction 
the adoption of the statement on january  had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company did not hold any derivatives as of december  and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has some exposure to cash flow and fair value risk from changes in interest rates  which may affect its financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
the company does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes  but does maintain a trading account inventory to facilitate the business of its broker dealer subsidiary 
at the end of the inventory balance was  historically  the company has turned this inventory rapidly and has realized neither significant gains nor losses 
the company has notes receivable which are at an fixed rate 
their fair value will increase and decrease inversely with interest rates 
the company has debt totaling  most of which was drawn on a  revolving line of credit with a floating interest rate 
for each million that the company should borrow in  a increase in interest rate would result in a  annual increase in interest expense
