the company sold owned properties and acquired and completed the construction of properties 
the company s total net increase in owned warehouse industrial properties  was million square feet or 
the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and reflect partial period results for acquisitions  dispositions and expansions made during each respective year 
these statements also include the lease up of previously vacant space  related to the properties owned by the company as of january   and  respectively 
certain executive officers of the company had an interest in entities which were purchased by the company one property in 
these transactions satisfied the company s investment criteria and were approved by the company s independent trustees 
finally  the historical results of the company reflect the company s significant property development and redevelopment activities in which substantial capital costs and related expenses were incurred in advance of receipt of rental income 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries had million square feet of developments under construction with an estimated total cost of million that were pre leased 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries owned approximately  acres of land  as of december   for the future development of an approximately acre intermodal railyard and as much as million square feet of warehouse industrial facilities 
million of these developments were funded by the company and its subsidiaries as of december  and were not producing income 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million or over the same period last year 
in the twelve months of  of total revenues of the company were derived primarily from base rents  straight line rents  expense reimbursements and mortgage income operating and investment revenue  pursuant to the terms of tenant leases and mortgages for occupied space at the warehouse industrial properties 
operating and investment revenues increased by million in a portion of the increase was due to income from acquired operating properties and completed developments in  totaling million square feet  net of dispositions as of the end of the year 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to a full period of income from the acquisition of properties and three build to suit properties coming on line  totaling million square feet  net of nine property dispositions 
other revenues decreased million mainly due to the structuring of s merchant transactions as gains on the sale of properties rather than real estate fee income in tune with our capital recycling strategy 
gains are included as a separate item in the statement of operations 
operating and nonoperating expenses real estate tax expense and property operating and leasing expense increased by million from year to year 
million of the increase resulted from a full period of real estate taxes on acquisitions and a partial period of real estate taxes on acquisitions  net of dispositions 
the balance of the increase was due to increased leasing expenses  insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance and property management costs  which increased proportionate to the level of acquisitions and development activities of the company 
property operating and leasing costs  as a percentage of total revenues  increased from to when comparing to due in part to current and future growth of the company s operating team and operating activity on and acquisitions and developments 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  only a slight increase  due primarily to the growth of the company 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from to when comparing years 
depreciation and amortization increased by million due to a full period of depreciation on acquisitions and a partial period of depreciation on acquisitions

funds from operations ffo increased from million to million 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations as net income before extraordinary items plus depreciation and non financing amortization  less gains losses on the sale of real estate 
centerpoint calculates ffo as net income to common shareholders  plus real estate depreciation and non financing amortization  inclusive of results from merchant activitites of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures  which includes fee income  and cash gains and losses on disposition of stabilized company assets measured as the sale price  net of selling costs  less book value after adding back accumulated depreciation 
the company believes that ffo inclusive of cash gains better reflects recurring funds because the disposition of stabilized properties  and the recycling of capital and profits to new value added investments  is fundamental to the company s business strategy 
ffo exclusive of gains and losses from disposition activities decreased from million to million when comparing periods 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  should not be considered by the reader as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
on a cash basis  when comparing the results of operations of properties owned january  with the results of operations of the same properties for the same store portfolio  the company recognized an increase of approximately in net operating income 
this same store increase was due to the timely lease up of vacant space  rental increases on renewed leases and contractual increases in minimum rent under leases in place 
the company assesses its operating results  in part  by comparing the net revenue margin between periods 
net revenue margin is calculated for the in service portfolio by dividing net revenue total operating and investment revenue less real estate taxes and property operating and leasing expense by adjusted operating and investment revenue operating and investment revenue less expense reimbursements  adjusted for leases containing expense stops 
this margin indicates the percentage of revenue actually retained by the company or  alternatively  the amount of property related expenses not recovered by tenant reimbursements

liquidity and capital resources operating and investment cash flow cash flow generated from company operations has historically been utilized for working capital purposes and distributions  while proceeds from stabilized asset dispositions  supplemented by unsecured financings and periodic capital raises  have been used to fund  on a long term basis  acquisitions and other capital costs

as of november   standard and poors reaffirmed the company s investment grade rating 
the company has considered its short term one year or less capital needs  in conjunction with its estimated future cash flow from operations and other expected sources 
the company believes that its ability to fund operating expenses  building improvements  debt service requirements and the minimum distribution required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the internal revenue code  will be met by recurring operating and investment revenue and other real estate income 
long term greater than one year capital needs for property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major redevelopment projects  expansions  and construction of build to suit properties will be supported  initially  by draws on the company s unsecured line of credit  followed by the issuance of long term unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities 
management expects that a significant portion of the company s investment funds will be supplied by the proceeds of dispositions of stabilized assets  which is dependent on market conditions which presently remain favorable 
the company is pursuing several strategies to boost equity capital 
these include the monetization of the bnsf ground lease at the arsenal and the sale of senior participation in the developer s notes issued to centerpoint with respect to the development 
the company alsohas established the centerpoint venture  allowing the company to funnel deals that don t meet centerpoint s investment criteria through that entity  utilizing its million line of credit and taking advantage of additional avenues for recycling capital 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rates in the company s markets of operation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the leases are for remaining terms less than five years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rental rates if rents of existing leases are below the then existing market rate
