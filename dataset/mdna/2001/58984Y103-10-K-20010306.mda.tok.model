item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we own a portfolio of primarily upscale  full service hotels in the united states and canada 
our portfolio is diversified by franchise and brand affiliations 
during and  substantially all of our hotels were leased to and operated by meristar hotels resorts  inc as of december   we owned hotels  with  rooms  of which were leased and operated by meristar hotels resorts 
we were created on august   when american general hospitality corporation  a corporation operating as a real estate investment trust  and its associated entities merged with capstar hotel company and its associated entities 
in connection with the merger between capstar and american general  meristar hotels resorts  inc  a separate publicly traded company  was created to be the lessee and manager of nearly all of our hotels 
the eight hotels not leased by meristar hotels resorts are leased by affiliates of prime hospitality corporation 
we share certain key officers and four board members with meristar hotels resorts and an intercompany agreement aligns our interests with the interests of meristar hotels resorts  with the objective of benefiting both companies shareholders 
in order to maintain our tax status as a real estate investment trust  we have not been permitted to participate in the operations of our hotel properties 
to comply with this requirement through december   all of our properties were subject to leases involving two third party lessees  meristar hotels resorts and prime hospitality corporation 
on january   changes to the federal tax laws governing real estate investment trusts  commonly know as the reit modernization act or rma became effective 
the reit modernization act permits real estate investment trusts to create a taxable subsidiary on or after january   which will be subject to taxation similar to a c corporation 
the taxable subsidiary will allow us to lease our real property 
the reit modernization act prohibits our taxable subsidiary from engaging in the following activities 
it may not manage the properties itself  it will need to enter into an arms length management agreement with an independent third party manager that is actively involved in the trade or business of hotel management and manages properties on behalf of other owners  
it may not lease a property that contains gambling operations  and 
it may not own a brand or franchise 
we believe that establishing a taxable subsidiary to lease our properties provides a more efficient alignment of and ability to capture the economic interests of property ownership 
because of these changes in the tax laws  we have formed a number of wholly owned taxable subsidiaries to which subsidiaries of meristar hotels resorts have assigned the participating leases 
in connection with the assignment  the taxable subsidiaries executed new management agreements with a subsidiary of meristar hotels resorts to manage our hotels 
under these management agreements  the taxable subsidiaries pay a management fee to meristar hotels resorts for each property 
the taxable subsidiaries in turn make rental payments to us under the participating leases 
the management agreements have been structured to substantially mirror the economics of the former leases 
the transactions did not result in any cash consideration to be exchanged among the parties 
under the new management agreements  the base management fee is of total hotel revenue plus incentives payments  based on meeting performance thresholds  that could total up to of total hotel revenue 
the agreements have an initial term of years with three renewal periods of five years each at the option of meristar hotels resorts  subject to some exceptions 
because of these changes  we now bear the operating risk associated with our hotels effective january  financial condition december  compared with december  our total assets decreased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  primarily due to 
meristar hotels resorts repayment of a million note receivable proceeds were used to pay down debt  
the sale of three limited service hotels and use of the sale proceeds of million to repay debt  
depreciation on hotel assets  partially offset by 
capital expenditures at the hotels  
the purchase of a full service hotel for million  and 
the million increase in amounts due from lessee 
total liabilities decreased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  due mainly to 
net repayments of long term debt  partially offset by 
a million increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities due to the timing of payments  which include million in deferred purchase price related to the purchase of a full service hotel 
long term debt decreased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  due primarily to net repayments of long term debt using proceeds from the repayment of the note receivable and proceeds from the sale of the three limited service hotels 
minority interests decreased million to million at december  from million at december   due to 
current year distributions to minority interest holders  partially offset by 
current year net income allocated to minority interest holders  and 
the net redemption of operating partnership units 
stockholders equity decreased million to  at december  from  million at december  due primarily to 
the repurchase of million common shares for million  and 
the payment of dividends  partially offset by 
net income for results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  until january  substantially all of our hotels were leased to and operated by meristar hotels resorts 
participating lease revenue represents lease payments from the lessees pursuant to the participating lease agreements 
total revenue increased by million to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in participating lease revenue resulting from an increase in room revenue at our hotels under lease 
the following table provides our hotels operating statistics on a same store basis for the year change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in due primarily to 
to an increase in depreciation on hotel assets  
an increase in administrative costs  as we added personnel during to address the operating changes associated with rma  and 
increased insurance costs 
net interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from million in due mainly to 
lower capitalized interest due to a decrease in capital expenditures in 
an increase in variable interest rates during and higher interest rates on swap arrangements executed in  partially offset by 
a lower average debt balance during minority interests decreased million to million in from million in due to 
the net redemption of operating partnership units  partially offset by 
the increase in the allocation of income to minority interest holders 
in  we repurchased million of our convertible notes at a discount 
this resulted in an extraordinary gain of million million  net of tax effect 
in  we sold three limited service hotels and received million 
this resulted in a gain on sale of assets of million million  net of tax 
earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda grew million to million in from million in this growth is due to 
the increase in participating lease revenue  partially offset by 
the increase in administrative and insurance costs 
the white paper on funds from operations or ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit in october defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after comparable adjustments for our portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
extraordinary items under gaap are excluded from the calculation of ffo 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
the following is a reconciliation between income before gain on the sale of assets  extraordinary gain loss and diluted ffo for the year ended december in thousands income before gain on sale of assets and extraordinary gain loss   minority interest to common op unit holders   interest on convertible debt   hotel depreciation and amortization   diluted ffo   in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin or sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
addresses lessor revenue recognition in interim periods related to rental agreements which provide for minimum rental payments  plus contingent rents based on the lessee s operations  such as a percentage of sales in excess of an annual specified revenue target 
sab no 
requires the deferral of contingent rental income until specified targets are met 
this sab relates only to the recognition of our lease revenue in interim periods for financial reporting purposes  it has no effect on the timing of rent payments under our leases 
the effect of sab no 
was to recognize additional contingent rental income of  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
there is no year to date effect of sab no

participating lease revenue represents lease payments from the lessees pursuant to the participating lease agreements 
total revenue decreased by million to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the change in the types of revenues recorded in our financial statements in periods before and after august   the date of the merger of capstar hotel company and american general hospitality corporation and the spin off of meristar hotels resorts 
the following table provides our hotels operating statistics on a same store basis for the year change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy hotel department operating expenses were in compared to million in this decrease was the result of the hotel operations being leased to meristar hotels resorts after august   in conjunction with the merger and spin off of meristar hotels resorts 
undistributed operating expenses decreased significantly in as a result of the merger 
prior to the spin off of meristar hotels resorts  we were responsible for all hotel operating expenses 
subsequent to august   we  as owner  are only responsible for real estate taxes  property insurance and various other undistributed expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in from million in as a result of the assets acquired in the merger 
net interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from million in this increase was attributable to 
the borrowings used to finance the acquisition of hotels during  
the borrowings used to finance renovations of hotels during and 
the new debt associated with the merger  
higher average interest rates  and 
borrowings made to finance real estate ventures 
minority interests increased million to million in from million in due to 
the issuance of op units in conjunction with the merger  
the issuances of op units in acquiring certain hotels  and 
a higher amount of income before minority interests in allocated to minority interest holders 
income taxes decreased million in to million from million in in  our overall effective tax rate decreased to as a result of the effective elimination of federal income taxes when we became a real estate investment trust 
prior to the merger  our overall effective tax rate was in in  we recognized extraordinary losses of million  net of a tax benefit of million  due to the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees in conjunction with refinancing certain credit facilities 
earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda grew million to million in from million in this growth is due to 
the merger  
other hotel acquisitions which occurred during  partially offset by 
the spin off of meristar hotels resorts 
liquidity and capital resources sources of cash our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and funds from external borrowings and debt and equity offerings 
we expect to fund our continuing operations through cash generated by our hotels 
we also expect to finance hotel acquisitions  hotel renovations and joint venture investments through a combination of internally generated cash  external borrowings  and the issuance of op units and or common stock 
additionally  we must distribute to stockholders at least of our taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to preserve the favorable tax treatment accorded to real estate investment trusts under the internal revenue code 
we expect to fund such distributions through cash generated from operations  borrowings on our credit facilities or through our preferred return on our investment in meristar investment partners 
we generated million of cash from operations during uses of cash we used million of cash in investing activities during the year  primarily for 
capital expenditures  partially offset by 
proceeds from selling three limited service hotels  and 
meristar hotels resorts repayment of our note receivable from them 
we used million of cash in financing activities during the year primarily from 
payment of dividends and distributions  
the repurchase of our common stock  and 
net repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the senior secured credit facility as of december  was 
as of december   we had million available under the senior secured credit facility 
during  we repurchased million of our convertible notes at a discount 
this resulted in an extraordinary gain of million million  net of tax effect 
in january   we sold million of senior unsecured notes 
the senior unsecured notes are structured as 
million in notes with a interest rate which mature on january   and 
million in notes with a interest rate which mature on january the proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility and to reduce the outstanding debt under our term loans 
during  we sold three limited service hotels and received proceeds of million 
this resulted in a gain on sale of assets of million  million  net of tax 
we also purchased a full service hotel for million 
of the million  million was paid in cash and million will be paid from the hotel s future cash flow within the next five years 
the acquisition was funded using existing cash and borrowings on the senior secured credit facility 
capital for renovation work is expected to be provided by a combination of internally generated cash and external borrowings 
initial renovation programs for most of our hotels are complete or nearing completion 
once initial renovation programs for a hotel are completed  we expect to spend approximately annually of hotel revenues for ongoing capital expenditure programs  including room and facilities refurbishments  renovations  and furniture and equipment replacements 
for the year ended december   we spent million on initial renovation and ongoing property capital expenditure programs 
we intend to spend an additional million during to complete our renovation programs and for our ongoing capital expenditure programs 
in  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to five million shares of our common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
stock repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions and other considerations 
through december   the program has been funded primarily through proceeds from asset sales and the repayment of the note receivable from meristar hotels resorts 
as of december   we have repurchased a total of  for million at an average price of per share 
we do not expect to repurchase any more shares 
we believe cash generated by operations  together with anticipated borrowing capacity under the credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our existing working capital requirements  ongoing capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
we believe  however  that our future capital decisions will also be made in response to specific acquisition and or investment opportunities  depending on conditions in the capital and or other financial markets 
accordingly  we may consider increasing our borrowing capacity or issuing additional debt or equity securities 
these proceeds could be used to finance acquisitions or investments  refinance existing debt  or repurchase common stock 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in winter and early spring 
since the majority of our hotels are non resort properties  our operations generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
we have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations that impact the fair value of these obligations 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow at a combination of fixed and variable rates  and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have no cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes for our fixed long term debt obligations 
the table below  as of december   presents the principal amounts in thousands of dollars for our fixed and variable rate debt instruments  weighted average interest rates  and fair values by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
long term debt average average fixed interest variable interest expected maturity rate rate rate rate  n a thereafter  n a total   fair value at   as of december   we have seven swap agreements with notional principal amounts totaling million 
these swap agreements provide hedges against the impact future interest rates have on our floating london interbank offered rate or libor rate debt instruments 
the swap agreements effectively fix the day libor between and 
the swap agreements expire between september and july for the year ended december   we have received net payments of million on these swaps and other similar swaps that expired during the year 
in anticipation of the august completion of our mortgage backed secured facility  we entered into two separate hedge transactions during july upon completion of the secured facility  we terminated the underlying treasury lock agreements  resulting in a net payment of million 
this amount was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
as a result  the effective interest rate on the secured facility is 
additionally  in anticipation of the august offering of million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due  we entered into separate hedge transactions during june and july upon completion of the subordinated notes offering  we terminated the underlying swap agreements  resulting in a net payment of  this amount was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
as a result  the effective interest rate on the subordinated notes is 
as of december   after consideration of the hedge agreements described above  of our debt was fixed and our overall weighted average interest rate was 
upon the sale of our million senior unsecured notes  in january  we reduced the term loans under our senior secured credit facility by million 
at that time  we terminated three swap agreements with a notional amount of million that were designated to hedge interest rates on the term loans that were repaid 
we made net payments totaling million to our counter parties to terminate these swap agreements 
although we conduct business in canada  the canadian operations were not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows during the years ended december  and additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the years ended december  and accordingly  we were not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
to date  we have not entered into any significant foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
