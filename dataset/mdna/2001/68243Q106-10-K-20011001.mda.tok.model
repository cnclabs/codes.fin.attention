net revenues years ended july  july  june  change change in thousands net revenues telephonic    online    retail fulfillment    net revenues consist primarily of the selling price of the merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits 
growth in combined telephonic and online revenues during the years ended july  and july  was due to an increase in order volume and average order value  which resulted from more cost efficient marketing efforts  strong brand name recognition and the company s continued expansion of its non floral product offerings  including a broad range of items such as plants  candies and gourmet foods  as well as items for the home and garden and other specialty gifts

additionally  the company s combined telephonic and online sales channels average order value increased to and to during the fiscal years ended july  and july   respectively 
although net revenues generated from the company s telephonic sales channel increased during the fiscal years ended july  and july   demonstrating the benefit of offering our customers multiple channel access to our products and services  the annual growth rate declined as a result of the continuing migration of our customers to the company s online sales channel 
revenue derived from the children s group  which is included in the company s results of operations since it was acquired on june   was immaterial in relation to consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in retail fulfillment revenues for the years ended july  and july  was primarily due to a reduction in floral wholesale net revenues of million and million  respectively  as a result of the company s disposition of its floral works subsidiary in january  partially offset by an increase in net revenues resulting from the addition of three company owned retail locations during each of the fiscal years ended july  and july  the company does not expect to materially increase its number of owned retail stores in the foreseeable future

additionally  cost of revenues includes labor and facility costs related to direct to consumer merchandise production operations  as well as facility costs on properties that are sublet to the company s franchisees 
during the fiscal years ended july  and july   gross profit increased as a result of increased order volume  average order value and an improved gross margin percentage 
the gross margin percentage increased basis points during the fiscal year ended july   primarily as a result of the company s increased online service and shipping charges  which aligned them with industry norms  and the continued growth in non floral product sales  which generate higher gross margins 
in addition  the gross margin percentage during the fiscal year ended july  was further improved by enhanced customer service practices through the implementation of stricter product quality control standards and enforcement methods which reduced credits returns and replacements on floral orders 
gross margin percentage during the fiscal year ended july  declined basis points in comparison to the fiscal year ended june  due to certain introductory product pricing  and promotions related to the company s expansion into non floral products  as well as higher credits returns and replacements on floral orders during the valentine s and mother s day holidays to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty 
the gross margin percentage during the fiscal years ended july  and july  was negatively affected by the aforementioned increase in average order value on florist fulfilled orders  which  while generating higher absolute gross profit dollars  results in a lower gross margin percentage as the company s fixed service charge is spread over a higher sales price 
as the company continues to expand its higher margin  non floral business  the company expects that gross margin percentage during fiscal  while varying by quarter due to seasonal changes in product mix  will continue to increase 
marketing and sales expense years ended july  july  june  change change in thousands marketing and sales    percentage of sales marketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures  catalog costs  online portal agreements  retail store and fulfillment operations other than costs included in cost of revenues and customer service center expenses  as well as the operating expenses of the company s departments engaged in marketing  selling and merchandising activities 
marketing and sales expenses decreased to  exclusive of the non recurring charge discussed below of net revenues during the fiscal year ended july   compared to during the prior fiscal year  as a result of volume related efficiencies and cost effective advertising  coupled with the company s strong brand name and savings realized from successful renegotiations of certain of its portal agreements 
these renegotiations enabled the company to reduce portal expenses in fiscal despite a non recurring charge of million per diluted share recorded by the company in september  as a result of the modification of the company s interactive marketing agreement with one of the company s portal providers 
the company subsequently entered into a new five year  million agreement with the same portal partner  thereby reducing the company s continuing annualized expense with such partner by million 
despite the reduced spending  the company added approximately million new customers during fiscal  as compared to approximately million and million new customers during the fiscal years and  respectively 
the increases in marketing and sales expense during the fiscal year ended july  were primarily attributable to higher discretionary spending in traditional media advertising  relationship and direct marketing  additions to the company s marketing and merchandising staff  as well as additional sales personnel in support of order fulfillment and customer service activities  and additional online portal expenses associated with expanded agreements with various portal providers 
in addition  during june  in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  the company recorded a redeployment charge of approximately million 
the principal reasons for the charge included the closure of certain retail stores in connection with the company s strategic redeployment of its retail network of direct fulfillment centers and the relocation of certain customer service centers  enabling the company to meet increasing order volume requirements  while reducing costs per order 
the redeployment charge included the estimated provision for the present value of future lease obligations and related facility shut down costs in the amount of approximately million charged to marketing and sales expense  and the estimated unrecoverable book value of abandoned fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements in the amount of approximately million charged to depreciation and amortization see below 
in order to continue to execute its business plan  the company expects to continue to invest in its marketing and sales efforts to acquire new customers  while also leveraging its already significant customer base through cost effective  customer retention initiatives 
such spending will be within the context of the company s overall marketing plan  which is continually evaluated and revised to reflect the results of the company s market research  including changing economic conditions  and seeks to determine the most cost efficient use of the company s marketing dollars 
such evaluation includes the ongoing review of the company s strategic relationships with its internet portal providers to ensure that such relationships continue to generate cost effective incremental volume 
as such  although the company expects spending will increase due to the incremental marketing efforts of the recently acquired children s group  spending as a percentage of net revenues is expected to continue to decrease in comparison to prior years 
technology and development expense years ended july  july  june  change change in thousands technology and development    percentage of sales technology and development expense consists primarily of payroll and operating expenses of the company s information technology group  costs associated with its web sites  including hosting  design  content development and maintenance and support costs related to the company s order entry  customer service  fulfillment and database systems 
as a result of cost efficiencies realized by bringing web hosting and development capabilities in house during fiscal  the company was able to maintain its technology and development spending at a level consistent with the prior year  while at the same time enhancing the content and functionality of the company s web sites  as well as improving the performance of the company s fulfillment and database systems 
internalizing the company s hosting and development functions also provided for improved operational flexibility and additional back up and system redundancy 
the increase in technology and development expense during the fiscal year ended july   in comparison to prior year  was primarily attributable to development costs incurred to enhance the content and functionality of the company s web site and transaction processing systems  as well as additional payroll  recruiting and related expenses associated with the staffing of the technology department to accommodate the company s growth 
during the fiscal years ended july   july  and june   the company expended million  million and million on technology and development  of which million  million and million have been capitalized  respectively 
although the company believes that continued investment in technology and development is critical to attaining its strategic objectives  the company expects that its spending  particularly in the areas of web site hosting and development and database management  will decrease in comparison to prior fiscal years as the company continues to benefit from previous investments in its current technology platform 
general and administrative expenses years ended july  july  june  change change in thousands general and administrative    percentage of sales general and administrative expense consists of payroll and other expenses in support of the company s executive  finance and accounting  legal  human resources and other administrative functions  as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended july   in comparison to the prior fiscal year  was primarily the result of a million charge recorded in fiscal to account for the increase in the management put liability associated with the company s acquisition of the minority shareholders interest in plow hearth 
exclusive of such prior fiscal year charge  general and administrative expense decreased by million over the prior fiscal year due to various cost reduction initiatives  offset in part by increased insurance costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended july  was the result of costs associated with additions to the company s management team and administrative increases associated with operating as a public company 
in addition  an increase of million during the fiscal year ended july  was attributable to the effect of the aforementioned management put liability associated with the acquisition of plow hearth 
during the fiscal year ended july   the company recorded a charge of million to increase the liability in accordance with the acquisition valuation formula contained in the plow hearth stockholders agreement between the company  plow hearth and plow hearth management shareholders 
conversely  in accordance with the agreement  during the fiscal year ended june   the company recorded a benefit of million to reduce the related liability 
the company believes that its current general and administrative infrastructure is sufficient to support existing requirements and  as such  while increasing in absolute dollars due primarily to the incremental costs associated with the recently acquired children s group  general and administrative expenses is expected to  on a seasonally adjusted basis  continue to decline as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year depreciation and amortization years ended july  july  june  change change in thousands depreciation and amortization    percentage of sales the increases in depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended july  and july  resulted from additional capital expenditures  primarily in information systems hardware and software  as well as full year amortization of goodwill resulting from the company s acquisitions of greatfood

the company expects that depreciation and amortization will decrease in fiscal year due to the planned early adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
as such  any remaining goodwill related to the company s acquisitions will not be amortized  but instead reviewed for impairment
