comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent decrease reflects a decrease in materials revenue  partially offset by an increase in construction revenue 
our materials revenue decreased percent to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of the concrete operations on st 
thomas  tortola and dominica 
excluding the sale of these operations  materials revenue increased by  primarily due to increased demand for quarry products in st 
martin and puerto rico and increased sale of cement in st 
croix 
at this time  we cannot predict materials revenue levels in however  the total volume may be decreased due to the termination of our distribution agreement for the sale of cement 
revenue from our construction division increased percent to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity with our dredge 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was million involving projects  as compared to million involving projects at december  the backlog of the contract in the bahamas at december  was million 
we expect most of this contract not to be completed during there is uncertainty whether or not the project will receive its final financing 
therefore  the amount of the backlog could substantially diminish and timing of completion could vary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item liquidity and capital resources 
since december  we have entered into new construction and dredging contracts in the caribbean amounting to million 
we expect to complete the other remaining contracts during cost of materials cost of materials decreased slightly to percent of materials revenue in from percent in the cost decrease was due to improved sales volumes and  therefore  better margins on st 
martin and puerto rico  offset to a lesser extent by higher production costs in antigua and lower margin on our cement sales 
cost of construction cost of construction decreased to percent of construction revenue in from percent in decreased costs as a percent of revenue were due to higher profitability on some contracts  especially dredging contracts  and the completion of contracts with very low or negative margins in our gross margins are also affected by the profitability of each contract and the stage of completion

previously we had estimated we would record million for year in interest from these antigua notes  however  due to the fact that the payments received were less than anticipated  the interest recorded was million 
the decrease in payments was due to a delay in the implementation of property taxes

in the construction business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our construction services 
accounts receivable for the materials division are typically outstanding for days or longer 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs

this should result in a net cash expenditure of approximately million 
at present  management believes that our inventory of construction equipment is adequate for our current contractual commitments and operating activities 
new construction contracts may  depending on the nature of the contract and job location and duration  require us to make significant investments in heavy construction equipment 
during we sold equipment with an original cost basis of approximately  and a net book value of approximately  the net proceeds were approximately  during we also sold real property in the caribbean with net proceeds of  we realized a gain of approximately  on these transactions 
we believe we have available funds or can obtain sufficient financing for our contemplated equipment replacements and additions

at december   amounts outstanding to these lenders totaled million 
these loans are typically repaid over a three to five year term in monthly principal and interest installments
