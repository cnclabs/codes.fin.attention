the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of extensity should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview extensity was formed in november and introduced its first commercial product for general availability in march during this period  our operating activities consisted of the design and development of our product architecture and our first application  the building of our corporate infrastructure  and the development of our professional services and customer support organizations 
our first application  extensity expense reports  was released for general availability in march we released extensity travel plans in december and extensity timesheets and extensity purchase reqs in july extensity connect  our portalized application front end  role based reporting tool  and content and commerce gateway was released in march we generate revenue principally from licensing our applications and providing related services  including product installation  maintenance and support  consulting and training 
we license our applications individually or as an integrated suite of products 
the pricing of our software and services fluctuates on a per transaction basis depending on various factors  such as the number of seats covered by a contract and the degree of customization requested by the particular customer 
the dollar amounts of our contracts depend on the number of users and applications being used and the professional services requested 
our software products typically require significant customization  installation and other services 
prior to the release in july of version of our application suite  it was difficult to generate dependable estimates of the costs necessary to complete product implementations 
therefore  we accounted for our software licenses and implementation revenues using the completed contract method of contract accounting as required under the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
following the release of version in july  we were able to generate dependable estimates of the costs necessary to complete product implementations 
consequently  we are accounting for our software licenses and implementation revenues using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
in cases where a sale of a license does not include implementation services ie  a sale of additional seats or a sale of product to be implemented by a third party  revenue is recorded upon delivery with an appropriate deferral for maintenance services  if applicable 
we defer amounts billed for maintenance and recognize such amounts ratably over the maintenance period 
we have entered into two distribution arrangements under which the distributors would receive unspecified future products over the life of the arrangements two or three years in consideration for agreed upon  non refundable fees 
we recognize such fees ratably  on a subscription basis  over the life of these related agreements 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenues 
all of our customers enter into one year maintenance and support contracts when they purchase their initial extensity applications and have the option to purchase additional contracts after completion of the initial contract period 
although we do not grant any rights to our customers to return products  we do provide warranties that our products will function according to written documentation 
we promote and sell our software products through our direct sales force and through indirect channels  including jd edwards and niku 
we also have marketing referral arrangements in place with cisco systems  ibm  commerce one  webex  digital think  eventsource  visa  getthere

although cost of service revenues declined as a percentage of service revenues for the periods ended december  and  this cost has continued to exceed the amount of related service revenues 
we are seeking to reduce our cost of service revenues and are also seeking to engage third parties to provide a substantial portion of services related to our applications

there were no acquisitions made in or interest income  net interest income  net was million   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was attributed to interest earned on the proceeds from the company s ipo 
interest income will fluctuate depending upon the overall interest rate environment and our cash and cash equivalent balances 
provision for income taxes since inception  we have incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any material tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  if not utilized  expire through and  respectively

we have placed a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the realization of these assets 
the allowance totaled million at december   resulting in no net deferred tax asset 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the recoverability of net deferred tax assets and the level of valuation allowance 
when we have determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  we will reduce the valuation allowance

as we execute our strategy  we expect significant increases in our operating expenses  especially in sales  marketing and engineering 
presently  we anticipate that our existing capital resources will meet our operating and investing needs for at least the next months 
after that time  we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  execute our operating plans  or acquire complimentary technologies or businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure additional lines of credit  which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america and  to a lesser extent  in europe and the rest of the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because the majority of our revenues are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest rate risk we have an investment portfolio of money market funds and fixed income certificates of deposit 
the fixed income certificates of deposit  like all fixed income securities  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
in view of the nature and mix of our total portfolio  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december
