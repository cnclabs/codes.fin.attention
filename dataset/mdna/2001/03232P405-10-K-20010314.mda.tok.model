overview we develop  acquire and operate practice based ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physician practice groups 
as of december   we owned a majority interest or greater in surgery centers 
we operated as a majority owned subsidiary of american healthways from until december  when american healthways distributed to its stockholders all of its holdings in amsurg common stock in a spin off transaction 
the following table presents the changes in the number of surgery centers in operation and centers under development for the years ended december   and we consider a center to be under development when a partnership or limited liability company has been formed with the physician group partner to develop the center 
centers in operation  beginning of the year new center acquisitions placed in operation new development centers placed in operation centers sold centers in operation  end of the year centers under development  end of the year of the surgery centers in operation as of december   centers perform gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures  centers perform ophthalmology surgery procedures  one center performs orthopedic procedures  one center performs otolaryngology procedures and two centers perform procedures in more than one specialty 
the other partner or member in each partnership or limited liability company is generally an entity owned by physicians who perform procedures at the center 
we intend to expand primarily through the development and acquisition of additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers in targeted surgical specialties and through future same center growth 
as of march   we had acquired interests in five additional surgery centers 
on january   we signed a definitive agreement with physicians resource group for the purchase of a portion of physicians resource group s ownership interest in certain single specialty ophthalmology surgery centers for approximately million in cash 
in addition  we may purchase additional centers from physicians resource group upon completion of satisfactory due diligence and negotiation of partnership or operating agreements with the physician owners of the remaining interest 
as of december   we had purchased from physicians resource group six surgery centers and were pursuing additional acquisitions of up to three surgery centers from physicians resource group 
of these three additional centers  one was acquired in the first quarter of physicians resource group has filed for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas 
in  we disposed of our interests in two physician practices as part of an overall strategy to exit the practice management business and focus solely on the development  acquisition and operation of ambulatory surgery centers 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million  net of income tax benefit of million  in the second quarter of for the estimated loss on the disposal of these assets 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note c 
while we generally own to of the entities that own the surgery centers  our consolidated statements of operations include of the results of operations of the entities  reduced by the minority partners share of the net earnings or loss of the surgery center entities 
sources of revenues substantially all our revenue is derived from facility fees charged for surgical procedures performed in our surgery centers 
this fee varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for operating room usage  special equipment usage  supplies  recovery room usage  nursing staff and medications 
facility fees do not include the charges of the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physicians  which are billed directly by the physicians 
historically  our other significant source of revenues had been the fees for physician services performed by two physician group practices in which we owned a majority interest 
however  as a result of the disposition of these practices occurring in  we no longer earn such revenue 
practice based ambulatory surgery centers such as those in which we own a majority interest depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  to pay for services rendered to patients 
we derived approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  from governmental healthcare programs  primarily medicare 
the medicare program currently pays ambulatory surgery centers and physicians in accordance with predetermined fee schedules 
results of operations the following table shows certain statement of operations items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and revenues operating expenses salaries and benefits supply cost other operating expenses depreciation and amortization net loss on sale of assets total operating expenses operating income minority interest interest expense  net of interest income earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of an accounting change income tax expense net earnings before cumulative effect of an accounting change cumulative effect of a change in the method in which pre opening costs are recorded net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over revenues in the increase is primarily attributable to additional centers in operation in and same center revenue growth of 
same center growth is primarily attributable to additional procedure volume 
salaries and benefits expense was million in  an increase of million  or  over salaries and benefits expense in this increase resulted primarily from additional centers in operation and from an increase in corporate staff primarily to support growth in the number of centers in operation and anticipated future growth 
as a percentage of revenues  salaries and benefits expense remained relatively constant 
supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase resulted primarily from a increase in procedures over and an increased mix of ophthalmology procedures  which require more costly supplies than gastroenterology procedures  our predominant procedure type 
other operating expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over other operating expenses in this increase resulted primarily from additional centers in operation  which increased over the average number of centers in operation in as a percentage of revenues  other operating expenses decreased by 
this is due to the fact that other operating expenses includes many fixed expenses such as rents  operating taxes and utilities  which contribute to higher profit margins when same center revenues increase 
we anticipate further increases in operating expenses in primarily due to additional start up centers and acquired centers expected to be placed in operation 
typically a start up center will incur start up losses while under development and during its initial months of operations and will experience lower revenues and operating margins than an established center until its case load grows to a more optimal operating level  which generally is expected to occur within months after a center opens 
at december   we had four centers under development and nine centers that had been open for less than one year 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in over  primarily due to additional surgery centers in operation in compared to  as well as additional excess of cost over net assets of purchased operations acquired throughout and our minority interest in earnings in increased by million  or  over primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
interest expense increased million  or  in in comparison to due to an increase in debt assumed or incurred in connection with additional acquisitions of interests in surgery centers in late and throughout  together with the interest expense associated with newly opened start up surgery centers financed partially with bank debt 
we also experienced higher interest rates in compared to we recognized income tax expense of million in  compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was of net earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of an accounting change and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over revenues in the increase is primarily attributable to additional centers in operation in and same center revenue growth of 
same center growth is primarily attributable to additional procedure volume 
salaries and benefits expense was million in  an increase of million  or  over salaries and benefits expense in this increase resulted primarily from additional centers in operation and from an increase in corporate staff primarily to support growth in the number of centers in operation and anticipated future growth 
the increase was offset in part by a million decrease due to the absence of physician salaries of a practice disposed of in june  which also contributed to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenues in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase resulted primarily from a increase in procedures over other operating expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over other operating expenses in this increase also resulted primarily from additional centers in operation but was offset by a million reduction in physician practice expenses of the practices disposed of in as a percentage of revenues  other operating expenses dropped by 
this is due to the fact that other operating expenses included many fixed expenses such as rents  operating taxes and utilities  which lead to higher profit margins when same center revenues increase 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in over  primarily due to additional surgery centers in operation in compared to this increase was offset by a reduction in the depreciation  amortization of excess of cost over net assets of purchased operations and deferred pre opening cost in the aggregate of approximately million in due to physician practices sold in and the adoption in of statement of position  or sop  no 
reporting on cost of start up activities  as further discussed below 
we experienced no significant capital gain loss transactions in the net loss on sale of assets in primarily resulted from our decision to exit the physician practice management business 
in the second quarter of  we reduced the carrying value of the long lived assets of the practices held for sale by approximately million based on the estimated sales proceeds less estimated costs to sell 
the ultimate disposition of the practices  which occurred later in  resulted in no significant change from the estimate originally recorded in the second quarter of our minority interest in earnings in increased by million  or  over primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
minority interest as a percentage of revenues increased in compared to primarily as a result of the absence of physician practice revenues of the practices disposed of in which are not as marginally profitable to our respective minority partners as are our existing surgery centers  as well as increased same center profitability as a result of same center revenue growth 
interest expense decreased million  or  in in comparison to due to the repayment of long term debt from the proceeds of the public offering in june see liquidity and capital resources and a decrease in our borrowing rate due to a decrease in borrowing levels 
the reduction in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in debt assumed or incurred in connection with additional acquisitions of interests in surgery centers in late and throughout  together with the interest expense associated with newly opened start up surgery centers financed partially with bank debt 
we recognized income tax expense of million in  compared to million in excluding the impact of the practice dispositions in  our effective tax rate in and was and  respectively  of net earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of an accounting change and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
prior to january   deferred pre opening costs  which consist of costs incurred for surgery centers while under development  had been amortized over one year  starting upon the commencement date of operations 
in we adopted sop no 
 which requires that pre opening costs be expensed as incurred and that upon adoption all unamortized deferred pre opening costs be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
accordingly  as of january   we expensed  net of minority interest and income taxes  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
quarterly statement of earnings data the following table presents certain quarterly statement of earnings data for the years ended december  and the quarterly statement of earnings data set forth below was derived from our unaudited financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  which we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year or predictive of future periods 
q q q q q q q q in thousands  except per share data revenues         earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of an accounting change         net earnings         diluted earnings per common share includes a charge of  net of income taxes  or per share  for the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the method in which pre opening costs are recorded 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  operating activities for generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at december  and were million and million  respectively 
during  we used approximately million to acquire interests in practice based ambulatory surgery centers 
in addition  we made capital expenditures primarily for new start up surgery centers and for new or replacement property at existing centers which totaled million in  of which million was funded from the capital contributions of our minority partners 
we used our cash flow from operations and net borrowings of long term debt of million to fund our acquisition and development obligations 
at december   we had outstanding obligations associated with recent acquisitions of million in the form of a combination of notes payable and other obligations  which we funded through additional borrowings of long term debt in january at december   we and our partnerships and limited liability companies had unfunded construction and equipment purchase commitments for centers under development of approximately million  which we intend to fund through additional borrowings of long term debt  operating cash flow and capital contributions by minority partners 
during  we raised approximately million from the issuance of stock under our employee stock option plans 
on may   we refinanced and amended our revolving credit facility to permit us to borrow up to million to finance our acquisition and development projects at a rate equal to  at our option  the prime rate or libor plus a spread of to  depending upon borrowing levels 
the amended loan agreement provides for a fee ranging between to of unused commitments based on borrowing levels 
the loan agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends and contains covenants relating to the ratio of debt to net worth  operating performance and minimum net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  at december   borrowings under the amended credit facility were million  are due in may  and are secured primarily by a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries and our membership interests in the llcs 
during  we incurred approximately million in financing costs associated with the amended credit facility 
on june   the department of health and human services  or dhhs  published a proposed rule that would update the ratesetting methodology  payment rates  payment policies and the list of covered surgical procedures for ambulatory surgery centers 
the proposed rule reduces the rates paid for certain ambulatory surgery center procedures reimbursed by medicare  including a number of endoscopy and ophthalmology procedures performed at our centers 
dhhs initially planned to implement these new rates in the spring of however  the benefits improvement and protection act of  or bipa  made three changes to the june proposed rule 
first  bipa deferred the date on which the proposal becomes effective to january  second  bipa requires the phase in of the new rates over four years  and third  it requires that dhhs use data beginning in january based on a new surgery center cost survey from or later in calculating new rates 
we estimate that if full implementation of the new rates occurred in january  they would adversely affect our annual revenues by based on the proposed rates and our historical procedure mix 
however  we believe due to the four year phase in of the new rates  coupled with updated rates based on a new cost survey to be used in and cost efficiencies we expect to implement at both the center and corporate level  that our financial results will not be materially impacted by the rule s implementation 
there can be no assurance that the implementation of this rule will not adversely impact our financial condition  results of operation and business prospects 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we adopted this pronouncement on january   which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  released in december provides guidance for applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the implementation of sab no 
was required no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our debt instruments are primarily indexed to the prime rate or libor 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in the table below provides information as of december  and about our long term debt obligations based on maturity dates that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except percentage data 
fair years ended december  value at december  fixed rate     average interest rate variable rate   average interest rate fair years ended december  value at december  fixed rate   average interest rate variable rate   average interest rate the difference in maturities of long term obligations principally resulted from the refinancing of our revolving credit facility on may   which increased our borrowing capacity from million to million and extended the maturity date to outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  increased as compared to december  due to the acquisition of additional surgery centers 
the average interest rate on these borrowings at december  increased as compared to december  due to higher borrowing levels and an overall increase in market rates
