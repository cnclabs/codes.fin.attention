item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this annual report 
certain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this annual report including  but not limited to  matters described in this item  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in such statements 
general the company s primary business is providing financial services to individuals and businesses 
the company is headquartered in watsonville  california  along the central coast 
the bank s history dates back years  over which time the bank has built its customer base to exceed  deposit accounts 
the company pursues its business through conveniently located branch offices  where it attracts checking  money market  savings  and certificate of deposit accounts 
these deposits  and other available funds  are invested in a variety of loans and securities 
the vast majority of the company s loans at december  are secured by various types of real estate 
the bank s deposit gathering and lending markets are concentrated in the communities surrounding its eight full service branch offices located in santa cruz  northern monterey  and southern santa clara counties  in california 
the company also conducts its business by a variety of electronic means  including internet banking  telephone banking  and automated teller machine atm networks 
the most significant component of the company s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest and dividend income  primarily from loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities  and interest expense  primarily on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net interest income and net interest margin  which is defined as net interest income as a percent of average interest earning assets  are affected by its asset growth and quality  its asset and liability composition  and the general interest rate environment 
the company s service charges on deposits  mortgage loan servicing fees  and commissions from the sale of non fdic insured insurance products and investments through portola also have significant effects on the company s results of operations 
an additional major factor in determining the company s results of operations are non interest expenses  which consist primarily of employee compensation  occupancy and equipment expenses  data and item processing fees  and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by the level of provisions for loan losses and general economic and competitive conditions  particularly absolute and relative levels and changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory agencies 
as discussed under item business business strategy  the company is in the process of transforming itself from a relatively traditional savings and loan association into a community based commercial bank 
this transformation is being undertaken to enhance stockholder value while at the same time better meeting the financial needs of the individuals  families  professionals  and businesses in the greater monterey bay area of central california 
interest rate environment the table below presents an overview of the interest rate environment during the two years ended december  in mid  the federal reserve commenced what would become six consecutive interest rate increases totaling basis points  concluding in may  these increases were implemented by the federal reserve in response to strong economic growth and tight labor markets  among other factors 
the federal reserve did not adjust its benchmark interest rates including the target rate for overnight federal funds again until january  in january   the federal reserve decreased its benchmark rates by a total of basis points  in response to concerns regarding a rapidly slowing economy and a sharp decline in manufacturing activity  among other factors 
while the federal reserve took no formal rate adjustment action between june and december  the capital markets did reflect the changing economic environment 
many capital markets interest rates  such as the london interbank offer rate libor curve  peaked about may   and then commenced a gradual decline throughout the remainder of the year 
for example  the one year libor rate at may  was  declining to by december  the treasury yield curve shifted from a more traditional positively sloped curve at the beginning of to significantly negatively sloped curve by the end of the year 
inverted yield curves often present challenges to financial institutions  as short term funding rates can be higher than longer term investment rates 
yields on longer term treasuries over the past two years have been influenced by both the general economic and interest rate environment  and the federal budget surplus 
the federal budget surpluses have allowed the us government to repurchase longer term treasury securities in the open markets  increasing demand and therefore also supporting higher prices and lower effective yields 
the th district cost of funds index cofi is by nature a lagging index that trails changes in more responsive interest rate indices such as those associated with the treasury or libor markets 
index rate month treasury bill month treasury bill year treasury bill year treasury note year treasury note year treasury note year treasury bond target federal funds prime rate cofi business strategy during  the company achieved progress in its business strategy of transforming a year old savings and loan into an effective community based financial services company 
elements of this business strategy include o increasing the company s ratio of loans to deposits as a means of enhancing net interest income  serving more customers  moderating exposure to change in general market interest rates  and better utilizing the company s capital resources 
o diversifying the product mix within the loan portfolio to reduce the historic high concentration in relatively commoditized residential mortgages while also meeting the financing needs of consumers and small businesses within the company s market areas 
o enhancing the company s delivery of relationship banking  where the company s employees invest time and resources in thoroughly understanding their customers and thereby provide a comprehensive financial services solution o expanding services for businesses  including improved deposit courier service and cash management products 
o acquiring customers disaffected by the acquisition of their financial services provider 
o capitalizing on the company s position as one of the largest independent financial institutions in the greater monterey bay area 
o bolstering non interest income from an expanding list of fee based products and services  including atm surcharges  deposit account and branch service charges  and sales of non fdic insured investment products including mutual funds and annuities 
o changing the company s deposit mix to emphasize transaction accounts as a means of cementing customer relationships  lowering the company s relative cost of funds  generating fee income  and increasing the duration of the company s funding 
o capitalizing on business opportunities unique to the company s primary service areas  for example  installing remote atm s at highly trafficked tourist attractions 
o pursuing alternative forms of delivery for financial products and services as a means of attracting a greater volume of business while also improving the company s efficiency ratio 
o installing new technologies that support a greater range of financial products and services while at the same time increasing the speed  accuracy  and efficiency of the company s operations 
the company intends to continue pursuing this business strategy in  with specific goals of installing a more modern and technologically robust core processing system  expanding the recently formed commercial banking and professional banking groups  offering bilingual telephone banking  increasing customer use of internet banking and electronic bill payment  pursuing additional remote atm sites  and expanding the company s market coverage through either additional traditional  full service branches or other alternatives  possibly including supermarket banking 
however  there can be no assurance that any such steps will be implemented  or if implemented  whether such steps will improve the company s financial performance 
analysis of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  overview the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   down from net income of million realized during the prior year 
these amounts translate to basic and diluted earnings per share in  compared to basic and diluted earnings per share in the company s return on average assets decreased from in to in the company s average return on equity also fell  from in to in the overall reduction in net income during resulted from a number of factors  including a higher provision for loan losses  greater operating expenses  and less favorable results from the sale of securities 
these factors more than offset increases in net interest income and most sources of non interest income other than results from the sale of securities 
net interest income during the years ended december    and  net interest income before the provision for loan losses was million  million  and million  respectively 
the level of average interest earning assets over the same years was million  million  and million  respectively 
the net interest spread was   and  respectively  for the years ended december    and during these same periods  the ratio of net interest income to average total assets was   and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in net interest income generated in versus the prior year was primarily produced by three key changes in the company s balance sheet composition on the asset side of the balance sheet  the company redirected its earning asset mix towards loans receivable  reducing the proportion of earning assets comprised of relatively lower yielding cash equivalents  investment securities  and mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable  net  increased from of average interest earning assets in to of average interest earning assets in loans receivable  net  earned a weighted average rate of during  comparing favorably to on cash equivalents  on investment securities  and on mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the company increased the percentage of average interest bearing liabilities composed of transaction deposit accounts now  savings  and money market from in to in transaction deposit accounts present a relatively lower cost of funding than most alternative sources 
the proportional increase in average transaction accounts was offset by a decline in the percentage of average interest bearing liabilities represented by certificates of deposit 
certificates of deposit represented of average interest bearing liabilities in  versus the prior year 
the company increased its average balance of interest earning assets by million  or  in versus due to the deposit growth the company achieved during  this rise in average interest earning assets was accomplished with only a slight increase in the proportion of funding provided by comparatively higher cost borrowings 
borrowings as a percentage of average interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in the company s larger average balance sheet in versus contributed to the million rise in net interest income 
in conjunction with its business strategy  the company intends to continue its pursuit of nominal and proportional increases in average non interest bearing liabilities primarily demand deposit accounts during through a combination of enhanced marketing to businesses  redesigned checking products following the planned systems conversion  and expanded business services such as various types of lines of credit and courier deposit collection 
average non interest bearing liabilities increased from million during to million during an increase in average non interest bearing liabilities would favorably impact the company s net interest income 
average balances  average rates  and net interest margin the following table presents the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the company s assets and liabilities  the average rate earned upon each major category of interest earning assets  the average rate paid for each major category of interest bearing liabilities  and the resulting net interest spread  net interest margin  and average interest margin on total assets for the years indicated

interest income is reflected on an actual basis  as the company maintained no tax preferenced securities during the periods reported 
includes federal funds sold  money market fund investments  banker s acceptances  commercial paper  interest earning deposit accounts  and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
includes investment securities both available for sale and held to maturity 
includes mortgage backed securities  including cmos  both available for sale and held to maturity 
in computing the average balance of loans receivable  non accrual loans and loans held for sale have been included

interest income on loans includes amortized loan fees of   and  in   and  respectively 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and borrowings under mbbc s line of credit 
interest rate spread represents the difference between the average rate on interest earning assets and the average rate on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin equals net interest income before provision for estimated loan losses divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the company s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volumes of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table utilizes the figures from the preceding table to present a comparison of interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in the volumes and the rates on average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated 
changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior year average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to interest rate changes are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior year average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and changes in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume 
year ended december  year ended december  compared to compared to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease due to increase decrease due to volume volume volume rate rate net volume rate rate net dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash equivalents investment securities   mortgage backed securities     loans receivable  net      fhlb stock total interest earning      assets interest bearing liabilities now accounts savings accounts money market accounts   certificates of deposit      total interest bearing     deposits fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing     liabilities increase decrease in net interest income      interest income interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase resulted from a shift in asset mix toward higher yielding assets  the generally higher interest rate environment in versus  a decision by the fhlb sf to pay particularly high dividend rates during the first half of in conjunction with its capital management program  and a larger average balance of interest earning assets 
the larger average balance of interest earning assets stemmed from the company s desire to effectively utilize the bank s regulatory capital and liquidity in building the size of the loan portfolio 
the weighted average yield on interest earning assets increased from during to during the yield on the company s assets generally benefits from a higher interest rate environment  as the vast majority of the company s assets are either adjustable rate or fixed rate with limited duration 
interest income on loans increased from million in to million in this rise was due to a greater average balance of loans outstanding and higher average rates 
the higher average rates stemmed from both the higher general interest rate environment and the shift in loan mix away from relatively lower yielding residential mortgages and toward generally higher yielding multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased from million in to million in  as the impact of lower average balances more than offset the effect of higher average rates 
a similar pattern applied to interest income on investment securities  which decreased from thousand in to thousand in the average rate on the company s investments in corporate trust preferred securities rose relatively rapidly during due to their repricing quarterly off the responsive three month libor index 
the increase in rate was  however  insufficient to offset the impact of lower average volumes resulting from the sale of corporate trust securities with a face value of million during interest income on cash equivalents rose during  as a greater average balance was complemented by higher average rates resulting from the increases in the target federal funds rate implemented by the federal reserve 
the company maintained a higher average balance of cash equivalents during primarily due to the periodic build up of excess liquidity in support of pending loan originations and purchases 
in addition  during  the company placed thousand in short term certificates of deposit with minority focused financial institutions in conjunction with its proactive program under the community reinvestment act 
interest expense interest expense on deposits increased from million during to million during due to a combination of greater average balances and higher average rates 
the greater average balances stemmed from the company s deposit acquisition initiatives throughout the year to attract more consumer and business deposit accounts 
these initiatives included holding th anniversary celebrations at each of the company s facilities 
current and potential customers were invited to attend each of the events  at which management and directors highlighted the bank s accomplishments and strengths  and solicited additional business 
the average rate paid on deposits during increased from the prior year  despite a favorable shift in deposit mix  due to the higher general interest rate environment 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits rose from during to during interest expense on borrowings increased from million during to million during higher average volumes and greater average rates each contributed to the rise in interest expense 
the company primarily used fhlb advances as a source of borrowings during  with mbbc far less active in selling securities under agreements to repurchase during versus prior years due to the sale of mbbc s security portfolio in early provision for loan losses implicit in lending activities is the risk that losses will occur and that the amount of such losses will vary over time 
consequently  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses by charging a provision to operations 
loans determined to be losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management  at a point in time and with then available information  to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management estimates the amount of probable loss for each individual loan that has been identified as having greater than standard credit risk  including loans identified as criticized special mention  classified substandard or lower graded  impaired  troubled debt restructured  and non performing 
in determining specific and general loss estimates  management incorporates such factors as collateral value  portfolio composition and concentration  trends in local and national economic and real estate conditions  the duration of the current business cycle  seasoning of the loan portfolio  historical credit experience  and the financial status of borrowers 
while the general allowance is segmented by broad portfolio categories to analyze its adequacy  the allowance is general in nature and is available for the loan portfolio in its entirety 
although management believes that the allowance is adequate  future provisions are subject to continuing evaluation of inherent risk in the loan portfolio  as conducted by both management and the bank s regulators 
provision for loan losses increased from thousand during to million during this increase resulted from the following factors the growth in the size of the loan portfolio during net charge offs of thousand in versus thousand in the continued shift in loan mix away from residential mortgages and toward income property loans  which typically present more credit risk than residential mortgages 
specific reserves rose from thousand at december  to thousand at december  the thousand specific reserve at december  was associated with a million commercial construction loan located in the company s primary market area 
at december   the company was in the process of foreclosing on the subject collateral 
the property s construction was substantially completed at december   but the borrower experienced difficulty in obtaining an occupancy permit from local government agencies primarily due to concerns regarding the traffic capacity of nearby roads 
the increasing credit concentrations in the company s loan portfolio associated with a smaller number of comparatively larger income property loans versus a larger number of comparatively smaller residential mortgages an increase in unallocated general reserves from thousand at december  to thousand at december  this increase in unallocated reserves resulted from management s concerns about several key factors which management believes have negatively impacted the inherent loss in the company s credit portfolio  including o the california energy crisis  with impacts upon the availability and price of electricity  business costs  consumer spending and disposable income  and the pace of economic activity in the state o the financial difficulties experienced by many technology related companies in the silicon valley area adjacent to the bank s primary market areas o the impact of lower technology stock prices on consumer spending  liquidity  and investment  with a particular concern regarding effects on the demand and pricing for real estate in the bank s primary market areas o the general reduction in national economic growth and the increased volume of layoffs being announced by major corporations to the extent that the company is successful in its business strategy and thereby continues building the size of its loan portfolio while also extending increased volumes of construction  income property  and business lending  management anticipates that additional provisions will be required and charged against operations in  with the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans receivable increasing to reflect the greater credit exposure inherent in the loan mix 
non interest income non interest income declined from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to less favorable results on the sale of securities more than offsetting increased non interest income from most other components of the company s fee based businesses 
the company experienced a net pre tax loss of thousand on the sale of mortgage backed and investment securities during  versus a gain of thousand in the gains realized in occurred during the first half of that year  in a comparatively low general interest rate environment that increased the market value of the company s securities 
commissions from the sale of non insured products rose from thousand in to thousand in the company earns these commissions primarily on the sale of annuities and mutual funds to consumers in its primary market areas 
the company presently has four licensed account representatives that work for portola and assist individuals with meeting their financial objectives through an investment program 
customer service charges increased from million during to million during due to the growth in the customer base reflected in the increased number of transaction accounts combined with the implementation of a new fee service charge schedule in mid income from loan servicing increased from thousand in to thousand in the company anticipates that this source of income will decline in future periods  as the majority of the company s loan sales now occur on a servicing released basis 
during  the company may consider the sale of its agency servicing portfolio 
further augmenting non interest income constitutes a primary component of the company s business strategy 
in  the company plans to enhance its revenues from the sale of non fdic insured investment products by reviewing third party contracts  considering the licensing of additional staff  and broadening its product line 
for example  the company is evaluating the possible securities licensing of its new professional banking group members 
in addition  a new non fdic insured product program manager was hired in february  also in  the company plans to augment customer service charges by adjusting the bank s fee and service charge schedule  redesigning its checking products in conjunction with the planned systems conversion  continuing to market electronic bill payment and debit card services  further increasing the number of transaction accounts  and selling depository and cash management services to business customers who would be charged via account analysis 
no assurance can  however  be provided that the company will be successful in its plans to increase non interest income 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled million in  up million from million the prior year 
factors contributing to the rise in included compensation and employee benefits increased from million during to million during this increase resulted from a number of factors  including o the hiring of additional staff to support the company s strategic plan  including the bank s first experienced commercial loan officer 
o changes in the company s senior management team 
o the settlement of certain non qualified benefits obligations 
o a thousand accrual for a separation package for the former president and chief operating officer 
this accrual was recorded in conjunction with the applicable employment agreements between the individual and the company 
at december   the company was pursuing arbitration in this regard  as called for under the employment contracts 
o the implementation of an expanded performance based incentive compensation program 
data processing expense increased from million in to million in due to servicing a greater volume of loan and deposit accounts and processing a greater number of transactions  and because of costs associated with the planned data processing conversion 
the greater number of accounts and transaction also led to increased spending on supplies  printing  and postage costs 
the payment of thousand in expenses during the fourth quarter of in support of the planned data processing conversion 
these expenses included costs for travel  training  deconversion services from the existing data processor  and consultants assisting with the technology implementation 
the company anticipates incurring an increased level of similar expenses during the first half of as the conversion project progresses 
recruitment and relocation expenses for hiring new members of the company s management team  including a new chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller  and director of commercial lending 
the adoption of a directors emeritus program that provides cash recognition payments to retiring directors meeting certain eligibility requirements 
higher outside professional costs 
the company incurred significant legal costs  in aggregate  during in conjunction with the successful collection of a million non performing loan  a review of charter alternatives  and addressing the potential settlement of claims by the former president chief operating officer 
the company also incurred higher accounting related costs in in conjunction with an expansion of its co sourced internal audit program 
primarily because of the higher operating costs described above  the company s average efficiency ratio for increased to  up from during the transformation of the company has also contributed to increases in the efficiency ratio  as up front operating costs and other expenses must often be incurred prior to the realization of associated revenues as the company changes its business mix and redirects its sales efforts 
the company s new management team commenced a series of initiatives to improve the company s efficiency ratio during the second half of these initiatives included o the replacement of certain vendors with more efficient and lower cost providers  particularly those that interface effectively via the internet o elimination of certain discretionary costs throughout the branch network o changes to the company s ongoing operations  such as the elimination of passbook based deposit accounts and the elimination of most monthly statements on certificates of deposit o reallocating employee resources to areas providing a greater financial contribution o increasing emphasis upon variable  performance based compensation o the acquisition and installation of more efficient technology throughout the company and the integration of that technology to speed operations and improve productivity and accuracy however  due to the time required to conclude existing contractual obligations  implement these initiatives including employee training  and conduct required customer notification  many of the above initiatives provided little economic benefit during the company cannot predict whether the above initiatives will be successfully implemented  and if implemented  whether they will produce a sufficient benefit to offset other factors that might work to increase the efficiency ratio  including the implementation of the company s strategic plan 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from million during to million during due to a reduction in pre tax income 
the company s effective book tax rate increased slightly in  in part due to the greater impact of non deductible expenses and other tax related adjustments on a lower base of pre tax income 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
investment securities declined from million at december  to million at december  due to the sale of a corporate trust preferred security during in order to generate funding for the company s increasing loan portfolio 
the company s investment security portfolio at december  was composed of two variable rate  quarterly repricing  corporate trust preferred securities issued by major us banks 
these two securities were rated a or better by standard poors rating agency at december  management may consider selling these two securities in in order to bolster the bank s qualified thrift lender ratio  shift funds into assets that function as more effective collateral under secured borrowing arrangements  and provide funds for further expansion in loans receivable 
mortgage backed securities declined from million at december  to million at december  this reduction stemmed from ongoing principal repayments including prepayments  maturities  and the sale of mortgage backed securities with a face value of million  partially offset by purchases during the year 
the company decreased the size of its mortgage backed security portfolio during to raise funds for investment into higher yielding loans receivable  improve the interest rate risk profile of the company  and generate additional liquidity for mbbc 
the company significant altered the mix of its mortgage backed securities portfolio during traditional agency pass through certificates declined from of total mortgage backed securities at december  to at december  in contrast  cmos increased from of total mortgage backed securities at december  to at december  the company undertook this change in mix o to reallocate the company s capacity for longer term  fixed rate assets from the security portfolio to the loan portfolio  where management believes better yields are obtainable for the same level of interest rate risk o to acquire cmos that present relatively more certain cash flows eg planned amortization classes  or pacs than traditional pass through certificates and thereby facilitate the company s cash management o to take advantage of the generally higher yields available in non agency cmos versus those presented by similar profile agency securities all of the cmos were rated aaa by at least one nationally recognized ratings agency at december  loans receivable held for investment  net of allowances for loan losses  were million at december   compared to million at december  this increase stemmed from million in credit commitments during  partially offset by repayments and sales 
the mix in the portfolio of loans receivable held for investment  net  changed significantly during  with a reduced concentration in residential mortgages and a significant increase in the proportion of income property loans multifamily and commercial real estate 
this change in loan mix was pursued in conjunction with the company s strategic plan of transforming itself into a community commercial bank  and thereby financing a broader range of credit needs in the communities served 
this change in mix also supports a greater yield on the loan portfolio and an increase in deposits  as the company seeks to acquire operating accounts for income properties financed and for businesses receiving a line of credit or term business loan 
in  the company intends to continue pursuing this pattern of change in loan mix 
should market conditions prove favorable  management may pursue an increase in the percentage of total loans represented by construction loans 
construction loans represented of gross loans at december  while the bank had an excess of qualifying assets over its qualified thrift lender test minimum requirement at december   to the extent the bank is successful in continuing to alter its loan mix  it may need to consider changing to a commercial bank charter in the future 
the company s investment in the capital stock of the fhlb declined in due to a mandatory redemption required by the fhlb 
the company s balance of premises and equipment  net  increased by thousand in primarily due to leasehold improvements at one branch 
this branch was remodeled to enable the leasing of the second floor to a tenant  thereby increasing the company s future monthly rental income 
management anticipates a further increase in premises and equipment in as a result of computer hardware and software purchases and licensing in conjunction with the planned new core processing system 
the company continued to amortize its intangible assets during  reducing their balance from million at december  to million at december  this amortization  which is a non cash charge to operations  bolsters the bank s regulatory capital ratios all else held constant  as intangible assets are deducted from gaap capital in determining regulatory capital 
this amortization also increases the company s tangible book value per share 
at december   the company maintained thousand in originated mortgage servicing rights  down from thousand a year earlier 
because the company has adopted a program of generally selling its loans on a servicing released basis  management anticipates that the balance of originated mortgage servicing rights will continue to decline as the existing portfolio of loans serviced for others pays off 
during the year ended december   the company s liabilities increased by million to million  from million at december  an increase in deposits more than offset declines in other types of liabilities 
total deposits rose from million at december  to million at december  this increase resulted from multiple factors  including the introduction of new checking and money market products and the acquisition of million in certificates of deposit through the state of california time deposit program 
the bank was also successful in attracting some deposit customers during from local competitors undergoing a merger or acquisition 
fhlb advances declined from million at december  to million at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase declined from million at december  to none at december  the inflow of deposits and the reduction in securities provided sufficient funds to fund the growth in loans receivable  retire maturing borrowings  and prepay certain borrowings during the company did not pursue extensive leveraging via wholesale assets and liabilities during  as management determined that available risk adjusted spreads in the capital markets did not support the associated allocation of capital 
stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december   even with the repurchase of million in treasury shares during and the payment of thousand in cash dividends during the first quarter of the rise in equity resulted from net income  continued amortization of deferred stock compensation  company directors receiving their fees in company stock  and an improvement in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale 
the company reduced its aggregate deferred stock compensation by million during this significant reduction was caused by o esop shares continuing to be committed to be released under the terms of that tax qualified plan o the distribution of certain non qualified deferred compensation payable in company stock o the acceleration of benefits under the recognition and retention plan for outside directors leading to the termination of that plan and the savings of future related administrative expense o continued vesting of shares previously awarded under the performance equity plan for officers and employees o the use of company stock for incentive payments in lieu of cash under certain employee incentive plans management intends to continue pursuing the accelerated amortization of deferred stock compensation and the award of company shares in lieu of certain cash incentive payments during as a means of increasing employee ownership  more closely aligning employee interests with those of stockholders  enhancing the company s equity position  and increasing the company s tangible book value per share 
the board of directors determined in early to amend the company s bylaws to mandate a minimum direct ownership of company shares by the members of the board of directors and to continue requiring the payment of director fees in company stock 
the board of directors took these steps to highlight their support for the company and to communicate their acknowledgement of the importance of aligning the board of directors with stockholder interests 
given the bank s favorable regulatory capital position at december   the indefinite suspension of cash dividends by the company during  and the additional liquidity and capital available at mbbc at december   management anticipates pursuing opportunities to expand the balance sheet during the board of directors plans to evaluate the merits of periodic stock repurchases during analysis of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  overview the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   up significantly from net income of million realized during the prior year 
these amounts translate to basic and diluted earnings per share in  respectively  and basic and diluted earnings per share in  respectively 
the company s return on average assets improved from in to in due to the company s equity management program  return on average equity improved more dramatically  rising from in to in the increase in net income resulted from the company s continued progress and success in implementing its business strategy  complemented by a strong economy and vibrant local real estate markets  which helped constrain loan delinquencies  net charge offs  and expenses associated with foreclosed real estate 
net interest income during the years ended december   and  net interest income before the provision for loan losses was million and million  respectively 
the level of average interest earning assets over the same years was million and million  respectively 
the net interest spread was and  respectively  during the years ended december  and during these same periods  the ratio of net interest income to average total assets was and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in net interest income generated in compared to the prior year was primarily produced by three key changes in the company s balance sheet composition on the asset side of the balance sheet  the company significantly redirected its asset mix towards loans receivable  reducing the proportion of the balance sheet comprised of lower yielding cash equivalents  investment securities  and mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable produced a weighted average yield rate of during  comparing favorably to on cash equivalents  on investment securities  and on mortgage backed securities 
this change in asset mix was enabled by a credit commitment volume of million accomplished in  partially offset by repayments and sales  that was primarily funded by the sale of securities and increased borrowings 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the company significantly reduced the percentage of deposits represented by relatively higher cost certificates in favor of a larger proportion of transaction accounts 
certificates of deposit  which generated a weighted average cost of in and in  declined from of average interest bearing deposits in to in the company successfully offset the decline in certificates of deposit with increases in lower cost checking and money market accounts 
by comparison  money market accounts produced an average cost of funds of in and in at december   certificates of deposit comprised of total deposits  down from a year earlier 
the company increased its average balance of interest earning assets by million  or 
the company funded this balance sheet expansion largely with an increase in borrowings  as overall deposit growth was limited by the company s objective of decreasing its cost of deposits relative to key capital market indices such as cofi and the year treasury yield 
the company was successful in this regard  as the weighted average cost of deposits declined from at december  to at december   while at the same time the cofi index rose from to and the year treasury yield rose from to 
interest income for the year ended december   interest income was million  an increase of million  or  over the amount recorded for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in interest income during was growth in average outstanding balances of loans receivable  which in turn stemmed from the level of loan production recorded during interest income on loans receivable  which accounted for of total interest income for the year ended december   grew by million in compared to interest income on mortgage backed securities during declined by million from the prior year due to reduced average volumes outstanding 
during  the company used scheduled payments  prepayments  and sales of mortgage backed securities as sources of cash to fund the expanding portfolio of loans receivable 
similarly  lower average volumes of investment securities during versus the prior year led to a million year to year decline in interest income on investment securities 
the weighted average yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the yield on interest earning assets was principally due to loans receivable increasing as a percentage of interest earning assets  from during to during yields on mortgage backed and investment securities increased slightly during  but represented a significantly smaller portion of total interest earning assets 
the increase in general market interest rates that occurred in also bolstered the company s yield on interest earning assets  particularly those portfolios such as construction loans and corporate trust preferred securities that reprice based upon relatively responsive indices such as prime and libor  respectively 
the weighted average nominal rate on the company s loan portfolio increased from at december  to at december  interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the decline in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in the company s average cost of deposits  which was a result of a combination of the change in deposit mix and from the company s adopting a less aggressive pricing strategy  particularly for certificates of deposit  than had been employed in prior periods 
the company s average cost of interest bearing deposits declined to in  from in interest expense on fhlb advances rose from million in to million in  as the impact of greater average balances outstanding more than offset the effect of a decline in the average rate paid 
provision for loan losses for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was thousand  compared to thousand for the year ended december  during  the amount and timing of provisions for loan losses were primarily generated the following key factors o the increasing absolute size of the loan portfolio o the continuing change in mix within the loan portfolio  away from residential mortgages to other types of lending  particularly construction loans and mortgages secured by commercial and industrial real estate o a rise in criticized assets and classified assets from million and million  respectively  at december  to million and million  respectively  at december  o net charge offs of thousand recorded in  versus net recoveries of thousand in construction  commercial real estate  multifamily  and business lending generally involve a greater risk of loss than do mortgages on single family residences 
the company s allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   comprised of million in general reserves and thousand in specific reserves 
this compares to an allowance of million at december   all but thousand of which was in general reserves 
the allowance represented of loans receivable at december   compared to a year earlier 
non interest income non interest income increased by to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to o a rise in net gains on the sale of mortgage backed and investment securities from thousand in to thousand in o customer service charges increasing from thousand in to million in o commissions from the sale of non fdic insured products rising from thousand in to thousand in the company sold mortgage backed and investment securities in as a means of funding expansion in the loan portfolio and in order to moderate the company s exposure to increases in general market interest rates 
the increase in customer service charges in was primarily due to a larger customer base and a higher number of transaction related customer deposit accounts 
the increase in commission income from sales of noninsured products reflects more effective cross selling of these products to the company s customer base 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and factors contributing to the rise in included o the operation of the felton branch for all of  versus eight months in o the addition of staff to support the company s greater volumes of loan origination  loan servicing  and deposit account transactions o increased commission expense associated with greater sales of non fdic insured investment products o higher incentive payments associated with the company s sales and financial success in o greater postage and data and item processing costs driven by an increased volume of transaction deposit accounts o non recurring costs of thousand associated with a single operating loss stemming from the operation of non qualified benefit plans provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to million during this rise was entirely associated with an increase in pre tax income in versus  as the company s effective tax rate declined modestly in versus the prior year 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or investment securities declined from million at december  to million at december  due to sales conducted in order to generate funding for the company s increasing loan portfolio 
the company s investment security portfolio at december  was entirely composed of variable rate trust preferred securities 
mortgage backed securities declined from million at december  to million at december  this reduction stemmed from ongoing principal repayments and million in sales 
this decrease was accomplished in conjunction with management s strategy of reducing interest rate risk and increasing the overall yield of interest earning assets by selling longer duration and comparatively lower yielding mortgage backed securities and reinvesting into shorter duration and higher yielding loans receivable 
loans receivable held for investment  net  were million at december   compared to million at december  this increase stemmed from million in credit commitments during  partially offset by repayments and sales  of which the largest category was construction loans with million in new credit commitments 
construction loans net of undisbursed loan funds rose from million at december  to million at december   thereby accounting for of the overall rise in net loans receivable accomplished during commercial and industrial real estate loans increased from million at december  to million at december  in conjunction with the company s business strategy 
at december   residential mortgages continued to be the largest single category of the company s net loans receivable held for investment  totaling million  or of the portfolio 
this percentage compares to at december  the company continued to amortize its intangible assets during  reducing their balance from million at december  to million one year later 
this amortization  which is a non cash charge to operations  enhances the bank s regulatory capital ratios  as intangible assets are deducted from gaap capital in determining regulatory capital 
during the year ended december   the company s liabilities increased by million to million  from million at december  the increase in liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of million  or  in advances from the fhlb 
the increase in advances was used primarily to fund the growth in loans receivable 
none of the company s advances at december  were putable  thereby exposing the company to increased funding costs in a rising interest rate environment 
deposits decreased to million at december  from million at december   as the company focused upon changing its deposit mix and reducing its average cost of deposits in priority over building nominal deposit balances 
shareholders equity declined million from million at december  to million one year later 
the decrease in equity occurred despite record earnings by the company  as  during o the company repurchased  of its outstanding shares  which decreased shareholders equity by million o accumulated other comprehensive income declined by million due to reduced market values for the company s security portfolios  which in turn stemmed from the increasing interest rate environment and the relatively high duration of a significant portion of the mortgage backed securities portfolio o the company paid thousand in cash dividends o the company acquired thousand of its stock in conjunction with its non qualified stock compensation plans liquidity liquidity is actively managed to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet the ongoing needs of both the mbbc and the bank 
liquidity management includes projections of future sources and uses of funds to ensure the availability of sufficient liquid reserves to provide for unanticipated circumstances 
the bank s primary sources of liquidity are deposits  principal and interest payments including prepayments on its asset portfolios  retained earnings  fhlb advances  other borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  sales of loans originated for sale and securities classified as available for sale 
the bank s primary uses of funds include loan originations  customer drawdowns on lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan commitments  loan purchases  customer withdrawals of deposits  interest paid on liabilities  and operating expenses 
during  the bank increased its sources of liquidity and funding by o arranging four federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks in an aggregate amount of million 
funds under these lines are provided on an available  as opposed to on a committed  basis 
o completing agreements to be able to issue dtc or publicly traded certificates of deposit through two large investment banks with significant national retail client bases 
o signing psa agreements with a greater number of approved counterparties to facilitate the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase 
o pledging multifamily loans to the fhlb sf to increase the bank s borrowing capacity 
o participating in the state of california time deposit program 
o distributing its security collateral to optimize its sources of funding and the cost of its funding 
the bank pledges excess collateral to the fhlb in order to have ready access to additional liquidity 
at december   the bank maintained available borrowing capacity in excess of million at the fhlb 
in addition  at december   the bank owned a significant volume of unpledged loans and securities which could be used for either liquidation or secured borrowings in order to meet future liquidity requirements 
from time to time  depending upon its asset and liability strategy  the bank converts a portion of its residential whole loans into mortgage backed securities 
these conversions provide increased liquidity because the mortgage backed securities are typically more readily marketable than the underlying loans and because they can more effectively be used as collateral for borrowings 
the bank did not securitize any portion of its residential mortgages during the company s ratio of loans to deposits at december  was 
to the extent the company is successful in its strategic plan and further increases this ratio as a means of increasing average asset yields and the percentage of total assets comprised of loans  the bank may need to seek alternative sources of liquidity and funding 
following the planned systems conversion in  the bank intends to pursue the specific pledging of individual loans to the fhlb versus blanket lien  thereby increasing the volume and types of loans eligible as collateral  increasing the financial efficiency of the pledging  and augmenting the bank s borrowing capacity 
throughout  the bank maintained a regulatory liquidity ratio in excess of that required by the ots 
the bank s strategy generally is to maintain its liquidity ratio slightly above the required minimum in order to maximize its yield on alternative investments 
at december   the bank maintained million in commitments to fund loans 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet these commitments  not all of which will necessarily be drawn upon 
mbbc  as a company separate from the bank  must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of mbbc s cash inflows are obtained from principal and interest payments on loans  interest on its security and cash equivalent positions  repayment of the funds advanced for the esop  exercise of vested stock options  sales of treasury shares to the bank for subsequent payment as director fees  and dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to mbbc 
as of december   mbbc did not have any commitments for capital expenditures or to fund loans 
as discussed under item business capital requirements and capital categories  the bank was informed by the ots during the first quarter of that it would be required to maintain its regulatory capital ratios at levels equal to or above those reported at december  this additional regulatory capital requirement may limit the bank s ability to pay dividends to mbbc until the requirement is terminated by the ots 
during  mbbc improved its liquidity by o collecting in full on a million business term loan that was non performing at december  o arranging a committed million line of credit from a correspondent bank  secured by thousand shares of treasury stock at december   mbbc had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this figure increased by over thousand in january  due to the exercise of vested stock options 
capital resources the bank s position as a well capitalized financial institution under the pca regulatory framework is further enhanced by the financial resources present at the mbbc holding company level 
at december   the consolidated gaap capital position of the bank was million  while the consolidated gaap capital position of the company was million 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning the bank s regulatory capital position  including amounts by which the bank exceeds minimum and well capitalized thresholds for regulatory capital  and the amount by which the bank exceeds the institution specific regulatory capital requirements established by the ots in the first quarter of management believes the bank s regulatory capital position in will continue to benefit from three key factors o the continued amortization of intangible assets o the continued amortization of deferred stock compensation o the bank s earnings for the year the potential continued increase in the size of the loan portfolio  combined with the ongoing planned shift in mix toward construction  income property  and business lending  may result in the bank s having higher levels of nominal and risk weighted assets during  thereby possibly offsetting the effect of the above three factors upon regulatory capital ratios 
the company has conducted share repurchases since through december   the company had repurchased a cumulative and gross  shares of its common stock 
at december   there were  shares outstanding 
during january  vested stock options representing  shares were exercised 
the company issued the shares associated with these options from treasury stock  thereby increasing the total shares outstanding 
the board of directors considers the appropriateness of additional share repurchases on an ongoing basis 
the company paid cash dividends of per share in and per share in as previously announced  during mid the board of directors determined to indefinitely suspend the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
in making this decision  the board of directors expressed their belief that alternative uses of mbbc s capital and liquidity presented more favorable financial results and impacts upon stockholder value 
during the fourth quarter of  mbbc invested an additional million into the bank to support the implementation of the strategic plan and the bank s potential growth in impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the measurement of most financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  the company s assets and liabilities are nearly all monetary in nature 
consequently  relative and absolute levels of interest rates present a greater impact on the company s performance and condition than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
the company s operating costs  however  are subject to the impact of inflation  particularly in the case of salaries and benefits costs  which typically constitute almost one half of the company s total non interest expense 
during  relatively low unemployment rates contributed to increased salary and benefits costs  especially as the company sought to continue expanding its business generation while also attracting experienced financial services industry employees to facilitate and accelerate its strategic transformation into a community based financial services firm

sfas no

for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures about securitizations and collateral  this statement was adopted as of december  and did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
the results of operations for financial institutions such as the company may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including rapid changes in interest rates  declines in real estate market values  and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
interest rate risk irr and credit risk typically constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for banks and thrifts 
for a discussion of the company s credit risk  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for loan losses 
the company utilizes no derivatives to mitigate either its credit risk or its irr  instead relying on loan review and adequate loan loss reserves in the case of credit risk and portfolio management techniques in the case of irr 
the company is not significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or other market risks other than interest rate risk 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of general market interest rates might have upon the company s net interest income  results of operations  and theoretical liquidation value  also called net portfolio value npv 
interest rate changes impact earnings and npv in many ways  including effects upon the yields generated by variable rate assets  the cost of deposits and other sources of funds  the exercise of options embedded in various financial instruments especially residential mortgages  and customer demand for and market supply of different financial assets  liabilities  and positions 
in order to manage irr  the company has established an asset liability management committee alco  which includes representatives from senior management and the board of directors 
alco is responsible for managing the company s financial assets and liabilities in a manner which balances profitability  irr  and various other risks eg liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by and periodically reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
the primary objective of the company s irr management program is to maximize net interest income while controlling irr exposure to within prudent levels 
financial institutions are subject to irr whenever assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times repricing  or gap  risk  based upon different capital markets indices basis risk  for different terms yield curve risk  or are subject to various embedded options  such as the right of mortgage borrowers to refinance their loans when general market interest rates decline 
companies with high concentrations of real estate lending  such as the company  are significantly impacted by prepayment rates on loans  as such prepayments generally return investable funds to the company at a time of relatively lower prevailing general market interest rates 
decisions to control or accept irr are analyzed with consideration of the probable occurrence of future interest rate changes 
stated another way  irr management encompasses the evaluation of the likely additional return associated with an incremental change in the irr profile of the company 
for example  having liabilities that mature or reprice faster than assets can be beneficial when interest rates decline  but may be detrimental when interest rates rise 
assessment of potential changes in market interest rates and the relative financial impact to earnings and npv is used by the company to help quantify and manage irr 
as with credit risk  the complete elimination of irr would curtail the company s profitability  as the company generates a return  in part  through effective risk management 
the company monitors its interest rate risk using various analytical methods that include participation in the ots net portfolio value interest rate risk modeling 
the company s exposure to irr as of december  was well within the limits established by the board of directors 
a common  if analytically limited  measure of financial institution irr is the institution s static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted by off balance sheet positions  if any which are expected to mature or reprice within a specified period 
a static gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities in a given time period or cumulatively through that time period 
the converse is true for a negative static gap 
the following table presents the maturity and rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the repricing gap figures in the table reflect the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that are contractually scheduled to mature or reprice whichever occurs first during future periods 
at december  more than more than more than non months months year years over interest or less to year to years to years years bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest earning cash   equivalents investment securities   mortgage backed securities   loans receivable  net of lip       fhlb stock   gross interest earning assets       less unamortized yield adjustments allowance for loan losses   interest earning assets        non interest earning assets   total assets        liabilities and equity now accounts   savings accounts   money market accounts   certificates of deposit      total interest bearing deposits      fhlb advances     other borrowings total interest bearing       liabilities non interest bearing liabilities   shareholders equity   total liabilities and equity        periodic repricing gap      cumulative repricing gap      periodic repricing gap as a of interest earning assets cumulative repricing gap as a of interest earning assets cumulative net interest earning assets as a of cumulative interest bearing liabilities as presented in the prior table  at december   the company s cumulative one year and three year static gaps  based upon contractual repricing and maturities ie ignoring prepayments and other non contractual factors were and  respectively  of total interest earning assets 
these figures suggest that net interest income would increase if general market interest rates were to decline and vice versa  reflecting a net liability sensitive position 
however  static gap analysis such as that presented above fails to capture material components of irr  and therefore provides only a limited  point in time view of the company s irr exposure 
the assumptions and factors which are by definition excluded from static gap analysis prepared on a contractual basis encompass o prepayments on assets o how rate movements and the shape of the treasury curve  or the libor swap curve  affect borrower behavior o that all loans and deposits repricing at a given time will not adjust to the same degree or by the same magnitude o that the nature of rate changes for assets and liabilities in the over one year category have a greater long term economic impact than those for shorter term assets and liabilities o transaction deposit accounts significant to the company do not have scheduled repricing dates or contractual maturities  and therefore may respond to interest rate changes differently than other financial instruments o potential company strategic and operating responses to changes in absolute and relative interest rate levels o the financial impact of options embedded in various financial instruments another measure of irr  required to be performed by insured depository institutions regulated by the ots  is a procedure specified by thrift bulletin a  interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact upon npv of an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in basis point increments 
the following table presents the estimated impacts of such changes in interest rates upon the company as of december   calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin a 
however  the results from any cash flow simulation model are dependent upon a lengthy series of assumptions about current and future economic  behavioral  and financial conditions  including many factors over which the company has no control 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  prepayment rates on various asset portfolios and decay rates on core deposits  including savings  checking  and money market accounts 
because of the uncertainty regarding the accuracy of assumptions utilized and because such an analytical technique does not contemplate any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in interest rates  no assurance can be provided that the valuations presented in the following table are representative of what might actually be obtainable 
in addition  the following figures are by definition not indicative of the company s economic value as a going concern or of the company s market value 
projected change in change in interest rates in basis points npv dollars percent dollars in thousands base scenario  the prior table results show that the company s liquidation value is relatively balanced in its exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
the prior table also highlights that the company s highest theoretical liquidation value occurs in the base scenario 
this position primarily results from the embedded options  held by borrowers  within most mortgage related products  as described in the following two paragraphs 
under rising interest rates  the company s assets experience a lengthening of duration relative to the liability side  resulting in a reduction of npv 
this occurs due to the slower prepayment behavior under rising rates the analysis assumed on mortgage related assets  in conjunction with embedded options such as periodic and lifetime rate adjustment caps on adjustable rate loans  all of which work to constrain aggregate asset repricing relative to liabilities and reduce npv 
such results are directionally consistent with the static gap analysis presented above 
under falling interest rates  the company s assets experience a shortening of duration relative to the liability side  resulting in a reduction in npv 
this occurs due to the faster prepayment behavior under falling rates the analysis assumed on mortgage related assets  as borrowers take advantage of a lower interest rate environment to refinance their loans 
this assumed refinancing provides cash flow into the company at a time when reinvestment alternatives present lower rates than the assets being paid off 
a significant portion of the company s total irr exposure at december  was concentrated in two asset portfolios mortgage backed securities and long term  fixed rate residential mortgages held for investment 
within the mortgage backed securities portfolio  a relatively small number of securities represent a disproportional amount of the irr exposure  particularly a few high duration cmo s that contain relatively greater maturity extension risk 
the company has  over the past several years  generally exhibited a greater degree of interest rate risk than presented in the above table  particularly in its exposure to rising interest rate scenarios 
during  the company s irr exposure has been reduced through a combination of several strategies  including o increasing core deposits  particularly checking accounts  as a means of increasing the weighted average duration of the company s funding o originating and retaining variable rate loans  including those tied to relatively responsive capital markets indices such as the year cmt and the wall street journal prime rate o selling fixed rate mortgage backed securities from the available for sale portfolio to fund loan growth o concentrating new security purchases in relatively low duration  high cash flow  strongly structured cmo s o selling the vast majority of the new production of fixed rate  residential mortgages into the secondary market o continuing to diversify the loan portfolio away from its historic concentration in residential mortgages towards increased income property lending  which typically generates more interest sensitive  and higher yielding  assets despite the company s irr management program and the initiatives detailed above  due to the multiple factors which influence the company s exposure to irr  many of which are beyond the control of the company  there can be no assurance that the company s earnings or economic value will be maintained in future periods  nor that the company will be successful in continuing to maintain a relatively balanced irr exposure
