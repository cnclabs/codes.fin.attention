item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes associated with them contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future 
such discussion represents only the best present assessment by management of the company 
the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by our success in acquiring oil and gas properties and our ability to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production through exploration and exploitation activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices have also significantly affected the results of operations 
on december   the company through its newly formed owned subsidiary  bluebird  acquired from spirit energy spirit natural gas reserves and associated assets in producing fields located in oklahoma and texas 
as part of the capitalization of bluebird  the company contributed  units of tel offshore trust 
bluebird  as an unrestricted subsidiary as defined under certain credit agreements  is neither a guarantor of the company s senior notes due nor can it be included in determining compliance with certain financial covenants under the company s credit agreements 
on june   the company and bluebird acquired oil and gas reserves and related assets from vastar including interests in wells  a gas processing plant and two gas gathering systems located in the states of texas  oklahoma and arkansas 
on december  bluebird acquired a ownership interest in the madill gas processing plant and associated gathering system located in marshall and bryan counties  oklahoma 
the effective date of the acquisition was november effective september  the company acquired a net profits interest in the panoma production and gas gathering facilities for million of the company s restricted common stock 
by acquiring this interest  the company lowered its lease operating expense and increased oil field services income 
effective april  the company exchanged interests in certain onshore oil producing properties for interests in certain offshore oil and gas producing properties and production facilities located in the gulf of mexico in a tax free like kind exchange 
the transaction did not have a material effect on reported production in  but the company gained significantly increased exposure in an offshore area of interest where it is conducting exploration activities 
during  we realized proceeds of million from the sale of non core oil and gas and other properties  of which approximately million was attributable to bluebird 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our oil and gas operations and our gas gathering  marketing and processing operations

period to period comparisons for the years ended december  and we reported record net income of million for the year ended december  versus a net loss of million for the same period in total operating revenues increased to a record million and operating profit increased to a record million in a increase in the price received for oil and gas sold on a thousand cubic feet equivalent  or mcfe  basis  combined with a increase in oil and gas production on a million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe  basis in our oil and gas exploration and production segment was primarily responsible for these record results 
we also reported significant increases in revenues and gross operating margins from our gas gathering  marketing and processing and oil field services segments in compared to due to improved product prices and processing economics and an increase in customers for whom we are providing operations services 
income applicable to common shares was million in versus a loss applicable to common shares of million in income per common share basic was per share and income per common share diluted was per share in compared to a loss applicable to common shares of per share  both basic and diluted  in income per share in includes the effect of a million non recurring fee paid upon redemption of million liquidation value of our series a convertible preferred stock 
the fee was treated as a dividend  which reduced income per common share  basic and diluted  by per share and per share  respectively  for the year oil and gas operations for the year  we reported oil production of  mbbls thousand barrels and gas production of  mmcf million cubic feet  which represents a decline of in oil and an increase of in gas produced from our reported equivalent daily rate of production on a million cubic feet per day basis mmcfe day increased to mmcfe day in the reported production in was impacted by the sale of certain non core oil and gas properties which took effect in june and september excluding the production of these properties from both periods  our underlying oil production increased and our underlying gas production increased in compared to  with the underlying equivalent daily rate of production increasing to mmcfe day 
these increases were the result of a full year of production from the properties acquired from vastar being included in as well as the success of our drilling program offsetting normal production declines 
the increase in oil and gas prices was the most significant factor affecting the increase in net income in prices realized in averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
this represents a increase on a thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe basis over average realized prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
the unit prices realized include the effects of hedging 
from time to time  we enter into various hedging contracts in order to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining oil and gas prices 
during  hedging reduced the average price we received for oil by per barrel and for gas by per mcf 
during  we had approximately of our natural gas production and of our oil production hedged 
beginning january  we have approximately of our expected natural gas production hedged for at a weighted average price using cost less collars of to per mcf and we have approximately of our expected crude oil production for the first six months of hedged at a weighted average price using cost less collars of to per barrel 
primarily as a result of higher realized prices  oil and gas revenues increased to million in compared to million in lease operating expenses consist of two components  lifting costs and production tax and other costs 
for  lifting costs  on a unit of production basis  were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in  an increase of 
this increase in lifting costs per unit was due to a general increase in costs of labor  materials and field services stimulated by higher prices for oil and natural gas 
production tax and other costs were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in  an increase of 
this was principally due to an increase of per mcfe in production taxes  which are a function of higher oil and gas prices  and an increase in company overhead charged to oil and gas operations of per mcfe due principally to higher labor and benefit costs 
our gross margin for oil and gas operations oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses for was million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe in  an increase of on a per unit of production basis  primarily as a result of higher oil and gas prices 
gathering  marketing and processing operations for  our gathering system throughput was mmcf per day versus mmcf per day in  a decline of due to the sale of a gathering system in june and to normal production declines behind the system 
gas processing throughput was mmcf per day in versus mmcf per day in  a decrease of 
during december  we completed recoupment of our original investment in the mclean gas processing plant 
as a result  our share of operating income and plant throughput reverted to from the applicable during the recoupment period 
the decline in reported throughput at mclean was partially offset by our acquisition of a interest in the madill gas processing plant in december also  our reported throughput at another plant was reduced beginning june due to the sale of an interest in oil and gas properties supplying the plant 
revenues from gathering  marketing and processing increased to million in versus million in of this increase  million was due to the acquisition of the madill plant 
also  we received significantly higher prices for natural gas and plant products sold in compared to natural gas prices increased while the price received for natural gas liquids increased 
the effect of price increases was seen at the mclean plant  where our revenues declined only despite the decline in our operating interest due to reversion 
operating costs for the gathering  marketing and processing segment increased to million in from million in a substantial portion of this increase was due to the acquisition of the madill plant 
our net share of costs at the mclean plant declined only despite the reversion to a operating interest due to higher natural gas prices affecting the cost of plant throughput 
higher natural gas prices also affected the cost of gas marketed 
the gross margin realized from gathering  marketing and processing for was million versus million in  an increase of 
gathering margin was per mcf in versus in due to an increase in marketing spreads 
processing margin was per mcf in compared to per mcf in due to higher prices for plant products and better processing economics 
oil field services operations revenues from oil field services were million in versus thousand in due to an increase in customers for whom we provided operations services 
operating costs increased to thousand in from thousand in due to higher costs for labor and overhead 
the gross margin for this segment in was thousand versus thousand in  an increase of other income and expenses depreciation and depletion expense was million in versus million in depreciation and depletion on oil and gas properties was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in this increase in the equivalent unit cost was due to an increase in development costs associated with our exploration efforts in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation expense for the gathering  marketing and processing segment increased by thousand in due to the madill plant acquisition 
for  we recorded a gain on sale of thousand versus a gain on sale of thousand in the gain on sale in both periods relates to the sale of property other than oil and gas properties 
since we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties  proceeds from the sale of those properties are applied to the full cost pool and no gain or loss is recognized 
general and administrative expense for increased to million from million in the principal cause of this increase was a million increase in salary  benefits and retirement plan expenses as a result of higher headcount  year end incentive bonuses  and esop expense resulting from appreciation in the company s stock price 
the difference between the stock value on the contribution date and the stock value when purchased must be expensed at the date the contribution is made to the esop 
we recorded equity in earnings of affiliate of million in versus a loss of thousand in this increase was due to increased net earnings from gas marketing operations of the affiliate 
other income was thousand for versus thousand in the increase was caused by an increase in interest income 
interest expense was million for versus million for during most of the interest rate on our libor based bank debt and an interest rate swap were higher than in this was offset by a decrease in outstanding libor based bank debt in the latter part of due to reducing debt from cash raised from the sale of non core oil and gas properties and the exercise of warrants and options for our common stock 
we recorded a total provision for income tax expense of million in versus none in the year provision included a thousand current provision due to alternative minimum tax regulations 
the provision for deferred income tax expense of million in reflects a reduction of million in the valuation allowance charged against our deferred tax asset 
we made this reduction in the valuation allowance in after consideration of current production levels  current expectations regarding near term oil and gas prices  current hedging positions  anticipated capital expenditures  the estimated reversal of book and tax temporary differences  available tax planning strategies and expectations regarding future taxable income 
the valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the factors previously discussed 
no income tax benefit was provided in because of uncertainty at that time in our ability to realize additional tax benefits on our net operating losses in the future 
dividends applicable to preferred stock were million for versus million in the dividends in included the million premium non recurring on redemption of million liquidation value of our series a convertible preferred stock 
for the years ended december  and we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  versus a net loss of million for the same period in total operating revenues increased to million in from million in a increase in the price realized for oil and gas on an mcfe basis combined with a increase in oil and gas production on an mmcfe basis was primarily responsible for the increase in total operating revenues 
we reported an operating profit of million in versus an operating loss of million in in we recognized an impairment of million to our oil and gas properties due to a severe decline in oil and gas prices 
no impairment provision was necessary in we also saw significant improvements in our daily production rates  prices and gross margins for our oil and gas operations as well as improvements in our gas gathering  marketing and processing operations in versus loss applicable to common shares was million in versus million in loss per common share was per share  basic and diluted  in versus per share  basic and diluted in oil and gas operations for the year  we reported oil production of  mbbls thousand barrels and gas production of  mmcf million cubic feet  which represents a increase in oil volume and a increase in gas volume over the reported production in was impacted by the acquisition in december of the spirit properties and in june of the vastar properties 
prices received for oil and gas improved in over the depressed levels experienced in the oil price realized in after the effects of hedging was per barrel versus the hedge adjusted price of in the hedge adjusted price for gas realized in was per mcf versus in this represents a increase on a thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe basis in versus in  hedging reduced the average oil price realized by per barrel and had no effect on the average gas price realized 
on an equivalent unit basis  hedging reduced our sales price by per mcfe in and increased our sale price by per mcfe in as a result of an increase in both production volumes and oil and gas prices realized  oil and gas revenues increased to million in versus million in lifting costs were million in  an increase over on a per unit of production basis  lifting costs decreased to per mcfe due primarily to the acquisition of properties with lower average lifting costs 
production taxes and other costs were million in  a increase over  while on a per unit of production basis  these costs decreased to per mcfe 
for  our gross margin from oil and gas operations increased to million compared to million in  principally due to increases in production and prices 
on a per unit of production basis  the margin increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in gas gathering  marketing and processing operations for  our gathering system throughput was mmcf per day versus mmcf per day in  an decrease due primarily to the sale of a gathering system in gas processing throughput was mmcf per day in versus mmcf per day in  a increase due to the vastar and madill acquisitions 
for  the gross margin we realized from gathering  marketing and processing operations was million  a increase over the gross margin of million 
revenues were million in  an increase over revenues of million due to the madill plant and vastar acquisitions and an improvement in product prices 
operating costs were million in  a increase over costs of million 
the gross margin from gathering was per mcf in  a increase over gas processing gross margins increased to per mcf in over per mcf in due to substantially improved processing economics 
oil field services revenues from oil field services and international sales were thousand in  a decrease from revenues of thousand in  principally due to a decrease in oil field management services provided to third parties 
operating costs were thousand in  a thousand decrease over the gross operating margin from these activities was  in versus  in the period 
other income and expenses depreciation and depletion expense was million in versus million in depreciation and depletion on oil and gas properties was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in  a decrease of 
the improvement in rates was partly due to the impairment write down of million to oil and gas properties in without the benefit of improvements in pricing subsequent to december  we would have incurred an impairment of million 
while this write down is not recoverable if prices increase  it has the effect of lowering our future depletion rates 
we recorded a gain on sale of thousand in versus a loss on sale of thousand in general and administrative expense for decreased to million from million in we recorded equity in loss of affiliate of thousand in versus a loss of thousand in  relating to the operations of our affiliate engaged in natural gas marketing operations 
other income was thousand in versus thousand in due to a decrease in interest income 
interest expense increased to million in from million in due to increased levels of borrowing under our revolving credit lines and an increase in floating interest rates 
we recorded a benefit for deferred income taxes of million in versus no tax benefit in the benefit was recorded in based on the expectation of or utilizing net operating loss carryovers generating this benefit in future years 
no benefit was recorded in due to the uncertainty of utilizing additional loss carryovers due to annual limitations on their use caused by changes in ownership of our common stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million in versus thousand in the increase was due to the issuance of million of series a convertible preferred stock in liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the substantial increase in our operating cash flows in over and over is primarily the result of higher realized oil and gas prices 
our net working capital position at december  was million 
on that date  magnum hunter also had available million under its senior bank credit line  and bluebird had million available under its senior bank credit line 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in we realized proceeds of million from the sale of non core assets during the year  of which approximately million was attributable to bluebird 
both the company and bluebird used these proceeds to repay senior bank indebtedness 
we made cash capital expenditures of million under our capital budget during  of which million was attributable to bluebird 
our capital expenditures are discussed in further detail below 
additionally  we made investments in two unconsolidated affiliates totaling million and advanced funds totaling million under promissory notes receivable 
we received payments on promissory notes receivable totaling million during the year in  net cash used in investing activities was million  which included proceeds from asset sales of million and capital expenditures of million 
in we used million in investing activities  including million for capital expenditures and million for other assets

bluebird had a net increase in cash of million 
bluebird s capital resources 
internally generated cash flow and the borrowing capacity under its senior bank credit line are bluebird s major sources of liquidity 
from time to time  bluebird may also sell properties in order to increase liquidity 
during  bluebird realized proceeds of million from property sales 
on may   bluebird s commercial banks agreed to allow it to acquire of magnum hunter s series a convertible preferred stock at liquidation value  or million  and to purchase up to thousand of magnum hunter s common stock 
on december  the convertible preferred and the common stock were sold to magnum hunter production  inc for cash proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to pay down bluebird s senior credit line 
at december  bluebird s senior credit line borrowing base was set at million and borrowings under the senior credit line were million  leaving availability of million at that date 
on february  the borrowing base was reduced to million 
we believe that this bank credit line  along with cash flow from operations  provides bluebird with sufficient liquidity to meet interest payments as well as carry out its capital spending budget plans through magnum hunter s capital resources 
the following discussion of magnum hunter s capital resources refers to the company and its affiliates other than bluebird  whose capital resources were discussed separately above 
internally generated cash flow and the borrowing capacity under its senior bank credit line are the company s major source of liquidity 
from time to time  the company may also sell properties in order to increase liquidity 
during  the company realized proceeds of million from property sales 
in addition  the company may use other sources of capital  including the issuance of additional debt securities or equity securities  as sources to fund acquisitions or other specific needs 
in the past  the company has accessed both public and private capital markets to provide liquidity for specific activities and general corporate purposes 
during the year  the company realized million in net proceeds from the issuance of its common stock  including million from the exercise of both its publically traded and privately held warrants and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
in december the company used million to purchase all of its series a convertible preferred stock outstanding from bluebird 
this preferred stock was held by an affiliate for possible re issue at a later date 
also in december the company spent million including a million redemption premium to redeem of its outstanding series a convertible preferred stock 
in january  the remaining of this preferred stock was converted to the company s common stock by the holder at the conversion price of per share 
as a result of these preferred stock transactions  the company no longer has any dividend paying preferred stock outstanding  which will result in annual savings of approximately million in dividends paid 
the company s borrowing base under its senior bank credit line was million at december  and its borrowings under this line were million on that date  leaving availability of million on that date 
on a semiannual basis  the borrowing base is redetermined by the banks based on their review of the company s oil and gas reserves 
if the outstanding senior bank debt exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  the company must repay the excess 
the company s internally generated cash flow  results of operations  and financing for its operations are dependent on oil and gas prices 
as a result of substantial increases in oil and gas prices in versus  our earnings and cash flows in have been materially increased compared to to the extent that oil and gas prices decline  the company s earnings and cash flows may be adversely affected 
however  the company believes that its cash flow from operations  existing working capital and availability under its senior bank credit line will be sufficient to meet interest payments and to fund the capital expenditure budget for the year capital expenditures 
during  the company s total capital expenditures were million 
of the total  million was for property acquisition costs  of which million paid in restricted common stock was spent to acquire a net profits interest in certain properties 
exploration activities accounted for million  development activities accounted for million  and additions to other assets accounted for thousand of the capital expenditures 
as of december  the company had total unproved oil and gas property costs of million  consisting of property acquisition costs of million and exploratory costs of million 
for the year  the company has budgeted approximately million for exploration and development activities 
the company is not contractually obligated to proceed with any of its budgeted capital expenditures 
the amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors that are not entirely within the company s control or ability to forecast  including drilling results and changes in oil and gas prices 
as a result  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from current expectations 
in the normal course of business  the company reviews opportunities for the possible acquisition of oil and gas reserves and activities related thereto 
when potential acquisition opportunities are deemed consistent with the company s growth strategy  bids or offers in amounts and with terms acceptable to the company may be submitted 
it is uncertain whether any such bids or offers which may be submitted by the company from time to time will be acceptable to the sellers 
in the event of a future significant acquisition  the company may require additional financing in connection therewith

all forward looking statements attributable to magnum hunter resources  inc are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
inflation and changes in prices during  the company experienced substantial increase in prices for oil and gas compared to the previous year 
the results of operations and cash flow of the company have been  and will continue to be  affected by the volatility in oil and gas prices 
should the company experience a significant increase in oil and gas prices that is sustained over a prolonged period  it would expect that there would also be a corresponding increase in oil and gas finding costs  lease acquisition costs  and operating expenses 
periodically the company enters into futures  options  and swap contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil and gas prices 
it is the policy of the company not to enter into any such arrangements which exceed of the company s oil and gas production during the next months 
the company markets oil and gas for its own account  which exposes the company to the attendant commodities risk 
a significant portion of the company s gas production is currently sold to ngts  llc or end users either on the spot market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or under long term contracts based on current spot market prices 
the company normally sells its oil under month to month contracts to a variety of purchasers 
new accounting standard statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as extended by sfas no 
june and amended by sfas no 
june  is effective for the company beginning january  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
all derivatives within the company have been identified pursuant to sfas no 
requirements  and the company has designated  documented  and assessed hedging relationships 
the company was obligated to four crude oil derivatives  one natural gas derivative  and one interest rate derivative on january  the company has determined that the interest rate derivative will not qualify for treatment as a fair value hedge as defined in the statement 
as a result  the derivative asset or liability related to the interest rate derivative must be recorded at fair value on the company s balance sheet with an effect to income 
the crude oil and natural gas derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges  which require the company to record the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on its balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income 
future hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedges will be recorded in earnings 
adoption of this accounting standard as of january  resulted in the recognition of thousand of derivative assets and million of derivative liabilities with a cumulative effect increase to income of thousand after tax and with a cumulative effect decrease to other comprehensive income of approximately million after tax for the transition adjustment as of january item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
energy swap agreements 
the company produces  purchases  and sells crude oil  natural gas  condensate  and natural gas liquids 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
the company has previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intends to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which it considers favorable 
the company engages in futures contracts with certain of its production through various contracts swap agreements 
the primary objective of these activities is to protect against decreases in price during the term of the hedge 
the swap agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the new york mercantile exchange nymex light sweet oil and the inside ferc natural gas index price posting index 
the company has contracts which contain specific contracted prices swaps that are settled monthly based on the differences between the contract prices and the specified index prices for each month applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the index exceeds the contract price  the company pays the spread  and to the extent the contract price exceeds the index price the company receives the spread 
in addition  the company has combined contracts which have agreed upon price floors and ceilings costless collars 
to the extent the index price exceeds the contract ceiling  the company pays the spread between the ceiling and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the contract floor exceeds the index  the company receives the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the company receives the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to related contract volumes  the company has a credit risk in the event of nonperformance of the counterparty to the agreement 
the company does not anticipate any material impact to its results of operations as a result of nonperformance by such parties

if future market prices were to decline from those in effect at december   the fair value of the open contracts to the company would be a liability of million 
the company currently intends to commit no more than of its production on a bcfe basis to such arrangements at any point in time 
a portion of the company s oil and natural gas production will be subject to price fluctuations unless the company enters into additional hedging transactions 
interest rate swaps on june   the company entered into two interest rate swaps in order to shift a portion of the fixed rate bond debt to floating rate debt  to capitalize on what was perceived as a market overreaction to pending interest rate increases by the federal reserve and to effectively lower interest rate expense over the following twelve months 
on june  one of the interest rate swaps terminated
