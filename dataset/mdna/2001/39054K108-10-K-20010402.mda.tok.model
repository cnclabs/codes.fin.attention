the provision for income taxes in represents state income taxes estimated to be payable 
liquidity and capital resources on january   the company entered into an agreement with coast business credit to provide the company with a million revolving credit facility  collateralized by accounts receivable 
the maximum borrowings available to the company is based upon the amount of receivables available to collateralize the amount being borrowed 
at closing  million of proceeds was used to pay a short term note due to raytheon 
at december   the amount available under the line of credit agreement was  all of which had been borrowed 
raytheon is the company s primary aircraft supplier and largest creditor 
the company has financed all but one of its beechcraft aircraft and one of its brasilia aircraft under related lease and debt agreements with raytheon 
raytheon had also provided a million working capital line of credit payable on demand and expiring on june  and a million short term loan  due on june   and collateralized by beechcraft spare parts and equipment and accounts receivable 
the company paid raytheon million on january  upon closing of the agreement with coast business credit coast 
additionally  the company converted the remainder of the raytheon working capital line of credit to a three year term note on december  the agreement with coast contains a covenant which requires the company to maintain a specific balance of tangible net worth  as defined 
at december   the company was not in compliance with that covenant 
under the coast agreement  such noncompliance permits coast  at its option  to require immediate prepayment of all amounts owed by great lakes to coast million at december  
such action would further exacerbate the corporate liquidity issues described below 
coast has not  to date  taken any action as a result of the default although the interest rate on the coast loan now has been increased by annually as a result of not meeting a lesser net tangible assets requirement 
this default could result in default on other agreements or contracts 
such default and recent losses could also have an adverse effect on the company s relationship with current and potential code sharing partners 
the company incurred a substantial loss during the fourth quarter which was partially caused by major fare reductions by united which in turn affected the fares received by the company  in addition to winter weather related expenses and flight cancellations 
the company believes that its new code sharing agreement will provide more flexibility to set fares and potentially increase revenues 
because of the recent nature of these losses  the company currently has no financing agreements in place under which it can secure additional funds 
the company is currently exploring alternatives to meet its future liquidity requirements and is making payment to significant creditors as current cash flow allows 
the company is in current contact with certain of these creditors regarding its slowness in payments 
to date  no formal action has been taken by the company s creditors 
however  no assurance can be given that the company s creditors may not take such action 
historically  the operations have been highly seasonal with the second and third quarters of the calendar year producing significantly more cash flow than the first and fourth quarters 
the company believes the fair value of a number of its aircraft is higher than the current amount of financing on such aircraft 
as a result  during the first two months of passenger revenues declined by approximately percent as compared to the first two months of this was partially the result of a discontinuation of unprofitable service at rhinelander  wisconsin on january and burlington  iowa  lafayatte  indiana  and mattoon  illinois on february in february of  the company cancelled of its scheduled operations primarily due to severe winter weather in the upper midwest and five days of lower than required landing visibility due to fog conditions at its denver hub 
the company estimates that these disruptions resulted in passenger revenue losses in excess of million 
as a result  the company expects to incur a significant loss in the first quarter of in february and march of  the company did not make scheduled debt and lease payments to raytheon of approximately million 
in addition  the company did not make scheduled lease payments of  to two lessors on four aircraft 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and all hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at their fair values 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its designation and effectiveness 
for derivatives that qualify as effective hedges  the change in fair value will have no impact on earnings until the hedged item affects earnings 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments  or for the ineffective portion of a hedging instrument  the change in fair value will affect current period earnings 
at december   the company had no derivative instruments 
the company adopted this statement on january  there has been no impact as a result of the adoption 
in  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab summarizes the sec staff s views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company has reviewed its revenue recognition policies and has determined that they comply with the principles as set forth in sab no 
accordingly  the adoption of the sab will have no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
frequent flyer program the company s passengers carried as a part of a code sharing flight with united  and effective may   carried under the company s own name may earn miles in united s mileage plus frequent flyer program 
passengers may use mileage accumulated in this program to obtain discounted or free tickets for trips that might include a flight segment on one of the company s flights 
no revenues are earned or collected on free tickets awarded to passengers under the program 
awards earned under the frequent flyers program have an expiration date three years from the date earned however  the three year period is renewed each time the participant earns or redeems mileage 
the program also contains certain restrictions  including blackout dates and capacity controlled bookings  which substantially limit the use of awards on certain flights and during the busiest periods 
the company continually monitors the number of free travel award reservations on its flight segments to ensure that they are within the capacity restrictions defined in the mileage plus program 
the company s yield management program and related seat restrictions minimize the number of revenue passengers that may be displaced on any individual flight segment 
to date  the company has not experienced any material use of mileage plus awards to obtain travel on flights  and the incremental cost to the company attributable to the exercise of frequent flyer awards consisting primarily of a minimal amount of additional gate and passenger service expenses has not been material 
awards used on the company s flights during the year ended december  represented approximately percent of the company s total passengers 
the company expects that this percentage will remain approximately the same for the foreseeable future 
based on this low percentage  the availability on many of the company s flights of otherwise vacant seats  and on the program s restrictions  the company believes that the displacement  if any  of revenue passengers by users of mileage plus and awards will not become material 
the company continually monitors the number of awards redeemed and will accrue the incremental costs associated with the mileage plus and program if they become material 
effects of inflation except for the price of fuel  inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations in the past five years 
the company is subject to inflationary pressures from labor agreements  fuel price escalations and costs at airports served which it attempts to recover through fare and schedule adjustments 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of cautionary factors the company wishes to caution shareholders and prospective investors that the following important factors  among others identified in this annual report on form k  could affect the company s actual operating results  and that such results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose 
the order in which such factors appear below should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 
dependence on relationship with united the company generated of its passenger revenues for the year ended december  under the united express agreements described under business united express and code sharing relationship 
as a result of the relationship with united  the company s business is sensitive to events and risks affecting united 
if adverse events affect united s business as was the case in the last two quarters of  the company s business is also adversely affected 
the impact of this relationship is shown below in the graph day advanced bookings which displays total passenger reservations for future flights by week 
the summer united labor disruptions and schedule reductions resulted in a significant reduction in passenger reservations on great lakes during this high travel period 
major temporary fare reductions by united to regain market share diluted fourth quarter yields 
also displayed is the slowing of reservation sales at the end of and early as capacity is reduced to match anticipated traffic levels 
edgar representation of data points used in printed graphic date advanced bookings on february   the company and united entered into a new three year code sharing agreement which becomes effective may  under the new agreement  great lakes  operating under its own name may enter into code sharing agreements with certain other carriers 
to the extent that the company is successful in participating in code sharing agreements with other carriers  it will reduce its dependence on united and may mitigate the effects of such adverse events if they relate to united only 
effect of general economic conditions the airline industry is significantly affected by general economic conditions 
during recent recessions  most airlines reduced fares in an effort to increase traffic 
economic and competitive conditions in the airline industry have contributed to a number of bankruptcies and liquidations among airlines 
a worsening of current economic conditions  or an extended period of recession nationally or regionally  would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
fuel costs fuel is a major component of operating expense for all airlines 
the company s cost of fuel varies directly with market conditions  and the company has no guaranteed long term sources of supply 
the company intends generally to follow industry trends by raising fares in response to significant fuel price increases 
however  the company s ability to pass on increased fuel costs through fare increases may be limited by economic and competitive conditions 
accordingly  a reduction in the availability or an increase in the price of fuel could have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flow from operations and profitability 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced lower passenger volumes during the months of january through april and in november and december 
this seasonality can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating conditions in the company s principal area of operations  resulting in fewer vacations and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these months 
these seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues  increased operating losses and reduced cash flow for the company during these months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial statements the risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
the company is susceptible to certain risks related to changes in the cost of aircraft fuel and changes in interest rates 
at december   the company does not have any derivative financial instruments 
aircraft fuel airline operators are dependent upon fuel to operate and therefore  are impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices 
great lakes earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel represented approximately of great lakes operating expenses in a one cent change in the average cost of aircraft fuel would impact the company s aircraft fuel expense by approximately  annually  based upon fuel consumption in interest rates the company s operations are very capital intensive  as the vast majority of assets are flight equipment  which are long lived 
great lakes exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to its debt obligations 
the company does have exposure to changes in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates as a significant portion of its long term debt has variable interest rates 
additionally  the company is exposed to changes in fair values of its debt obligations which carry fixed rates of interest 
as disclosed in note to the financial statements  the company has total long term debt outstanding of million at december  assuming no change in variable rates at december  the interest expense on long term obligations due in the five subsequent years and thereafter were as follows fixed average variable average rate fixed rate variable thereafter
