item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary radio frequency  microwave frequency and millimeter wave frequency integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors for the wireless and broadband communications markets 
during our second quarter ended october   we reorganized into two reportable segments based on management s methods of evaluating operations and performance 
our reportable segments are semiconductor products and ceramic products 
the semiconductor products segment is comprised of two of the company s former segments wireless semiconductor products and application specific products 
a description of the reportable segments follows the semiconductor products segment designs and manufactures gallium arsenide integrated circuits  other discrete semiconductors and multi chip modules primarily for the global wireless communications and broadband markets 
this segment represented of our total sales in fiscal the ceramic products segment designs and manufactures technical ceramic and magnetic products primarily for the global wireless infrastructure and broadband markets 
this segment represented of our total sales in fiscal on april   we completed our acquisition of privately held network device  inc ndi of sunnyvale  california 
approximately million shares of common stock of the company were exchanged for all outstanding shares of ndi 
approximately  shares of company stock were reserved for the conversion of ndi stock options into company options 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of ndi 
our customers include leading oems in the wireless and broadband communications industry and their principal suppliers 
during fiscal  sales to our largest customers accounted for of our total sales 
during that period  sales to motorola and ericsson accounted for and  respectively  of total sales 
results of operations the following table shows our statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated years ended april  april  march  sales cost of sales gross margin research and development expenses selling and administrative expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries fiscal years ended april   april  and march  sales 
sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is principally the result of high growth experienced by our semiconductor and ceramic products segments during the first nine months of fiscal as demand for wireless and broadband products increased during this period 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a downturn in the wireless and broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly sales  reducing the overall increase in sales during fiscal when compared to fiscal sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased demand for wireless products  as well as demand for products in emerging broadband data applications 
sales of products for the defense market decreased to of total sales in fiscal from in fiscal and in  as we continue to exit the defense market by offering last time buys to our customers and concluding existing contracts 
deliveries to motorola represented of our total sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal deliveries to ericsson represented of our total sales in fiscal and represented less than of our total sales in fiscal and fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases were primarily attributable to our continued ability to leverage capacity and improve operating efficiencies in both our semiconductor and ceramic products segments during the first nine months of fiscal  offset by the effect of high fixed costs on lower sales experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily a result of increased sales  as well as improved operating efficiencies in our semiconductor and ceramic products segments  as both continued to leverage capacity and improve yields 
gross margin decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the slight decrease in gross margin was attributable to our acquisition of ndi on april  ndi experienced a negative gross margin during fiscal as it initiated a ramp in production during this period without the offsetting sales volume 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million or of sales in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to our ongoing development of processes and applications within our semiconductor products segment in order to address our targeted markets wireless and broadband 
more than of our total research and development spending in fiscal was within the semiconductor products segment 
research and development expenses increased to million or of sales in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the development of processes and applications in the semiconductor products segment 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million or of sales in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal included in the million is approximately million in one time transaction costs associated with the acquisition of ndi on april  excluding these one time costs  selling and administrative expenses for fiscal would have totaled million or of sales  an increase of compared to fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased direct selling costs resulting from higher sales volumes  as well as increased costs related to training and recruiting employees 
due to our continued ability to support our sales growth without incurring substantial additional costs  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal when compared to fiscal alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries selling and administrative expenses increased to million or of sales in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to increased sales commissions and direct selling costs resulting from higher sales volumes  as well as increased expenses related to training  recruiting and an increased sales force 
as a result of our ability to support our sales growth without incurring substantial additional costs  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal over fiscal other income  net 
other income  net  increased to million or of sales in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal the increase in other income  net  was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income as a result of higher average levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income  net  more than quadrupled to million or of sales in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal the increase was also primarily the result of considerably higher levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the fiscal provision reflects a tax rate of approximately compared to a tax rate of in fiscal the decrease in the fiscal tax rate is primarily the result of research and development tax credits utilized in fiscal the million benefit reflected in fiscal reflects a tax rate offset by a million tax benefit 
the tax benefit of million resulted from a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets because of the expected use of net operating loss carryforwards in future periods 
business segments the table below displays sales and operating income by business segment for fiscal  and see note to the consolidated financial statements

sales for the semiconductor products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased demand and penetration into our two targeted markets  wireless communications and broadband during the first nine months of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a downturn in the wireless and broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly sales  reducing the overall increase in sales during fiscal sales for the semiconductor products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase reflects a growing wireless market to include data  increased market penetration and gains in market share 
operating income for the semiconductor products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal included in the million is approximately million in one time transaction costs associated with the acquisition of ndi 
excluding these one time costs  operating income alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries for fiscal would have totaled million  an increase of when compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and improved operating efficiencies as this segment continued to leverage capacity  improve yields and control selling and administrative costs 
operating income for the semiconductor products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and improved operating efficiencies as this segment continued to leverage capacity and control material costs 
additionally  as this segment continued its development of processes and applications for the wireless and broadband markets  it was able to control administrative costs 
ceramic products 
sales for the ceramic products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to growth in demand and increased penetration in the wireless infrastructure and broadband markets for the first nine months of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a downturn in the wireless and broadband markets resulted in lower quarterly sales  reducing the overall increase in sales during fiscal sales for the ceramic products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales was primarily attributable to growth in wireless infrastructure combined with added customer penetration  as well as an increasing demand from emerging broadband customers 
operating income for the ceramic products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales and improved operating efficiencies  including the leveraging of existing capacity and the investment in more cost effective equipment 
operating income for the ceramic products segment more than doubled to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and improved operating efficiencies  including the leveraging of capacity and increased manufacturing automation 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   we had working capital of million  including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in fiscal  operations generated million of cash primarily attributable to net income of million 
in addition  we effectively managed working capital as evidenced by an increase in average annual inventory turns to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and by a decrease in average annual days sales outstanding to days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal totaled million 
of the million  approximately million was related to the semiconductor products segment as we continued our investment in the semiconductor gaas wafer fabrication operation and the integrated circuit and discrete semiconductor assembly and test areas 
of the million  million relates to the purchase of a  square foot facility in haverhill  massachusetts 
this facility was purchased in september and provides additional manufacturing and office space 
initial operations at this site commenced in january and include design engineering as well as gaas ic  silicon semiconductor and multi chip module assembly and testing 
the relocation of these operations to the haverhill facility has provided additional space for the expansion of fabrication operations at our facility in woburn  massachusetts 
in september  we announced the completion of the first phase of a major expansion program to enhance and expand the available clean room space in our gaas ic facility in woburn  massachusetts 
the new clean room space is complete and in use  and additional manufacturing equipment has been installed and brought to full operation 
the second phase  which involved the installation of additional production equipment within the existing facility  has been completed 
the third phase of the expansion program involves the creation of a gaas ic line that will allow the manufacture of product on six inch wafers 
we are in the initial stages of development of this six inch wafer production line  which we estimate will cost approximately million dollars 
we expect to complete this phase within twelve to fifteen months 
once alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries this new six inch wafer production line is in operation  we plan to convert our existing four inch wafer production areas to six inch  as future demand requires 
improvements in manufacturing capabilities at our ceramics facilities accounted for approximately million of capital expenditures 
in november  we extended our million revolving credit agreement through november  the revolving credit agreement had an initial expiration date of october  there were no borrowings under this agreement at april  we expect to continue to maintain a debt facility upon expiration of the existing credit agreement 
in june  we completed a public offering of our common stock that raised net proceeds of million 
substantially all of the proceeds were invested in commercial paper and securities issued by various federal agencies and corporations 
the net proceeds may be used for the purchase of equipment  the expansion of facilities and the acquisition of businesses  technologies or products that complement our business 
on april   we announced the completion of our acquisition of privately held network device  inc based in sunnyvale  california 
approximately million shares of common stock of the company were exchanged for all outstanding shares of ndi 
approximately  shares of company stock were reserved for the conversion of ndi stock options into company options 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we believe that anticipated cash from operations  available funds and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  together with the net proceeds from our fiscal stock offering  will be adequate to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through fiscal other matters inflation did not have a significant impact upon our results of operations during the three year period ended april  on april   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging instruments and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment to sfas no 
the adoption of these statements had no material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
forward looking statements this report and other documents we have filed with the securities and exchange commission contain forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements represent our judgment regarding future events 
although we would not make forward looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so  we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties 
we urge you to consider the risks and uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in the other documents filed with the sec in evaluating our forward looking statements 
we have no plans to update our forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
we generally identify forward looking statements with the words plans  expects  anticipates  estimates  will  should and similar expressions 
alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries current market conditions make it especially difficult to predict operating results 
our operating results have been materially and adversely affected in the past by the failure of anticipated orders to be realized and by deferrals and cancellations of orders as a result of changes in customer requirements 
current market conditions make predictions of future operations particularly difficult 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following significant variations in and unpredictability of customer orders  more frequent customer requests for order cancellations and deferrals customers inability to make accurate forecasts or predictions of their future requirements  and customers increased efforts to minimize their inventories and attain just in time delivery 
our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our sales in each fiscal period has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
if we lost one or more of these major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly decreases its orders  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
in fiscal  sales to our five largest customers accounted for of our sales  with motorola and ericsson accounting for and of sales  respectively 
our future operating results depend on the success of these customers and our success in selling products to them 
our sales volume is affected by our oem customers sales volume 
a substantial portion of our sales is derived from sales of products to oems 
these oems demand highly reliable products and often require up to several months to evaluate and test our integrated circuits and devices before deciding to design them into their products 
if our products are designed into an oem s product  our sales volume will depend upon the commercial success and the length and timing of the product cycle of the oem s product 
we are also subject to sales variations arising from our oem customers inventory management 
our operating results have been materially affected and will probably be affected in the future by unexpected changes in our oem customers order patterns 
difficulties in production would adversely affect our operating results 
our products are very complex  have sophisticated designs and are manufactured using complex process technologies 
difficulties in production can occur which would limit our ability to ship product and adversely affect our operating results 
in most cases  our products are customized for our customers who insist that our products meet their exact specifications for quality  performance and reliability 
if we are unable to manufacture to our customers specifications  our operating results will suffer 
our operating results are dependent on the development of new products and on our ability to increase product revenue per platform 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products in a timely and cost effective manner and on our continued ability to increase product revenue per platform 
the development of our new products is highly complex 
we have sometimes experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
the successful development and introduction of new products depends on a number of factors  including our timely completion of product designs and development  our ability to develop manufacturing processes for new products  and commercial acceptance of our new products and enhancements 
our failure to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the wireless and broadband communications industry would impair our growth 
the wireless and broadband communications markets are characterized by frequent introductions of new products  services and protocols 
new products  services and protocols respond to evolving product and process technologies and consumer demand for greater functionality  lower costs  smaller products and better performance 
as a result  we have experienced  and will continue to experience  product design obsolescence 
we must continue to improve our product designs and develop new products with new technologies to meet our customers demands 
we operate in very competitive industries and we may be unable to compete successfully 
competition in the markets for our products is intense 
we compete with several companies primarily alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling integrated circuits  discrete semiconductors and ceramic products  as well as suppliers of other discrete products 
for example  we compete with our largest customer in the production of power amplifiers 
our competitors could develop new process technologies that may be superior to ours 
in addition  many of our existing and potential customers manufacture or assemble wireless communications devices and have substantial in house technological capabilities 
if one of our large customers decided to design and manufacture integrated circuits internally  it could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
many of our existing and potential competitors have strong market positions  considerable internal manufacturing capacity  established intellectual property rights and substantial technological capabilities 
moreover  a number of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors 
we expect competition to increase 
this could mean lower prices for our products or reduced demand for our products 
any of these developments would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
average selling prices for our products typically decline over time 
average selling prices for our products decline over time 
many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
for a given level of sales  when our manufacturing costs decline  our gross margins improve  and when our manufacturing costs increase  our gross margins decline 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we may experience these problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
our operating results would suffer if one of our key suppliers fails to deliver materials or services for the fabrication of our products 
we obtain certain materials and services for our products from one or a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we procure gaas substrates  a critical raw material  from a small number of suppliers 
in addition  we obtain some gaas wafers from a single external foundry  and we buy silicon substrates for semiconductors and certain chemical powders for ceramic manufacturing from single sources 
we purchase these materials and services on a purchase order basis 
we do not carry significant inventories and have long term supply contracts with only a limited number of our vendors 
our inability to obtain critical materials or services in required quantities or in acceptable quality would result in significant delays or reductions in product shipments 
this would materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly and annual sales  earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future primarily as a result of variations in our customers orders and the potential for delay or deferral of customer implementation of our technology into their products 
the benefits of our gaas products compared to silicon alternatives may not continue 
the production of gaas integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits 
as a result  we must offer gaas products that provide superior performance to that of silicon for specific applications to be competitive with silicon products 
if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to offset the cost differential  our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
we believe our costs of producing gaas integrated circuits will continue to exceed the costs associated with the production of silicon circuits 
the costs differ because of higher costs of raw materials for gaas  lower production yields in gaas technology and higher unit costs associated with lower production volumes 
silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance superior to that offered by silicon solutions 
we face significant challenges managing our growth 
we have experienced periods of significant growth  and expect to do so in the future 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries improve operational systems  maintain adequate physical plant  manufacturing facilities and equipment to meet customer demand  add experienced senior level managers  and attract and retain qualified people with experience in engineering  design and manufacturing 
we will spend substantial amounts of money in connection with our growth and may have additional unexpected costs 
our manufacturing equipment may not be adequate to support rapid increases in orders for our products  and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
if we cannot attract qualified people or manage growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
there may be unanticipated costs associated with increasing our capacity 
we anticipate that any future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity 
in response to this need  we have begun the implementation of a conversion of our woburn  massachusetts gaas ic fabrication facility that will allow the manufacture of product on six inch wafers 
we also purchased a  square foot facility in haverhill  massachusetts  which provides additional manufacturing and office space for our massachusetts operations 
we may be required to purchase significant additional equipment or further expand our facilities in the future 
expansion activities such as these are subject to a number of risks  including unavailability or late delivery of the advanced  and often customized  equipment used in the production of our products  delays in bringing new production equipment on line  work stoppages and delays in supplying products for our existing customers during expansion activities  and unforeseen environmental or engineering problems relating to existing or new facilities 
these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of our present expansion or any future expansion of our capacity 
our international sales could decline as a result of currency exchange fluctuations and other factors 
our sales outside of the united states were approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal because most of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars  our products  particularly our ceramic products  become less price competitive with products manufactured by competitors based in countries whose currencies decline in value against the dollar 
international sales involve a number of additional risks  including imposition of government controls  potential insolvency of international distributors and representatives  fluctuation of economies outside the united states  political instability outside the united states  generally longer receivables collection periods for foreign customers  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  due to the technological advantage provided by gaas in many military applications  a portion of our sales outside of north america are subject to export controls 
although we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining necessary export licenses  failure to obtain such licenses in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our compliance with environmental regulations may be costly 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local requirements governing the protection of the environment 
these requirements relate to the use  storage  handling  discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes 
we may incur significant expense in complying with these requirements  and these requirements may become more stringent in the future 
in the past  compliance with environmental alpha industries  inc 
and subsidiaries regulations and our response to environmental claims and litigation has been costly 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to substantial liability or force us to change our manufacturing operations 
in addition  under some of these regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
we may have difficulty in protecting our intellectual property 
our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property 
a significant aspect of our intellectual property is our product and process technology 
we rely primarily on trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our trade secrets and intellectual property 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our trade secrets or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this may make the possibility of misappropriation of our technology and trade secrets more likely 
we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our trade secrets and intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our operations could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
aspects of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which we may be required to seek licenses 
we cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek will be reasonable 
we may have difficulty in managing and integrating acquisitions 
from time to time  we explore opportunities to acquire businesses to expand our production capacity and our product offerings  such as our acquisition of ndi 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating operations  products and corporate cultures  difficulties in completing the development of acquired technologies  difficulties in managing different geographic units  entering markets or businesses in which we have limited experience  and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
moreover  any delay or failure to integrate an acquired company  technology or product line could result in the additional expenditure of money and in increased demands on our management s time 
these expenditures and demands could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions may involve expending significant funds and the issuance of additional securities  which may be dilutive to stockholders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of short term investments and financial instruments caused by fluctuations in investment prices and interest rates 
investment price risk the fair value of the company s short term investment portfolio at april   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk  estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio  is not considered to be material because of the short term nature of the investments 
interest rate risk the carrying value of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  was  at april  due to the nature of the debt instruments  management has determined that the fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value
