part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company is one of the world s leading integrated producers of titanium sponge  melted and mill products 
the company is the only integrated producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
the company estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of mill products and approximately of worldwide sponge production 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were approximately of industry mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with such diverse uses as offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor  automotive and architectural applications 
timet s products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  melted products comprised of titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
the company believes it is among the lower cost producers of titanium sponge and melted products due in part to its manufacturing expertise and technology 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers which  like the company  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
the company is presently the only active titanium sponge producer in the us the company s long term strategy is to maximize the value of its core aerospace business and  at the same time  develop new markets  applications and products to help reduce its traditional dependence on the aerospace industry 
the company s focus in the short term is to return to profitability and generate positive cash flow 
to accomplish its short term goals  the company is attempting to reduce costs  improve quality and streamline its overall business and manufacturing processes as well as maximize its participation in the increasing demand for aerospace quality titanium during this business cycle 
industry 
the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in  and during the to period  the company reported aggregate net income of million which more than offset the aggregate net losses of million it reported during the difficult to period 
the company also reported net losses in and aggregating million 
the company currently expects to report a net loss in  however  it expects that its loss in will be substantially reduced from levels as a result of the recent upturn in its business cycle 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
demand for titanium reached a peak in when worldwide industry mill product shipments reached an estimated  metric tons 
industry mill product shipments subsequently declined approximately to an estimated  metric tons in  with a further decline to an estimated  metric tons in and the company expects that worldwide industry mill product shipments will increase in by approximately to about  metric tons 
the expected increase is primarily attributable to stronger demand resulting from an increase in forecasted aircraft build rates  as well as a substantial decrease in the amount of excess titanium inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain 
the present business environment is substantially different from that in to during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached  and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
this resulted in considerable excess inventory throughout the supply chain 
during  aerospace customers continued to focus on reducing inventories and a significant number of the company s aerospace customers canceled or delayed previously scheduled orders 
the aerospace supply chain is fragmented and decentralized making it difficult to quantify excess inventories 
however  customer actions such as order delays ie pushouts and cancellations  combined with other data provide limited visibility 
during  the company experienced no significant customer pushouts or cancellations of deliveries 
late in and early  the company experienced an increase in orders for aerospace quality titanium products and certain customers requested advanced delivery of existing orders and its order backlog increased substantially 
although quantitative information is not readily available  these factors and others lead the company to believe that the excess titanium inventory throughout the supply chain has been substantially reduced and is unlikely to be a significant factor in in most areas 
mill product shipments to the aerospace industry in represented about of total industry demand and about of the company s annual mill product shipments 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components ie blades  discs  rings and engine cases and air frame components ie bulkheads  tail sections  landing gears  wing supports and fasteners can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
industry shipments of mill products to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of aerospace demand and of aggregate titanium mill product demand 
the company believes that demand for mill products for the commercial aerospace sector will be the principal driver of the expected increase in industry mill product shipments during demand growth for these markets and sectors is expected to exceed the aggregate growth in titanium mill product shipments while other markets are expected to experience lesser growth 
shipments to the commercial aerospace sector represented approximately of the company s sales volume in accordingly  the company believes its sales volume in may increase more than the expected increase in titanium industry mill product shipments 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the commercial airline industry reported operating income of approximately billion estimated in  compared to billion in and billion in according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft including wide body aircraft 
wide body aircraft use substantially more titanium than narrow body aircraft 
commercial aircraft deliveries are currently expected to be including wide bodies in and including wide bodies in the demand for titanium generally precedes aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
accordingly  the company s cycle historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
the company can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will affect demand for the company s products 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has expanded 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants  and pollution control equipment 
titanium is also experiencing increased customer demand in several emerging markets with diverse uses such as offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor  and automotive and architectural applications 
while shipments to emerging markets represented less than of the company s sales volume in  the company believes these emerging applications represent potential growth opportunities 
if titanium usage in these markets continues to develop  they may  over time  reduce the industry s and the company s dependence on the aerospace industry 
for example  titanium manufactured by the company is being used to produce the exhaust system for the model of the chevrolet corvette z  the first significant titanium component selected for a production automobile 
volkswagen is using titanium supplied by the company in the suspension springs on the model year lupo fsi automobile 
in a separate market  the company delivered titanium production casing during for one of the largest geothermal wells in the world 
customer agreements 
the company has long term agreements lta s with certain major aerospace customers  including the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc  united technologies corporation and related companies and wyman gordon company a unit of precision castparts corporation 
these agreements  which became effective in and  generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements generally at least for extended periods nine to ten years and ii fixed or formula determined prices generally for at least the first five years 
the lta s were structured to provide incentives to both parties to lower timet s costs and share in the savings 
these contracts and others represent the core of the company s long term aerospace strategy 
these agreements were designed to limit pricing volatility both up and down for the long term benefit of both parties  while providing timet with a solid base of aerospace volume 
the lta with boeing requires boeing to purchase a minimum percentage of its and its suppliers titanium requirements from timet commencing in although boeing placed orders and accepted delivery of certain volumes in and  the level of orders placed by boeing in and was significantly below the contractual volume requirements for those years 
boeing informed the company in that it was unwilling to commit to the contract beyond the year the company presently expects to receive less than the minimum contractual order volume from boeing in in march  the company filed a lawsuit against boeing in a colorado state court seeking damages for boeing s repudiation and breach of the boeing contract 
timet s complaint seeks damages from boeing that timet believes could be in excess of million and a declaration from the court of timet s rights under the contract 
in june  boeing filed its answer to timet s complaint denying substantially all of timet s allegations and making certain counterclaims against timet 
timet believes such counterclaims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against such claims 
the litigation is in the discovery phase  with a trial date currently set for january the company continues to have discussions with boeing about possible settlement of the matter 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve a favorable outcome to this litigation 
as a complement to the lta s entered into with the company s key customers  the company has also entered into agreements with certain key suppliers that are intended to assure anticipated raw material needs to satisfy production requirements for the company s key customers 
certain provisions of these contracts  such as minimum purchase commitments and prices  have been renegotiated in the past and may be renegotiated in the future to meet changing business conditions and to address boeing s underperformance under its lta 
acquisitions and capital transactions during the past five years 
at the beginning of  the company was owned by tremont corporation tremont and its operations were conducted primarily in the united states 
during  the company expanded both geographically and operationally as a result of the acquisition of the titanium business of imi plc  the acquisition of certain assets from axel johnson metals  inc and certain smaller acquisitions in europe 
in  timet i acquired loterios spa to increase market share in industrial markets  and provide increased geographic sales coverage in europe  ii purchased for cash million of non voting and non marketable preferred securities of special metals corporation  a us manufacturer of wrought nickel based superalloys and special alloy long products  and iii entered into a castings joint venture with wyman gordon 
in january  the company sold its interest in the castings joint venture for million and realized a gain of million on the sale 
these transactions are more fully described in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
in  tremont purchased additional timet common stock in market transactions 
in  tremont exercised an option to purchase approximately two million shares of the company s common stock 
at december   tremont held approximately of timet s outstanding common stock 
an additional of timet s outstanding common stock is owned by the combined master retirement trust  a trust formed by valhi  inc valhi  an affiliate of tremont  to permit the collective investment by trusts that maintain the assets of certain employee benefit plans adopted by valhi and related entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium producer whose products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  melted products comprised of titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
in  all of timet s sales were generated by the company s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment 
the titanium product chain is described below 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores  derived from beach sand  with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
the company s titanium sponge production capacity in henderson  nevada  incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the reactor mass into the condensing vessel 
the titanium mass is then mechanically pushed out of the original reactor  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingots and slabs are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each is formed by melting titanium sponge or scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products 
the melting process for ingots and slabs is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
ingots and slabs are both sold to customers and further processed into mill products 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing  welding and or extrusion of titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
the company sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to the company s service centers 
the company s customers usually process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  the company performs extensive testing on its products  including sponge  ingot and mill products 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing and ultrasonic and x ray testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
the company is reliant on several outside processors to perform certain rolling and finishing steps in the us  and certain melting  forging and finishing steps in france 
in the us  one of the processors that performs these steps in relation to strip production and another as relates to plate finishing are owned by a competitor 
these processors are currently the sole source for these services 
other processors used in the us are not competitors 
in france the processor is also a joint venture partner in the company s owned subsidiary  timet savoie 
although the company believes that there are other metal producers with the capability to perform these same processing functions  arranging for alternative processors  or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in the short term 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying elements 
the company processes rutile ore into titanium tetrachloride and further processes the titanium tetrachloride into titanium sponge 
during  approximately of the company s melted and mill product production was made from internally produced sponge  from purchased sponge  from titanium scrap and from alloying elements 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
titanium containing rutile ore is currently available from a number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa  india and the united states 
a majority of the company s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its raw material supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which the company purchases its raw materials could materially and adversely affect availability 
although the company believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single supplier near the company s sponge plant 
the company believes that this supplier is experiencing certain financial difficulties and  accordingly  there can be no assurances the chlorine supply from this provider may not be interrupted 
the company is in the process of evaluating whether to make certain equipment modifications to enable it to utilize alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase an intermediate product which will allow the company to bypass the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium ingot are available from a number of suppliers 
while the company was one of six major worldwide producers of titanium sponge in  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a substantial portion of its sponge requirements 
titanium mill and melted products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
recently  allegheny technologies  inc announced that it was idling its titanium sponge production facility  making timet the only active us producer of titanium sponge 
as a consequence  the company believes the availability of certain grades of titanium sponge  principally premium quality sponge  used for certain aerospace applications currently is tight 
presently  timet and certain suppliers in japan are the only producers of premium quality sponge 
historically  the company has purchased sponge predominantly from producers in japan and kazakhstan 
in the company expects to purchase sponge principally from japan  kazakhstan  and from the us defense logistics agency s stockpile of sponge 
timet has a ten year lta for the purchase of titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan to support demand for both aerospace and non aerospace applications 
the sponge contract runs through  with firm pricing through subject to certain possible adjustments and possible early termination in 
the contract provides for annual purchases by the company of  to  metric tons 
the company agreed to reduced minimums of  metric tons for and  metric tons for the company has no other long term sponge supply agreements 
markets and customer base 
about of the company s sales were to customers within north america  with about to european customers and the balance to other regions 
during and  precision castparts corporation pcc acquired wyman gordon company and a forging company in the uk sales to pcc and these related entities aggregated of the company s net sales in approximately of the company s mill product sales were used by the company s customers to produce parts and other materials for the aerospace industry 
sales under the company s lta s with certain major aerospace customers accounted for approximately of its aerospace sales in the company expects that while a majority of its sales will be to the aerospace industry  other markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial aircraft  european aeronautic defence and space company parent company of the airbus consortium and boeing commercial airplane group  and four major manufacturers of aircraft engines rolls royce  pratt whitney a unit of united technologies corporation  general electric and snecma 
the company s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on the company 
the company s order backlog was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during although the company believes that the backlog is a reliable indicator of near term business activity  conditions in the aerospace industry could change and result in future cancellations or deferrals of existing aircraft orders and materially and adversely affect the company s existing backlog  orders  and future financial condition and operating results 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total fly weight than narrow body planes 
fly weight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines but without fuel or passengers 
the boeing  for example  utilizes titanium for approximately of total fly weight  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to of total backlog at the end of although airbus has announced that it intends to build the new wide body a  no orders for the a were included in the airline monitor s backlog figures at december  as firm order agreements were unconfirmed 
additionally  the a is still being designed  therefore  reliable estimates of titanium usage on the a are not available at this time 
through various strategic relationships  the company seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  europe  former soviet union fsu and china 
with the idling of allegheny technologies sponge manufacturing facility discussed above  the company will be one of four integrated producers in the world  with integrated producers being considered as those that produce at least both sponge and ingot 
there are also a number of non integrated producers that produce mill products from purchased sponge  scrap or ingot 
the company s principal competitors in aerospace markets are allegheny technologies inc  rti international metals  inc 
and verkhanya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo 
these companies  along with the japanese producers and other companies  are also principal competitors in industrial markets 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates  tariffs and  with respect to japan and the fsu  existing and prior duties including antidumping duties 
however  imports of titanium sponge  scrap  and mill products  principally from the fsu  have increased in recent years and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing such sponge  scrap or intermediate mill products from such countries for use in its own operations during recent years  the negative effect of these imports on the company has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports into the us of titanium products from countries designated by the us government as most favored nations are subject to a tariff for other countries 
titanium products for tariff purposes are broadly classified as either wrought or unwrought 
wrought products include bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing 
unwrought products include sponge  ingot  slab and billet 
starting in  imports of titanium wrought products from russia were exempted from this duty under the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to aid developing economies 
in  gsp benefits to these products were suspended when the level of russian wrought products imports reached of all imports of titanium wrought products 
a petition was filed in to restore duty free status to these products  and that petition was granted in june in addition  a petition was also filed to bring unwrought products under the gsp program  which would allow such products from the countries of the fsu notably russia and  in the case of sponge  kazakhstan and ukraine to be imported into the us without the payment of regular duties 
this petition concerning unwrought products has not been acted upon pending further investigation of the merits of such a change 
in addition to regular duties  titanium sponge imported from countries of the fsu russia  kazakhstan and ukraine had for many years been subject to substantial antidumping penalties 
titanium sponge imports from japan were also subject to a standing antidumping order  but no penalties had been attached in recent years 
in  the international trade commission itc revoked all outstanding antidumping orders on titanium sponge based upon a determination that changed circumstances in the industry did not warrant continuation of the orders 
timet has appealed that decision and the matter is still pending 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  all or any of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
however  the company has  in recent years  been a large importer of foreign titanium sponge and mill products into the us to the extent the company remains a substantial purchaser of these products  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to the company for these products to the extent it currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be modified without substantial expenditures to process titanium products 
the company believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
this is achieved through developments in process technology  development of new alloys and products and enhancing the performance of the company s existing products 
applications for timet s proprietary alloys  such as timetal r  timetal and timetal lcb  continue to develop 
the company conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson  nevada laboratory  which the company believes is one of the largest titanium research and development centers in the world 
additional research and development activities are performed at the witton facility in birmingham  england 
patents and trademarks 
the company holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
the company continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by the company do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
the company believes that the trademarks timet r and timetal r  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are significant to its business 
employees 
the historic cyclical nature of the aerospace business and its impact on the company s business is the principal reason that the company periodically implements cost reduction  reorganization and other changes that impact the company s employment levels 
the following table shows the significant reduction in the number of employees over the past years 
the reduction in employees from to was principally in response to a reduction in market demand 
during  the company reduced employment by an additional people  or approximately of timet s worldwide workforce 
however  in the third quarter of the company began increasing production levels and employment at certain facilities in response to an increase in demand for its products 
during  the company expects to add approximately people  principally in its manufacturing operations 
employees at december  us    europe  total    the company s production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada and its production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in october and june  respectively 
in september  the company entered into a new  four year collective bargaining agreement with the uswa representing approximately hourly workers at its henderson  nevada facility 
employees at the company s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
approximately of the salaried and hourly employees at the company s european facilities are represented by various european labor unions  generally under annual agreements 
in march  the company was notified that certain workers at cezus plant in ugine  france were engaged in a work slowdown related to wage and benefit issues 
cezus performs certain melting and forging operations on a contract basis for timet savoie 
while this slowdown may adversely impact shipments by timet savoie to its customers in the near term  based upon the company s current understanding of the situation  the company does not presently anticipate that this action will have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of the company 
while the company currently considers its employee relations to be satisfactory  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages that could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory and environmental matters 
the company s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the occupational  safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
the company uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in addition  at the company s henderson  nevada facility  the company produces and uses substantial quantities of titanium tetrachloride  a material classified as extremely hazardous under federal environmental laws 
the company has used such substances throughout the history of its operations 
as a result  risk of environmental damage is inherent in the company s operations 
the company s operations pose a continuing risk of accidental releases of  and worker exposure to  hazardous or toxic substances 
there is also a risk that government environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company s operations in europe are similarly subject to foreign laws and regulations respecting environmental and worker safety matters  which laws have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow of the company 
the company believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker health and safety laws 
the company s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
from time to time  the company may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties 
the company incurred capital expenditures for health  safety and environmental compliance matters of approximately million in each of and and million in the company s capital budget provides for approximately million of such expenditures in however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental  health or safety laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general 
the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately of us and to of worldwide titanium mill product consumption 
accordingly  the aerospace industry has a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium metals industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
the company estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products peaked in at approximately  metric tons 
industry mill product shipments subsequently declined approximately in to an estimated  metric tons  with a further decline to an estimated  metric tons in and the company expects that worldwide industry mill product shipments will increase in by approximately to about  metric tons 
the expected increase is primarily attributable to stronger demand resulting from an increase in forecasted commercial aircraft build rates as well as a decrease in the amount of excess titanium inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain 
mill product shipments to the aerospace industry in represented about of total industry demand and about of the company s annual mill product shipments 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components ie blades  discs  rings and engine cases and air frame components ie bulkheads  tail sections  landing gears  wing supports and fasteners can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
industry shipments of mill products to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of aerospace demand and of aggregate titanium mill product demand 
the company believes that demand for mill products for the commercial aerospace sector will be the principal driver of the expected increase in industry mill product shipments during demand growth for these markets and sectors is expected to exceed the aggregate growth in titanium mill product shipments while other markets are expected to experience lesser growth 
shipments to the commercial aerospace sector represented approximately of the company s sales volume in accordingly  the company believes its sales volume in may increase more than the expected increase in titanium industry mill product shipments 
the present business environment is substantially different from that in to during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
this resulted in considerable excess inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain 
during  aerospace customers continued to focus on reducing inventories  and a significant number of the company s aerospace customers canceled or delayed previously scheduled orders 
the aerospace supply chain is fragmented and decentralized making it difficult to quantify excess inventories 
however  customer actions such as order delays ie pushouts and cancellations  combined with other data provide limited visibility 
during  the company experienced no significant customer pushouts or cancellations of deliveries 
late in and early  the company experienced an increase in orders for aerospace quality titanium products  and certain customers requested advanced delivery of existing orders and its order backlog increased substantially 
although quantitative information is not readily available  these factors and others lead the company to believe that the excess titanium inventory throughout the supply chain has been substantially reduced and is unlikely to be a significant factor in in most areas 
the company s order backlog increased to approximately million at december  from million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during the company announced selling price increases on new orders for certain grades of titanium products  principally aerospace quality products  late in and early in the announced price increases ranged from to while the announced price increases ranged from to 
the price changes were intended to reflect increases in certain manufacturing costs  including raw materials and energy  as well as the company s need to improve financial performance 
the price increases did not apply to certain industrial products or to orders under lta s and other agreements with customers that contain specific provisions governing selling prices 
accordingly  about of the company s annual sales are expected to be eligible for these price increases 
several other titanium companies have also recently announced price increases  particularly for aerospace quality titanium products 
actual selling price increases are subject to negotiations with customers and may differ materially from announced increases 
outlook 
the outlook section contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
see note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies regarding commitments  contingencies  legal  environmental  and other matters  which information is incorporated herein by reference and may affect the company s future results of operations and liquidity 
sales revenue in is expected to approximate million  reflecting the combined effects of increased sales volume  price increases on certain products and changes in product mix 
the company expects its mill products sales volume to increase to in compared to levels  while melted product sales volume is expected to remain near levels 
the company believes its mill products sales volume may grow more than the forecasted increase in titanium industry shipments because the proportion of the company s sales to the commercial aerospace sector approximately of the company s sales exceeds the total industry mill product shipments to that sector approximately of industry mill shipments 
demand growth for the commercial aerospace sector is expected to exceed the aggregate growth in titanium industry shipments of mill products while other markets and sectors are expected to experience lesser growth 
selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual currency exchange rates during the respective periods on aerospace product shipments  while difficult to forecast  are expected to rise gradually during however  the recently announced price increases are expected to principally affect the second half of due to associated product lead times 
average selling prices per kilogram  as reported by the company  reflect the net effects of changes in selling prices  currency exchange rates  customer and product mix 
accordingly  average selling prices are not necessarily indicative of any one factor 
the company s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including  among others  customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor and energy costs 
restructuring  asset impairments and other special charges have occurred in the past and may occur in the future causing operating results to vary from expectations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gross margins as a percent of sales are presently expected to increase over the year  however  energy and other cost increases could substantially offset expected realized selling price increases in timet is experiencing increases in energy costs as a result of recent increases in natural gas and electricity prices in the us the largest portion of the cost increases are presently associated with electrical power at the company s henderson  nevada facility where titanium sponge is produced and melted 
the company purchases electricity from both hydro and fossil fuel sources  with hydropower being substantially less costly 
the company purchases fossil fuel power to supplement its electricity needs above the amount it can buy from hydro sources 
as the company increases production rates during at its nevada facility  more fossil fuel power is required as a percentage of total power consumed 
energy costs in comprised about of the company s cost of sales 
energy costs may fluctuate substantially from period to period and may adversely affect the company s gross margins causing actual results to differ significantly from expected amounts 
in march  the company was notified by one of its customers that a product manufactured from standard grade titanium produced by the company contained what has been confirmed to be a tungsten inclusion 
the company believes that the source of this tungsten was contaminated silicon purchased from an outside vendor in the silicon was used as an alloying addition to the titanium at the melting stage 
the company is currently investigating the possible scope of this problem  including an evaluation of the identities of customers who received material manufactured using this silicon and the applications to which such material has been placed by such customers 
at the present time  the company is aware of only a single ingot that has been demonstrated to contain tungsten inclusions  however  further investigation may identify other material that has been similarly affected 
until this investigation is completed  the company is unable to determine the possible remedial steps that may be required and whether the company might incur any material liability with respect to this matter 
the company currently believes that it is unlikely that its insurance policies will provide coverage for any costs that may be associated with this matter 
however the company currently intends to seek full recovery from the silicon supplier for any liability the company might incur in this matter  although no assurances can be given that the company will ultimately be able to recover all or any portion of such amounts 
at december   the company had not recorded any liability related to this matter 
the amount of liability the company may ultimately incur related to this matter is not reasonably estimable at this time 
in march  the company was notified that certain workers at cezus plant in ugine  france were engaged in a work slowdown related to wage and benefit issues 
cezus performs certain melting and forging operations on a contract basis for timet savoie 
while this slowdown may adversely impact shipments by timet savoie to its customers in the near term  based upon the company s current understanding of the situation  the company does not presently anticipate that this action will have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of the company 
depreciation and amortization expense for is expected to approximate levels 
the company intends to maintain selling  general  administrative  and development costs relatively constant as a percent of sales  however  this is dependent on  among other things  how the business cycle develops 
interest expense and minority interest expense on the company s convertible preferred securities in is also expected to approximate levels for the full year 
the company s effective consolidated tax benefit rate in should approximate the us statutory rate 
however  the company operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income loss can impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
for financial reporting purposes  the company has recognized the tax benefit of substantially all of its net operating loss carryforwards  and expects that tax benefits to be recognized during will principally be deferred income tax benefits with cash income tax payments expected in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the company periodically reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets to determine whether future realization is more likely than not 
based on such periodic reviews  the company could record an additional valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company presently expects to report both an operating loss and a net loss in  however  the company believes the losses in will be substantially reduced from levels 
the company expects to generate positive cash flow from operations in  but at levels substantially reduced from receivables and inventory levels are expected to increase in to support the anticipated increase in sales whereas both receivables and inventories decreased in the company presently intends to continue to defer dividends on its convertible preferred securities during the company may consider resuming the payment of dividends on the convertible preferred securities or purchase the securities if the outlook for timet s operating results improves substantially or a favorable result in the boeing related litigation is achieved  or both 
dividends on the company s common stock are prohibited under the company s us credit agreement 
capital spending for is currently expected to be million  covering principally capacity enhancements  capital maintenance  and safety and environmental projects 
net debt is expected to increase in as compared to year end levels 
at december   the company had approximately million of borrowing availability under its various worldwide credit agreements 
the company believes its cash  cash flow from operations  and borrowing availability will satisfy its expected working capital  capital expenditures and other requirements in historical operating information 
year ended december  in millions net sales operating income loss percent change in mill product sales volume mill product selling prices melted product sales volume melted product selling prices change expressed in us dollars net sales and operating loss compared to sales of mill products in declined from million in to million in this decrease is due to a decline in mill product selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  a less than decrease in sales volume  and changes in product mix 
in billing currencies which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation  mill product selling prices declined from melted product sales increased from million in to million in due to the net effects of a increase in melted product sales volume  a decline in melted product selling prices and changes in product mix 
the decrease in the selling prices was principally due to greater price competition in the company s non lta business 
early in  the company implemented a plan to address then current market and operating conditions  which resulted in the recognition of a net million restructuring charge in the restructuring charge is included in the operating loss of the titanium melted and mill products segment and is principally related to personnel severance and benefits for the approximately employees terminated as part of the restructuring 
additionally  the company recorded net special charges of million  consisting of million of equipment related impairment charges  million of environmental remediation charges  a special income item of million related to the termination of the company s agreement to sell titanium sponge to union titanium sponge corporation  and the million gain on the sale of the company s castings joint venture 
total cost of sales in was of sales compared to in the increase in the percentage is principally the result of lower average selling prices and a shift in product mix  partially offset by lower raw material costs and lower operating expenses 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses decreased in compared to principally due to the impact of the restructuring plan implemented in early as well as reduced expenses related to the business enterprise information system project that was completed in early and year computer systems expenses which were incurred in but not equity in earnings losses of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment in decreased by million from principally due to the decline in earnings of valtimet  the company s owned welded tube joint venture 
sales and operating income compared to the titanium melted and mill product segment net sales in decreased compared to primarily due to a decrease in mill products shipment volume resulting primarily from reduced demand in the aerospace market 
mill product selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods for were approximately lower than reflecting both the price effect of long term agreements and increased price competition on non lta business 
in billing currencies  mill product selling prices declined from as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company produced approximately million of titanium ingots in  for which the customer was billed but income recognition was deferred 
approximately of this material was shipped in the decrease in net sales of the other segment is a result of the company s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
total cost of sales in was of sales compared to in the increase in the percentage is a result of the lower selling prices  lower production volumes  higher depreciation  and increased reserves for slow moving inventory 
yield  rework and deviated material costs were also higher and plant operating rates were lower 
selling  general  administrative and developmental expenses in were lower than in dollar terms due in large part to the completion of the implementation of the initial phase of the company s business enterprise system during the first half of these costs as a percentage of sales  however  increased to approximately primarily due to the decline in sales 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded million of special charges consisting of million of restructuring charges and million of write downs associated with the company s investment in certain start up joint ventures 
during the same quarter  the company also recorded a million charge to cost of sales for slow moving inventory 
approximately half of the restructuring charges were non cash  primarily related to the disposition of a germany subsidiary  with the cash component relating to the termination of people 
the million charge for slow moving inventory and million of the million of special charges are included in the operating loss of the titanium melted and mill products segment in operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million 
operating losses of the other segment included million and million of special charges in and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
equity in earnings losses of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment decreased by million from principally due to the decline in earnings of valtimet

european operations 
the company has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom  with smaller operations in france  italy and germany 
titanium is a worldwide market and the factors influencing the company s us and european operations are substantially the same 
approximately of the company s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound and european currencies tied to the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge and alloys  for the company s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  thus  the us dollar value of these subsidiaries sales and costs denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  including sales and costs denominated in us dollars  are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results
