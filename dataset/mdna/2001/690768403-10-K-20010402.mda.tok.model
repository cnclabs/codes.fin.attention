the estimate is based on a comprehensive review of the company s asbestos related assets and liabilities completed during the third quarter of the estimate includes consideration of the negative impact of recent bankruptcy filings  particularly the most recent filing by owens corning and fibreboard corporation on october  the estimate does not include the possibility of partial relief in the form of tax or other legislation that could result in funds to compensate asbestos claimants 
a former business unit of the company produced a minor amount of specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from until  when the business was sold to owens corning 
in line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business years ago  the company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the company s products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law 
capital resources and liquidity the company s total debt at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  at december   the company had available credit totaling billion under its agreement with a group of banks bank credit agreement expiring in december  of which million had not been utilized

the company is contemplating sales of non core businesses and assets  the completion of which will provide additional cash 
the company faces additional demands upon its liquidity for asbestos related payments 
based on the company s expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and its expectation of the collection of its insurance coverage for partial reimbursement for such lawsuits and claims  and also based on the company s expected operating cash flow  the company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims  and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos  will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity on a short term or long term basis

this represents and of total assets  and and of share owners equity at december  and  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair values assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired  and is amortized over years

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
the company is not a party to any material derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by affiliates in foreign jurisdictions 
the primary foreign markets served by the company s affiliates are in australia  south america principally colombia  brazil and venezuela  and europe principally italy  the united kingdom  and poland 
in general  revenues earned and costs incurred by the company s major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company s affiliates operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the reported dollar value of local currency ebit generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency ebit generally increases 
subject to other business and tax considerations  the company s strategy is to mitigate the economic effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on that portion of foreign currency ebit which is expected to be invested elsewhere or remitted to the parent company 
the company s foreign affiliates generally invest their excess funds in us dollars or dollar based instruments  where such instruments are available with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  however  this strategy exposes the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the company believes that the benefit of investing excess cash in us dollars or their equivalent outweighs the risk of reporting losses or gains from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in those countries with hyper inflationary economies  where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  this investment strategy for excess funds mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains 
because most of the company s foreign affiliates operate within their local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable 
considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
in those countries where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  however  local currency borrowings expose the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the company s bank credit agreement provides for a billion loan revolving facility which is available to certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries and denominated in certain foreign currencies 
as of december   amounts outstanding under the offshore loan revolving facility were as follows millions of foreign currency amount us dollars billion australian dollars million british pounds billion italian lira the remaining portion of the company s consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant 
the company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the financial instruments ie cash  short term investments  and long term debt of its foreign affiliates 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates applicable to its us dollar indebtedness 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates  the company could  at its option  convert to fixed interest rates by either refinancing variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or entering into interest rate swaps 
the following table provides information about the company s significant interest rate risk at december  outstanding fair value millions of dollars variable rate debt bank credit agreement  matures december revolving loans and bid rate loans  interest at a eurodollar based rate plus   offshore loans  interest at the applicable offshore base rate as defined in the bank credit agreement as follows billion australian dollars million british pounds billion italian lira fixed rate debt senior notes  due  due  due  due senior debentures  due  due forward looking statements this document may contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements reflect the company s best assessment at the time  and thus involve uncertainty and risk 
it is possible the company s future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to the following foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  change in capital availability or cost  including interest rate fluctuations  the general political  economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the company has operations  including competitive pricing pressures  inflation or deflation  and changes in tax rates  consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging  fluctuations in raw material and labor costs  availability of raw materials  costs and availability of energy  transportation costs  consolidation among competitors and customers  the ability of the company to integrate operations of acquired businesses  the performance by customers of their obligations under purchase agreements  and the timing and occurrence of events which are beyond the control of the company 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors
