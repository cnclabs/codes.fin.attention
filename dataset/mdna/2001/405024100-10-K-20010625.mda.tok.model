with currency rates held constant  disposable sales increased 
year over year constant currency disposable sales growth was a result of growth in worldwide red cell sales of  worldwide surgical sales of and worldwide plasma sales of 
the increase in worldwide red cell sales is attributable to volume increases in both the us and europe as the rollout of this new technology in these markets continues to gain strength 
the growth in worldwide surgical disposable sales is mainly attributed to volume increase and the mix effect of products sold in the us and japan markets 
the company views the increasing prices of red cells around the world and the favorable autotransfusion economics its surgical product offerings deliver  as factors contributing to the volume increases 
the increase in plasma disposable sales is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the new plasma collection bottle and the addition of the newly approved anticoagulant to the plasma product line in the us market 
constant currency sales of disposable products  excluding service and other miscellaneous revenue  accounted for approximately and of net revenues for fiscal year and  respectively 
service generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings and miscellaneous revenues accounted for and of the company s net revenues  at constant currency  for fiscal year and  respectively 
equipment revenues decreased from million in fiscal at actual rates and decreased year over year with currency rates held constant 
the decrease was a result of lower equipment revenues in the surgical and plasma product lines  mainly in the us  and in asia due to a large equipment sale in the prior year 
the overall decrease in revenue recognized on equipment shipments represents a continuing trend of customer preference for  and the company s policy of  moving toward placing on loan company owned equipment versus selling it under long term  sales type leases 
reasons for customer preference vary significantly but include the customers preference to be relieved from certain risks of ownership  particularly the equipment s economic useful life and technological obsolescence 
from the company s point of view  placing company owned equipment versus selling it  allows the company to better track the location and the utilization of the equipment 
international sales as reported accounted for approximately and of net revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
as in the us  sales outside the us are susceptible to risks and uncertainties from regulatory changes  the company s ability to forecast product demand and market acceptance of the company s products  changes in economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing and changes in health care policy 
gross profit gross profit of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal with currency rates held constant  gross profit increased by  or million  but decreased as a percentage of sales by 
the million constant currency gross profit increase from fiscal was a result of higher sales and reflected cost savings of approximately million from the company s customer oriented redesign for excellence core program 
in  the company initiated the core program to increase operational effectiveness and improve all aspects of customer service 
the core program is based on total quality management  tqm principals  and the program aims to increase the efficiency and the quality of processes and products  and to improve the quality of management at haemonetics 
the million in savings for resulted from lower product costs achieved by automation and redesigning the way certain products are made to use less material and labor and by negotiating lower material prices with vendors 
these savings were partially offset by increases in other product costs 
expenses the company expended million  of net revenues  on research and development for and million  of net revenues  for with currency rates held constant  research and development spending increased by  or million from fiscal to the increase in research and development spending is in line with the company s objective to reinvest available funds into new product development and new product selling and marketing activities in order to fuel future top line growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal at constant currency rates  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of net revenues by to 
offsetting increases in spending related to the company s new product selling and marketing activities  were cost savings of approximately million from the company s core program 
the million savings for was due to reductions in distribution related selling  general and administrative expenses 
more specifically  distribution savings were generated by lowering freight costs and the move of the company s european distribution center from the netherlands to germany 
in process research and development ipr d upon consummation of the transfusion technologies acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal  the company incurred costs representing the value of the research and development projects 
included in the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of transfusion technologies was an aggregate amount of purchased in process research and development ipr d of million  million of which is reflected in the restatement of fiscal year relative to haemonetics original investment and million of which is reflected in consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  the values represent purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amounts were immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations see note in the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition and ipr d charges 
an independent valuation was performed to assess and allocate a value to the purchased ipr d 
the value represents the estimated fair market value based on risk adjusted future cash flows generated by the products employing the in process technology over a year period 
estimated future after tax cash flows for each product were based on transfusion s and haemonetics estimates of revenue  operating expenses  income taxes  and charges for the use of contributory assets 
additionally  these cash flows were adjusted to compensate for the existence of any core technology and development efforts that were to be completed post acquisition 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles  and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses include cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative  and research and development r d expenses 
the estimated r d expenses include only those costs needed to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market 
operating expense estimates were consistent with expense levels for similar products 
the discount rates used to present value the projected cash flows were based on a weighted average cost of capital relative to transfusion technologies and its industry adjusted for the product specific risk associated with the purchased ipr d projects 
product specific risk includes such factors as the stage of completion of each project  the complexity of the development work completed to date  the likelihood of achieving technological feasibility and market acceptance 
the forecast data employed in the valuation were based upon projections created by transfusion s management and haemonetics management s estimate of the future performance of the business 
the inputs used in valuing the purchased ipr d were based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events or circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the forecasted results 
while management believes that all of the development projects will be successfully completed  failure of any of these projects to achieve technological feasibility  and or any variance from forecasted results  may result in a material adverse effect on haemonetics financial condition and results of operations 
a brief description of the ipr d projects related to the acquisition of transfusion  including their estimated stage of completion and associated discount rates is outlined below 
chairside separator css 
the css is a portable  automated device used for the donor side collection and processing of a single unit of whole blood into a unit of red cell concentrate and plasma 
the system is designed for use in a blood center  hospital  or mobile blood drive location and can be powered either through a standard ac outlet or by dc battery packs 
at the time of the acquisition  haemonetics estimated that the css project was complete and that product sales would commence by the fourth quarter of fiscal the ipr d value assigned to the css was million 
a discount rate of was employed in the analysis 
as of the fourth quarter ending march  the company estimates that the css project is complete with only the clinical safety study remaining to be completed prior to submission of the k to the fda  which is anticipated in the second quarter of fiscal product sales will commence upon approval by the fda which could be one year  or greater  from submission date 
the estimated cost to complete the final clinical trials is approximately  and will be incurred in the first quarter and second quarters of fiscal red cell collector rcc 
the rcc is a portable  automated device used for the collection and processing of two units of red blood cells from donors 
the system collects and automatically anticoagulates the whole blood while separating it into red blood cells and plasma 
the plasma and ml of saline is then re infused back to the donor 
the system is designed for use in a blood center  hospital  or mobile blood drive location and can be powered either through a standard ac outlet or by dc battery packs 
at the time of the acquisition  haemonetics estimated that the rcc project was complete and that product sales would commence by the second quarter the ipr d value assigned to the rcc was million 
a discount rate of was employed in the analysis 
as of the fourth quarter ending march   the company s estimate of percent completion remained unchanged from prior estimates of 
as such  the expected date that product sales will commence is fiscal all other estimates for cost of sales  s  g a costs and income tax rates relative to the rcc project are unchanged from original estimates with the exception of timing 
significant design  software programming  disposable set development and sourcing requirements are still to be completed 
in addition  clinical trials will be conducted prior to submission of a k to the fda 
the estimated cost to be incurred to develop the purchased in process rcc technology into a commercially viable product is approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal other unusual charges a relating to the acquisition of transfusion technologies unusual charges expensed in the twelve months ended march   as a result of the acquisition of transfusion technologies amounted to million 
these charges included million in bonuses paid to key transfusion executives hired by haemonetics and severance to haemonetics employees laid off due to overlaps created by the merger  a million write off of an investment in technology which haemonetics decided not to pursue in lieu of the technologies acquired in the merger  and the adjustment required to modify the investment of transfusion by haemonetics in november of fiscal year from the cost method to the equity method of accounting as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
to effect this change  the historic cost of the investment made by haemonetics was written down by its share of the losses incurred by transfusion technologies from november of fiscal year through the date of acquisition of the remaining 
the charge to the consolidated statement of operations related to this cost to equity adjustment was million in fiscal year and million in fiscal b other beginning in fiscal year  the company placed approximately  plasma collection machines in china under a sales type lease contract with a local distributor 
the sales type lease contract included minimum annual disposable products use commitments per machine under contract and included a ramp up period 
in march of  the company reassessed its ability to realize the full value of the sales type lease as originally recorded given that the ramp up in disposable purchases expected had not materialized 
in the company s opinion two main factors or market conditions contributed to the distributor s failure to meet its disposable purchase commitments 
although it passed an executive order in making manual plasma collection unlawful  the chinese government failed to enforce this and manual plasma collection  which is much less costly for the collector  continues for a large percentage of total plasma collections 
secondly  the availability of  and lack of enforcement against  unauthorized local copies of disposable products at a lower cost  significantly impacted purchases from foreign suppliers 
given the change in market conditions  a reassessment of the contract was performed with a new estimate of future disposable purchases and related cash flows considering the reduced percentage of the market willing to use automated collection with foreign manufactured products and because of pricing concessions extended to the local distributor by haemonetics 
based on the reassessment  the company wrote down the investment in sales type leases by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and reflected this as an unusual charge on its consolidated statement of operations 
operating income operating income for  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal at constant currency rates  operating income decreased from fiscal or by million 
the million decrease in operating income resulted largely from the million year over year increase in combined ipr d and other unusual items related to the acquisition of transfusion technologies and million in combined increases in operating expenses for investments in r d and new product selling and marketing programs offset by the non recurrence of the million write down of the sales type lease in china in fiscal and the million increase in gross profit at constant currency rates 
foreign exchange greater than two thirds of the company s revenues are generated outside the us in foreign currencies 
as such  the company uses a combination of business and financial tools comprised of various natural hedges  offsetting exposures from local production costs and operating expenses and forward contracts to hedge its balance sheet and statement of operations exposures 
the purpose of the company s hedging activities is to minimize  for a period of time  the unforeseen impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
the company enters into forward contracts  generally one year out  to hedge firm disposable sales commitments to customers  after consideration of natural hedges  that are denominated in foreign currencies  mainly japanese yen and the euro 
actual gains and losses on all forward contracts are recorded in operations  offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged 
while the company s hedging program does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates  it fixes rates for a period of one year  thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation 
the company computes a composite rate index for purposes of measuring  comparatively  the change in foreign currency hedge spot rates from the hedge spot rates of the corresponding period in the prior year 
the relative value of currencies in the index corresponds to the value of sales in those currencies 
the composite was set at based upon the weighted rates at march  for fiscal year  the indexed hedge rates were less favorable than those in fiscal for fiscal  the indexed hedge spot rates represented a appreciation over those in year  and for fiscal year  the indexed hedge spot rates are less favorable than those in fiscal these indexed hedge rates represent the change in spot value value on the day the hedge contract is undertaken of the haemonetics specific hedge rate index 
these indexed hedge rates impact sales  cost of sales and sg a in the company s financial statements 
the final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results 
composite index favorable unfavorable hedge spot rates change vs prior year fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q q q q total other income  net interest expense decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a reduction in the average outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates 
interest income decreased million for compared to fiscal other income  net increased million due to increases in income earned from points on forward contracts  which was partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange transaction losses 
points on forward contracts are amounts  either paid or earned  based on the interest rate differential between two foreign currencies in a forward hedge contract 
taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of pretax income  was for  up from in before the effect of non deductible charges in connection with the acquisition of transfusion technologies  the company s effective tax rate was for  down from in the decrease in the effective tax rate from was primarily attributable to maximizing tax benefits on funds repatriated and increased export benefits generated by the company s foreign sales corporation

disposable sales increased approximately 
with currency rates held constant  disposable sales increased 
the increase was a result of constant currency growth in all product lines worldwide surgical  worldwide blood bank  worldwide red cells and worldwide plasma 
the low growth rate in the plasma business was mainly a result of lower disposable sales in the us plasma market where there was a drop in available donors 
constant currency sales of disposable products  excluding service and other miscellaneous revenue  accounted for approximately and of net revenues for and  respectively 
service revenues generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings and miscellaneous revenues accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues  at constant currency  for and  respectively 
equipment revenues decreased approximately year over year 
at constant currency rates  the equipment revenue was down 
this decrease resulted from a combination of customer preference for  and the company s policy of  moving toward placing company owned equipment versus selling it under long term sales type leases 
reasons for customer preference vary significantly but include the customers preference to be relieved from certain risks of ownership  particularly the equipment s economic useful life and technological obsolescence 
from the company s point of view  placing company owned equipment versus selling it  allows the company to better track the location and the utilization of the equipment

accordingly  the amounts were immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations see note in the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition and ipr d charges 
other unusual charges a relating to the acquisition of transfusion technologies included in other unusual charges is the adjustment required to modify the investment of transfusion technologies corporation by haemonetics in november of fiscal year from the cost method to the equity method of accounting as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
to effect this change  the company recorded its share of the monthly losses incurred by transfusion technologies from november of fiscal year as if the investment had been accounted for under the equity method from its inception 
the charge to the consolidated statement of operations related to this cost to equity adjustment was million for fiscal b other beginning in fiscal year  the company placed approximately  plasma collection machines in china under a sales type lease contract with a local distributor

liquidity and capital resources the company has satisfied its cash requirements principally from internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
the company s capital requirements have arisen primarily in connection with capital expenditures  working capital  share repurchase and strategic investments 
during the twelve months ended march   the company increased its cash balances by million from operating  investing and financing activities before the effect of exchange rates 
this million is million more than the million reduction of cash during the twelve months ended april  the million was a result of million more cash provided by the company s operating activities  million less utilized in investing activities and million resulting from million of cash generated in fiscal versus million utilized in the prior year related to the company s financing activities 
operating activities the company generated million in cash from operating activities of continuing operations in as compared to million generated during the million increase year over year in cash generated from the operating activities from continuing operations was a result of a million increase in net income adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  an million decrease in inventories due to higher finished goods inventory turns and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partly due to increases in accruals related to acquisitions in fiscal these sources of cash were offset by increased uses of cash resulting from a million increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales  a million increase in the current investment in sales type leases  a million increase in prepaid taxes and a million increase in other assets also related to the company s fiscal acquisitions 
the company measures its performance using an operating cash flow metric defined as net income adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment together with the investment in haemonetics equipment at customer sites  including sales type leases  and the change in operating working capital  including change in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses  excluding tax accounts and the effects of currency translation 
this alternative measure of operating cash flows is a non gaap measure that may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
it is intended to assist readers of the report who employ free cash flow and similar measures that do not include tax assets and liabilities  equity investments and other sources and uses that are outside the day to day activities of a company 
as measured by the company s operating cash flow metric  the company generated million and million of operating cash during fiscal and  respectively 
the operating cash generated for both years excludes cash spent to first invest in  and later acquire  transfusion technologies which amounted to million in fiscal and million in the million of operating cash flow in fiscal resulted from million of net income adjusted for non cash items and million from the reduction of the company s net investment in property  plant and equipment and sales type leases 
offsetting these was million from increased working capital investment  primarily higher accounts receivable due to higher sales  with a small increase in inventories of million 
these were offset by million higher accounts payable and accrued payroll 
the million of operating cash generated for resulted from million of net income adjusted for non cash items  a million higher working capital investment  due mainly to increased inventories  and million from the reduction of the company s net investment in property  plant and equipment and sales type leases 
non cash transfers from inventory to property  plant and equipment have been excluded for purposes of this calculation and amounted to approximately million and million in for fiscal and  respectively 
investing activities the company utilized million in cash for investing activities from continuing operations in  a decrease of million from the million decrease in cash utilized is largely attributable to a million net decrease in the company s investment in available for sale securities  offset by million more cash utilized for the acquisition of transfusion technologies and alpha therapeutic s compton california bottle plant 
financing activities during the twelve months ended march   the company generated million of cash as a result of its financing activities  versus the prior year when it used million 
during fiscal  the company refinanced its braintree headquarters real estate mortgage and paid down some of its short term debt in japan 
the company purchased  shares of its outstanding common stock at an average market price of which utilized million of cash  million less than the year ending april   and generated million  million more than the prior year  from the exercise of stock options 
at march   the company had working capital of million 
this reflects an increase of million in working capital from the year ended april   largely due to a shift from short term notes from long term borrowings  and the increase in cash and available for sale investments 
the company believes its sources of cash are adequate to meet its projected needs 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
historically  the company believes it has been able to minimize the effects of inflation by improving its manufacturing and purchasing efficiency  by increasing employee productivity and by reflecting the effects of inflation in the selling prices of new products it introduces each year 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which the company adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year sab no 
provides additional guidance on the accounting for revenue recognition including both broad conceptual discussions  as well as certain industry specific guidance 
the company s adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no

accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 collectively  sfas no 
 as amended effective april  these standards will be adopted as a change in accounting principle and cannot be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  to the extent effective  and requires that the company formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended  in part  allows special hedge accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
the statement provides that the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedging instrument  as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  be recognized currently in earnings in the same accounting period 
sfas no 
 as amended  provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is recognized currently through earnings regardless of whether the instrument is designated as a hedge 
at march   the company had forward contracts  all maturing in less than twelve months  to exchange foreign currencies major european currencies and japanese yen primarily for us dollars totaling million 
of these contracts  six  totaling million  represented contracts with zero fair value relating to inter company receivables put in place at year end  that settle within days after year end 
the company has designated the remainder of these contracts as cash flow hedges intended to lock in the expected cash flows of forecasted foreign currency denominated revenues at the available spot rate 
thus  change in the value of the forward contract unrelated to the spot rate is deemed ineffective and is recorded in earnings 
upon adoption  the company will record the fair value of these contracts as an asset on the balance sheet  the change in fair value of the effective portion of the contracts in other comprehensive income and the change in time value in earnings as a cumulative catch up adjustment 
at march  the company accounted for these contracts as hedges according to sfas no 
and did not record any amounts in the consolidated balance sheet 
had the company accounted for these contracts consistent with sfas no  the estimated cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle would have been as follows in thousands cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in other cumulative effect of asset forward comprehensive change in accounting contracts income principle in earnings cash flow hedges

   at march   there are no embedded derivatives as defined by sfas  as amended  and the company is not aware of any potential impact of any other significant matter that may result from the adoption of these standards 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements contained in this report  as well as oral statements made by the company that are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions and financial trends that may affect the company s future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations and financial position 
these statements are based on the company s current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which the company can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or unanticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include technological advances in the medical field and the company s ability to successfully implement products that incorporate such advances  product demand and market acceptance of the company s products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including europe and asia in which the company operates 
the foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive 
euro currency effective january   of the countries in the european union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  holland  ireland  italy  luxembourg  portugal and spain adopted a single currency known as the euro 
for the three years following january   these countries will be allowed to transact business in both the euro and in their own currencies at fixed exchange rates 
beginning on july   the euro will become the only currency for these countries 
operations in europe the introduction of the euro impacted the company s operations 
the company has subsidiaries located throughout europe  that generate one third of its sales 
date of conversion the conversion at the company s subsidiaries now using the euro currency was successfully achieved on april   which was the first day of the company s fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk over two thirds of the company s revenues are generated outside the us yet the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
foreign exchange risk arises because the company engages in business in foreign countries in local currency 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency 
accordingly  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on the company s results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies  there is a positive effect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to minimize for a period of time the unforeseen impact on its results of operations of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the majority of its firm sales commitments to customers that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also enters into forward contracts that settle within days to hedge certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
actual gains and losses on all forward contracts are recorded in operations  offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged 
these derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the japanese yen and the euro equivalent of the french franc  deutsche mark and italian lire 
at march   the company had the following outstanding foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm sales commitments denominated in foreign currency buy sell weighted discounted hedged local forward us unrealized unrealized currency currency contract rate current fwd gain loss gain loss maturity euro equivalent     apr jun euro equivalent     jul sept euro equivalent     oct dec euro equivalent     jan mar japanese yen  per us    apr jun japanese yen  per us    jul sept japanese yen  per us    oct dec japanese yen  per us    jan mar total    the company estimated the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all forward contracts would create an additional million unrealized gain  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would reduce the unrecorded gain by million
