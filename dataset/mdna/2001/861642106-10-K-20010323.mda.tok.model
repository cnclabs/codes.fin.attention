item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year of the three year period ended december  our financial statements and the notes thereto  which are found elsewhere in this form k  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and operation of oil and gas properties onshore and in shallow waters offshore louisiana 
we have been active in the gulf coast basin since  which gives us extensive geophysical  technical and operational expertise in this area 
historically  we have sought growth primarily through the acquisition and development of mature fields with a prolific production history 
as commodity prices increase and provide financial stability through additional cash flow it becomes more feasible to pursue an aggressive exploratory drilling strategy 
during  we designed a drilling program that provided an acceptable mix of high and low risk projects in an effort to capitalize on an opportunity to test certain prospects that have higher reward potential but are too high risk to drill in periods of low prices 
as a result  we drilled a record number of wells  the majority of which were classified as exploratory wells 
as commodity prices increased  the demand for and the costs of drilling rigs and related services did as well 
in an attempt to hedge against rising drilling costs  we entered into long term fixed dayrate contracts for drilling rigs that are capable of drilling on all our properties and we occasionally entered into turnkey contracts that require a fixed payment upon the completion of a project regardless of the number of drilling days 
the current commodity price environment also impacted the property market 
it is generally more expensive to buy properties at times when oil and gas prices have increased  which is what we witnessed during the year therefore  we pursued stock for stock merger targets and non cash acquisition opportunities such as farmins  whereby we earned a working interest in desirable acreage by drilling a well versus buying the field 
from time to time we enter into hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining commodity prices 
traditionally  these contracts have been in the form of fixed price swaps and collars 
in response to rising commodity prices  we sought a hedging instrument that guaranteed a floor on the prices we would receive for certain production volumes while allowing us to fully participate in commodity price increases 
as such  we purchased put contracts for a portion of our future production that guarantee what we believe to be minimum attractive prices for our hedged volumes 
during  we remained focused on our objectives of increasing production  cash flow and reserves 
we set a company record for annual production by producing billion cubic feet of gas equivalent bcfe 
we also set a record for annual cash flow before working capital changes with results of million representing a increase over results 
finally  at december   we reported bcfe of estimated proved reserves  which is the largest proved reserve base in our history 
our reserve replacement ratio was  which marks the seventh consecutive year that we replaced more than our annual production 
as a result of the basin merger s impact on our production  cash flow and our property base and prospect inventory  we currently expect to implement a significantly expanded capital expenditures program during with an estimated budget of approximately million  we have designed a capital expenditures program that attempts to maximize the potential of our expanded prospect inventory and can be financed by future cash flow 
in addition to drilling  we expect to seek growth opportunities through acquisitions that become more feasible in periods of declining prices 
we will continue to modify our operating strategy to meet the demands of our ever changing industry 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations and summary information with respect to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
see item properties oil and gas reserves 
for combined operating information regarding the merger with basin exploration  see selected comparative financial and operational data in item business 
year ended december  production oil mbbls    gas mmcf produced excluding volumetric production payment    volumetric production payment   total gas volumes produced    oil and gas mmcfe produced excluding volumetric production payment    volumetric production payment   total volumes produced    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf price excluding volumetric production payment volumetric production payment net average price oil and gas per mcfe price excluding volumetric production payment volumetric production payment net average price average costs per mcfe normal operating costs general and administrative costs depreciation  depletion and amortization reserves at december oil mbbls    gas mmcf    oil and gas mmcfe    present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes in thousands    compared to for the year we reported record net income totaling million  or per share  compared to net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
the favorable results in net income were due to improvements in the following components production 
during  production volumes reached a record high totaling bcfe compared to bcfe produced during natural gas production during increased to approximately billion cubic feet compared to gas production of billion cubic feet  while oil production during totaled approximately million barrels compared to million barrels produced during the increase in production rates  compared to  was due to increases at several of our fields  the most significant of which were eugene island block and east cameron block prices 
prices realized during averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
this represents a increase  on an mcfe basis  over average realized prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
all unit pricing amounts include the effects of hedging 
from time to time  we enter into various hedging contracts in order to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining oil and gas prices 
due to increases in commodity prices  hedging transactions reduced the average price we received during the year for oil by per barrel and for gas by per mcf  compared to a net decrease of per barrel and a net increase of per mcf realized during oil and gas revenue 
as a result of higher production rates and realized prices  oil and gas revenue reached a record high during  increasing to million  compared to oil and gas revenue of million 
expenses 
normal operating costs during increased to million  compared to million during on a unit of production basis  operating costs were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in operating costs was due primarily to industry wide increases in the costs of oil field products and services 
during  we performed significant workover operations on nine wells at three fields 
as a result  major maintenance expenses for the year totaled million compared to million for due to increased onshore production volumes combined with higher oil and gas prices  production revenue from onshore properties increased 
as a result  production tax expense increased to million from million in included in the amount was a million production tax refund related to the abatement of severance taxes for certain wells under louisiana state law 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on our oil and gas properties totaled million compared to million for however  on a unit of production basis  this expense was unchanged from the rate of per mcfe 
general and administrative expenses for increased in total to million  or per mcfe  from million  or per mcfe  during due to our operational and financial results and our stock price performance during the year  incentive compensation expense for increased to million compared to million in both general and administrative and incentive compensation expenses for were affected by a increase in our staff level over as a result of the repayment of the borrowings under our bank credit facility in august  interest expense for decreased to million  compared to million during reserves 
at december   our estimated proved oil and gas reserves totaled bcfe  compared to december  reserves of bcfe 
estimated proved gas reserves grew to bcf at the end of from bcf at year end  while estimated proved oil reserves declined to mmbbls at the end of from mmbbls at the beginning of the year 
the increases in our estimated proved reserve volumes were primarily attributable to drilling results and acquisitions during the year 
the reserve estimates were prepared by independent petroleum consultants in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
adherence to these guidelines limited us in booking reserves on certain successfully drilled wells to the extent of the base of known productive sands 
actual limits of the productive sands will ultimately be determined through production or additional drilling 
our present values of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes were billion and million at december  and  respectively 
you should not assume that the present values of estimated future net cash flows represent the fair value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
as required by the sec  we determine the present value of estimated future net cash flows using market prices for oil and gas on the last day of the fiscal period 
the average year end oil and gas prices on all of our properties used in determining these amounts were per barrel and per mcf for and per barrel and per mcf for during the first quarter of  market prices for oil and gas have generally decreased  which would result in a reduction of estimated future net cash flows and the present value of estimated future net cash flows at december  if recomputed 
compared to we recognized net income for the year ended december  totaling million  or per share  compared to the net loss of million  or per share 
the results included an after tax non cash ceiling test write down of million  or per share 
excluding the write down  favorable results in net income versus were due to improvements in the following components production 
production volumes of oil and gas reached a then record high during and  as compared to  rose and  respectively  totaling million barrels of oil and billion cubic feet of gas 
on a thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe basis  production rates for were higher than production rates 
the increase in production rates  compared to  was due primarily to increases at four of our fields 
first  we successfully executed an aggressive exploration and development program at vermilion block by completing and placing on production three exploratory and two development wells 
at the end of  we began producing two high pressured gas wells at the south pelto block e platform  which significantly contributed to s favorable production rates 
from june through august  we successfully drilled one exploratory well  three development wells and completed three workovers to enhance production at clovelly field 
finally  in may  we increased our interest  and therefore our share of production  at weeks island field through the acquisition of an additional working interest in producing wells 
prices 
average realized prices during were per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas and represented a increase  on an mcfe basis  over average prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas recognized during  including the effects of hedging 
from time to time  we enter into various hedging contracts in order to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining oil and gas prices 
during  hedging transactions reduced the average price we received for oil by per barrel and increased the average gas price received by per mcf compared to net increases of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas during oil and gas revenue 
oil and gas revenue reached a then record high during the favorable increases in oil and gas production rates combined with higher commodity prices resulted in oil and gas revenue increasing to million  compared to oil and gas revenue of million during expenses 
normal operating costs during increased to million  compared to million during on a unit of production basis  operating costs were per mcfe compared to per mcfe for the increase in operating costs was due primarily to a increase in the number of producing wells that we operated as a result of the acquisitions of lafitte field  west cameron block and east cameron block  the increases in working interest at east cameron block  eugene island block and weeks island field and discoveries at many of our fields including vermilion block  vermilion block  clovelly field and eugene island block as a result of increased production volumes due to acquisitions and discoveries combined with higher oil and gas prices during the year  production revenue from onshore properties increased during our production tax expense  however  declined during to million from million in this decrease resulted from the abatement of severance taxes for certain wells under louisiana state law 
accordingly  we accrued in december  and received in early  a production tax refund of million 
general and administrative expenses for increased in total to million from million during however  on a unit basis  these costs were unchanged from the amount of per mcfe 
due to our operational results and stock performance during the year  incentive compensation expense for increased to million compared to million in dd a expense on our oil and gas properties decreased to million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe  for the decrease in dd a expense resulted from a combination of the million non cash ceiling test write down of oil and gas properties recorded at the end of and the improvement in oil and gas prices throughout our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  and was net of a million reduction in deferred taxes relative to estimates of tax basis that were resolved during reserves 
at december   our estimated proved oil and gas reserves totaled bcfe  excluding approximately bcf of gas dedicated to a production payment associated with certain acquisitions  compared to december  reserves of bcfe 
estimated proved oil reserves increased to mmbbls at the end of from mmbbls at the beginning of the year  and estimated proved gas reserves grew to bcf at december   excluding the bcf of gas dedicated to a production payment  compared to bcf at year end the increases in our estimated proved reserve volumes were primarily attributable to drilling results and acquisitions made during the year 
the reserve estimates were prepared by independent petroleum consultants in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
adherence to these guidelines limited us in booking reserves on certain successfully drilled wells to the extent of the base of known productive sands 
actual limits of the productive sands will ultimately be determined through production or additional drilling 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital 
net cash flow from operations before working capital changes for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  reported for working capital at december  totaled million 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during totaled million and included million of capitalized general and administrative costs  net of reimbursements  and million of capitalized interest 
these investments were financed by a combination of cash flows from operations and working capital 
merger with basin exploration 
on february   the stockholders of stone energy corporation and basin exploration  inc voted in favor of  and thereby consummated  the combination  through a pooling of interests  of the two companies in a tax free  stock for stock transaction 
in connection with the approval of the merger  stockholders of stone energy also approved a proposal to increase the authorized shares of stone common stock from million to million shares 
under the merger agreement  basin stockholders received of a share of stone common stock for each share of basin common stock they owned 
as such  stone issued approximately million shares of common stock which  based upon stone s closing price of on february   resulted in total equity value related to the transaction of approximately million 
in addition  stone assumed  and subsequently retired with cash on hand  approximately million of basin bank debt 
the expenses incurred in relation to the merger are currently estimated to total million and will be a non recurring item recorded in the first quarter of budgeted capital expenditures and long term financing 
the merger with basin  which was effective february   increased our property base to producing properties by adding gulf coast basin and rocky mountain properties 
our estimated capital expenditures budget of approximately million is expected to be allocated approximately to gulf coast operations and to rocky mountain activities 
the planned investment in the rockies represents over a increase from the investments made by basin in the region during we expect to drill gross wells during  in the onshore and shallow water offshore regions of the gulf coast basin and in the rocky mountains 
approximately of the estimated drilling costs are expected to be dedicated to exploratory targets with the remaining allocated to the development of existing reserves 
while the capital expenditures budget does not include any projected acquisitions  we continue to seek growth opportunities that fit our specific acquisition profile 
our production goal for is to increase production over s combined production of bcfe 
based upon our outlook on oil and gas prices and production rates  we believe that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the current capital expenditures budget 
if oil and gas prices or production rates fall below our current expectations  we believe that the available borrowings under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures in excess of operating cash flows 
we do not budget acquisitions  however  we are currently evaluating several opportunities that fit our specific acquisition profile 
one or a combination of certain of these possible transactions could fully utilize our existing sources of capital 
although we have no plans to access the public markets for purposes of capital  if the opportunity arose  we would consider such funding sources to provide capital in excess of what is currently available to us 
we would compare the cost of debt financing with the potential dilution of equity offerings to determine the appropriate financing vehicle to maximize stockholder value

bank credit facility 
during  our bank group increased the borrowing base under our credit facility to million and extended the maturity date from july  to july  the borrowing base limitation is based on a borrowing base amount established by the banks for our oil and gas properties 
during  we did not draw upon our credit facility  and at december  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
our credit facility provides for certain covenants  including restrictions or requirements with respect to working capital  net worth  disposition of properties  incurrence of additional debt  change of ownership and reporting responsibilities 
these covenants may limit or prohibit us from paying cash dividends 
regulatory and litigation issues 
in august  we were advised by the epa that it believed we were a potentially responsible party a prp for the cleanup of an oil field waste disposal facility located near abbeville  louisiana  which was included on cercla s national priority list the superfund list by the epa in march although we did not dispose of wastes or salt water at this site  the epa contends that transporters of salt water may have rinsed their trucks tanks at this site 
by letter dated december   the epa made demand for cleanup costs on of the prp s  including us  who had not previously settled with the epa 
since that time we  together with other prps  have been negotiating the settlement of our respective liability for environmental conditions at this site with the us department of justice 
given the number of prp s at this site and the current satisfactory progress of these negotiations  we do not believe that any liability for this site would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
a tentative settlement has been reached with the us department of justice regarding our potential liability at this site 
the amount of this tentative settlement is immaterial to our financial statements and was not accrued at december  however  the settlement has not been formally approved by all parties  and we cannot assure you that a settlement will be formally approved 
since november   new levels of lease and area wide bonds have been required of lessees taking certain actions with regard to ocs leases 
operators in the ocs waters of the gulf of mexico were required to increase their area wide bonds and individual lease bonds to million and million  respectively  unless the mms allowed exemptions or reduced amounts 
we currently have an area wide right of way bond for million and an area wide lessee s and operator s bond totaling million issued in favor of the mms for our existing offshore properties 
the mms also has discretionary authority to require supplemental bonding in addition to the foregoing required bonding amounts but this authority is only exercised on a case by case basis at the time of filing an assignment of record title interest for mms approval 
based upon certain financial parameters  we have been granted exempt status by the mms  which exempts us from the supplemental bonding requirements 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require any of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
opa imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party  including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill 
under opa and a mms final rule adopted in august  responsible parties of covered offshore facilities that have a worst case oil spill of more than  barrels must demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts ranging from at least million in specified state waters to at least million in ocs waters  with higher amounts of up to million in certain limited circumstances where the mms believes such a level is justified by the risks posed by the operations or if the worst case oil spill discharge volume possible at the facility may exceed the applicable threshold volumes specified under the mms s final rule 
we do not anticipate that we will experience any difficulty in continuing to satisfy the mms s requirements for demonstrating financial responsibility under the current opa and mms s august final rule 
we operate under numerous state and federal laws enacted for the protection of the environment 
in the ordinary course of business  we conduct an ongoing review of the effects of these various environmental laws on our business and operations 
the estimated cost of continued compliance with current environmental laws  based upon the information currently available  is not material to our results of operations or financial position 
it is impossible to determine whether and to what extent our future performance may be affected by environmental laws  however  we believe that such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we are named as a defendant in certain lawsuits and are a party to certain regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we do not expect these matters  individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
forward looking statements certain of the statements set forth under this item and elsewhere in this form k  including in the documents incorporated by reference  are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
see item business forward looking statements and risk factors 
accounting matters basis of presentation 
the financial statements include our accounts and our proportionate share of certain partnerships 
on december   these partnerships were dissolved after their assets were transferred to us 
all intercompany balances and transactions that existed prior to these dissolutions have been eliminated 
throughout this document we show combined operational and financial information to give effect to the merger with basin exploration  as if the two companies were combined on january  these combined results should be used for information purposes only as they are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the merger had been completed on january  full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition and development costs  including certain related employee costs and general and administrative costs less any reimbursements for such costs  incurred for the purpose of acquiring and finding oil and gas are capitalized 
we amortize our investment in oil and gas properties using the future gross revenue method 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes have been determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax liability of million which was calculated based on our assumption that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize certain tax attribute carryforwards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the market prices of oil and natural gas  which fluctuate widely 
oil and gas price declines and volatility could adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and profitability 
in order to manage our exposure to oil and gas price declines  we occasionally enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements to secure a price for a portion of our expected future production 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for trading purposes 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions  depending on the hedging instrument used  may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which o our production is less than expected  o there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  o the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform the contracts  or o a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or gas prices 
our hedging policy provides that not more than one half of our production quantities can be hedged without the consent of the board of directors 
additionally  not more than of our production quantities can be committed to hedging agreements regardless of the prices available 
hedging 
during  we realized a net reduction in revenue from our hedging transactions of million 
our contracts totaled  mbbls of oil and  bbtus of gas  which represented approximately and  respectively  of our oil and gas production for the year 
the net reduction in revenue from hedging transactions for was million 
our contracts totaled  mbbls of oil and  bbtus of gas  which represented approximately and  respectively  of our oil and gas production for that year 
at december   the only hedging contracts we had in place were oil puts 
put contracts are not costless  they are purchased at a rate per unit of hedged production that fluctuates with the commodity futures market 
the historical cost of the put contracts represents our maximum cash exposure 
we are not obligated to make any further payments under the put contracts regardless of future commodity price fluctuations 
our oil puts were reflected as assets in our december  balance sheet at a historical cost of million 
under put contracts  monthly payments are made to us if nymex prices fall below the agreed upon floor price  while allowing us to fully participate in commodity prices above that floor 
oil contracts typically settle using the average of the daily closing prices for a calendar month 
since our properties are located in the gulf coast basin  we believe that fluctuations in nymex prices will closely match changes in market prices for our production 
at december   we had hedged oil prices for the applicable periods  quantities and prices as follows puts oil volume cost bbls floor millions the expenditures made in to obtain puts totaled million 
at december   the fair market value of these put contracts was million resulting in an unrealized gain of million 
this gain was not reflected in our financial statements at december  because we did not adopt sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  until january  adoption of sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  under sfas no 
 as amended  the nature of a derivative instrument must be evaluated to determine if it qualifies for special hedge accounting treatment 
if the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment  it would be recorded as either an asset or liability measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the derivative s fair value would be recognized in equity through other comprehensive income  to the extent the hedge is considered effective 
if the derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  it would be recorded in the balance sheet and changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings 
at december   the only derivative instruments we had in place were puts which  to the extent of changes in time value  do not meet the effectiveness criteria for special hedge accounting treatment 
these puts were reflected as assets in our december  balance sheet at a historical cost of million 
at year end  the fair value of our puts was million 
if we had adopted sfas no 
during  we would have marked the puts to market by recording a gain of million in earnings 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the increase in fair value over historical cost of million was recorded as a transition adjustment 
we recorded the gain in equity through other comprehensive income 
as each put contract expires  we will recognize the related portion of the transition adjustment in earnings 
combined hedging 
the following table shows the hedging position of the combined company as of february  puts gas oil volume cost volume cost bbtus floor millions bbls floor millions the hedged volumes related to the gas put contracts are from april december fixed price gas swaps volume bbtus price in addition to put contracts  discussed above  the combined company utilized fixed price swaps to hedge a portion of its future gas production 
the combined company did not enter into hedging transactions for trading purposes 
fixed price swaps typically provide for monthly payments by the combined company if nymex prices rise above the fixed swap price or to the combined company if nymex prices fall below the fixed swap price 
natural gas contracts typically settle using the average closing prices for near month nymex futures contracts for the three days prior to the settlement date 
fixed price swaps meet the effectiveness criteria to qualify for special hedge account treatment under sfas no 
 as amended 
impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on the combined company 
at december   the oil put contracts were recorded in the supplemental combined balance sheet see note supplemental combined financial statements unaudited to the financial statements at a historical cost of million and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect at year end  the fixed price gas swap contracts were not recorded in the supplemental combined balance sheet since they were costless 
the gas put contracts were purchased subsequent to year end and therefore were not recorded in the december  balance sheet 
at december   the fair values of the combined company s oil put contracts and fixed price gas swaps were million and million  respectively 
sfas no 
was adopted on january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  the increase in fair value over historical cost of the combined company s oil put contracts of million was a transition adjustment that was recorded as a gain in equity through other comprehensive income 
in addition  the fair market value of the fixed price gas swaps was recorded in the balance sheet as a liability and the corresponding loss of million was recorded in equity through other comprehensive income 
projected revenue 
based on projected combined annual sales for  a decline in the prices the combined company is projecting to receive for its crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on its annual revenue 
this hypothetical impact of the decline in oil and gas prices is net of the incremental increase in revenue that the combined company would realize  upon a decline in prices  from the oil and gas hedging contracts in place as of february  fair value of financial instruments the fair value of cash and cash equivalents  net accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated book value at december  at december   the fair value of the notes totaled million
