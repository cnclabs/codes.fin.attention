item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december  and january  presented below reflects certain restatements to the corporation s previously reported results of operations for these periods 
see restatement of consolidated financial statements and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these restatements 
recent history over the past few years  thomas betts pursued various strategies and undertook a number of initiatives designed to drive growth 
these strategies and activities delivered short term results  but ultimately created serious performance issues 
the corporation is currently undergoing a major transition in the way it manages and operates its businesses in order to correct these issues and return its performance to acceptable levels on a sustainable basis 
the corporation s two key strategies were broadening its product portfolio through acquisitions and improving margins by moving manufacturing to lower cost areas 
over five years  the corporation completed acquisitions or mergers some of which proved to be non strategic and moved a large number of product lines or facilities to alternative locations  with more than half going to low cost areas such as mexico and hungary 
some of these acquisition and manufacturing activities led thomas betts to record multiple restructuring charges over the past five years 
the management structure of the corporation also negatively impacted the results of its activities 
beginning in and continuing through august  thomas betts managed its businesses along three axes market  product and geographic with functional responsibilities  such as legal  operations  finance and human resources  centralized 
this matrix structure was inherently complex with overlapping responsibilities between functional and operational managers 
this situation greatly diminished accountability and adversely impacted the corporation s ability to execute effectively 
as part of a plan to use technology strategically to manage its businesses  thomas betts began to convert its global financial and order processing information systems beginning in the corporation also committed significant resources to position itself to be a leader in the then emerging business to business bb e commerce market 
the majority of these conversions were completed by december  although certain systems continue to be refined 
thomas betts encountered problems with the implementation of certain of these systems 
notably  difficulties experienced in the start up of the corporation s new global order processing system tops in november resulted in severe disruption to the corporation s business  including shipping errors and delays  invoicing errors  order cancellations  unusual freight expediting and the redirection of significant resources to solve the related technology and business issues 
the combination of the corporation s acquisition  manufacturing and bb e commerce strategies  along with its matrix management structure and the magnitude  timing and execution of the systems conversions  significantly strained the corporation s management resources  hampered effectiveness  and diverted attention away from the day to day operations of the business 
this resulted in a serious deterioration in the quality of thomas betts market performance  customer relations  service  products  and research and development 
in addition  thomas betts strategy in bb e commerce proved unachievable given the dynamics of the electrical industry 
in august  the senior management positions associated with this initiative were eliminated and other associated resources were redirected 
to address the corporation s poor performance  the corporation s board of directors initiated several key management changes 
in march  thomas betts hired john p 
murphy as chief page of financial officer and  in august  t 
kevin dunnigan was elected chairman and chief executive officer 
dunnigan was previously the corporation s chairman and chief executive officer and had spent years with thomas betts before retiring from active management in a detailed study of the key components of working capital was undertaken by the new financial management team with the intent to improve performance in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory management 
this effort led to the discovery of issues with the corporation s accounting and operational practices and the conclusion that significant additional provisions and write downs were required in the aforementioned  and in other areas 
further description of these management reviews is contained below under review of processes  controls and systems 
as a result of the reviews of processes  controls and systems  management recognized that deficiencies existed in a number of the corporation s processes related to accounts receivable 
accordingly  in september  thomas betts retained a nationally recognized firm to assist in eliminating its excessive accounts receivable backlog and to manage its claims and collections function 
concurrently  management has been working to eliminate the underlying technical and business problems that contributed to a high number of customer payment deductions and hampered the effectiveness of the corporation s accounts receivable collections effort 
thomas betts has made good progress in correcting technical systems issues that adversely impacted its pricing and invoicing systems in previous periods 
as a result  the corporation has experienced a decline in the number of deductions taken by its customers in recent months 
management believes that  overall  the accounts receivable situation has been stabilized and is showing improvement 
the corporation s review of processes also led to substantial charges to write down inventory and revealed deficiencies in its inventory management and control processes 
using a combination of internal resources and third party consultants  thomas betts undertook a thorough review of global inventory management and control processes 
this review is progressing on schedule and will be completed early in the second quarter of management believes that it has made substantial progress toward the elimination of the corporation s inventory control issues 
in a similar manner  thomas betts has now initiated a cross functional  cross divisional project to assess and further improve key processes that drive the corporation s relationship with its customers 
the processes being reviewed include pricing  quotations  order entry  ship from stock and debit  returned goods and claims processing 
the lack of comprehensive policies and inadequate procedures in these areas led  over a period of time  to a high number of customer payment deductions 
thomas betts expects to further strengthen its core processes and controls in the areas listed above by late this effort is expected to further improve the corporation s overall operational  accounts receivable and customer service performance 
the new management team intends to operate thomas betts as a tightly managed  decentralized organization with minimal corporate overhead 
accordingly  in august  the corporation eliminated the matrix organizational structure referenced above and replaced it with a fully integrated  market driven  divisional structure 
in the new structure  each business president is responsible  and accountable  for all manufacturing  engineering  marketing  business development and associated support activities for his or her business 
business unit managers are also responsible for managing working capital  with the support and guidance of corporate resources 
to support the effectiveness of these changes  the corporation s management incentive program has been significantly revised for further improving working capital is now a key performance metric for the incentive compensation program and accounts for approximately of the target goal 
effectively implementing an organizational change of this magnitude involves many individuals and processes 
although the corporation is well under way in this effort  it expects to continue to refine its page of management structure and strengthen the quality of its leadership team as business and financial processes are changed to improve operating efficiency 
enhancing the training  quality and succession planning of management at all levels of the corporation will continue to be a key focus of thomas betts 
thomas betts has also taken action to address the unsatisfactory management and performance of its largest business  electrical products sold through distributors 
in october  dominic j 
pileggi  a former thomas betts executive who had left the corporation in  was hired to lead the electrical business 
over the past three months  mr 
pileggi has reorganized and strengthened the leadership and internal processes of this business 
specifically  the product management and sales organizations of the electrical business commercial and industrial product groups have been fully combined  eliminating managerial redundancies and affording the opportunity to reduce the number of sales offices by over 
as a result  the sales and sales support staff has been significantly reduced 
management has also revised the electrical business sales compensation program  effective january  to include both revenue growth and product mix 
previously  the electrical business sales compensation program was based entirely on sales volume 
the business is also rationalizing its use of outside sales agencies to ensure an appropriate balance between direct sales and agency representatives in each geographic region  with a focus on pull through rather than push through selling techniques 
in addition to realigning the sales organization  the corporation s electrical business is redirecting the product management function back to managing the full complement of brand management activities ie pricing  sales  manufacturing and new product development 
thomas betts has many well known  leading brands in its product portfolio 
over the past few years  however  product managers primarily focused on reducing product costs rather than strengthening these brands with the end users of its products electricians  contractors and mro maintenance  repair and operations accounts 
late in the first quarter of  new management with significant industry and functional experience joined thomas betts to lead the electrical business product management effort 
the corporation is also rebuilding its engineering capabilities and expanding its focus on developing new products that lower the cost of installation for its end user customers 
the electrical business expects to steadily increase research and development r d spending to levels in line with industry standards and to increase the percent of sales generated by new products over the next few years 
savings achieved through improvements in operating efficiencies are expected to be partially offset by the increase in r d spending 
thomas betts electrical business operates in highly competitive markets 
the corporation stocks approximately  products and has relationships with more than  electrical and utility distributors  retail outlets and mass merchandisers 
like many of its industry peers  the corporation uses a variety of promotional programs  including volume incentive discount programs  to compete effectively 
in addition to these broad scale  price based promotional programs  the electrical sales personnel had the authority to offer price concessions on a per product  per customer basis for the past several years 
ultimately  the combination of these factors lead to an unmanageable degree of pricing complexity  which inevitably gave rise to the many customer invoice disputes as discussed earlier 
thomas betts is now in the process of comprehensively revising and simplifying its policies and procedures related to pricing 
the authority to set prices has been re established as a fundamental responsibility of the product management function and sales personnel no longer have the authority to modify prices or give concessions 
customer incentive programs have been simplified and controls are being enhanced to ensure compliance with the corporation s new pricing directives 
page of previously  the electrical business regularly used quarterly promotions based on deep price discounts and favorable terms as a key tactic 
these tactics compromised the corporation s ability to estimate market demand for key products 
thomas betts has discontinued its use of this type of promotional program 
marketing resources have now been redirected to enhance the electrical business ability to accurately forecast demand for its products 
over time  the discounting programs discussed above led to an excessive amount of inventory in the corporation s key distribution channel electrical distributors  dampening demand and putting pressure on industry wide pricing 
compounding the inventory problem for the corporation  was its matrix management structure  which did not efficiently match production with demand  creating excess inventory within the corporation s facilities 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the corporation took back a high level of physical product returns related to the corporation s former quarterly promotional programs  further contributing to its high inventory levels 
to compensate  thomas betts has  and continues to  rationalize production at some of its manufacturing facilities 
as a result  the corporation is experiencing higher than normal unabsorbed fixed costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances  a situation that is expected to continue until appropriate inventory levels are restored 
across all of its businesses  thomas betts is focused on reducing expenses  with a corporate goal of reducing selling  general and administrative expenses to less than of sales by the end of each of the corporation s businesses has outlined  and begun implementing  initiatives to lower manufacturing costs 
in certain cases  production is being consolidated 
this effort  coupled with the corporation s decision to discontinue several product lines that were not achieving acceptable returns  necessitated shutting down certain manufacturing lines 
unusually high freight and distribution costs have also adversely affected thomas betts performance 
management has taken significant initial steps to reduce freight costs  including consolidating customer shipments and revising freight policies incorporated in promotional programs such as its signature service sm preferred customer program 
thomas betts expects to see gradual improvement in freight performance beginning in the second half of thomas betts believes that it has identified  and made substantial progress in addressing  the majority of the issues that have adversely impacted its performance over the past several years 
the corporation s shift to a divisional management structure and its focus on strengthening the quality of the management team have contributed significantly to the development of a comprehensive long term plan to restore thomas betts to a profitable and strategically focused leadership position in its markets 
the corporation will continue to execute against this plan throughout the remainder of and into new management team during  the corporation experienced significant management changes 
in august  t 
kevin dunnigan was elected chairman and chief executive officer by the board of directors 
mr 
dunnigan had previously served as the corporation s chairman from to may and as the corporation s chief executive officer from to the corporation elected john p 
murphy as senior vice president and chief financial officer and connie c 
muscarella as vice president human resources and administration in march  kenneth w 
fluke as vice president controller in september and dominic j 
pileggi as senior vice president and group president electrical in october the corporation also appointed mark a 
bender as director of audit services in january page of review of processes  controls and systems during the corporation s new management team began a comprehensive review of processes  controls and systems in order to ensure their adequacy and  when appropriate  began implementing improvements 
staffing improvements were identified as being required and the corporate accounting group was strengthened as was the divisional controllership group and internal audit 
the process of strengthening the accounting staff throughout the organization will continue throughout the coming year 
the corporation has simplified its management reporting in conjunction with the elimination of its previous matrix based management structure 
the matrix structure involved extensive financial allocations to support desired management reporting and contributed to confusion as to certain business and accounting responsibilities 
management expects the new divisional based structure to enhance visibility and accountability 
early in this review  the accounts receivable function was identified as being in need of significant improvement 
accordingly  the corporation retained a nationally recognized firm to manage its claims and collections functions at least until such time as the backlog of claims is eliminated and management has established appropriate internal processes to ensure the corporation can remain current in managing its collections efforts 
the corporation has also made progress in correcting technical systems issues that adversely impacted its pricing and invoicing systems during the fourth quarter of and the first half of these systems problems were responsible  in part  for the large number of payment deductions made by customers and associated problems that hampered the corporation s accounts receivable collection efforts 
the corporation began a program to analyze and correct deficiencies in its inventory management and control processes 
using a combination of internal resources and third party consultants  the corporation completed a thorough review of inventory controls and processes 
the corporation is now refining and implementing new control procedures over inventory accounting 
management currently expects to have the new inventory procedures in place near the beginning of the second quarter of the corporation began a program in the first quarter of to analyze its revenue cycle pricing quotations  order entry  ship from stock and debit  returned goods  and claims processing processes 
using a combination of internal resources and third party consultants  the corporation expects to complete its review and begin to implement any enhancements necessary by late the corporation is reviewing its existing capital appropriations management processes to enhance controls associated with authorization and procurement 
management began implementing enhancements during the first quarter of the corporation has eliminated previous promotional programs based on steep price discounting and is in the process of comprehensively revising and simplifying its pricing policies 
as part of this change  field sales personnel no longer have the authority to set prices or offer price concessions 
the corporation also revised the incentives offered in its signature service preferred customer program to ensure that the program supports profitable sales  and established tighter guidelines and accounting controls for volume related discount programs and other price rebates effective in to address the corporation s high freight costs  primarily as a result of inefficiencies and overly generous shipping policies  the new management team is revising the corporation s freight policies to make them comparable to  and competitive with  the corporation s electrical components industry peers 
as part of this effort  the corporation began in the third quarter of to consolidate shipments to customers in several key regional markets 
consolidating customer shipments reduces costs and simplifies the customer s receipt of materials 
management believes that it will have revised page of freight policies and procedures in place in the second quarter of  and expects to see gradual improvements in its freight performance for the second half of the corporation is also exploring alternatives to make its distribution and warehouse operations more cost effective 
distribution costs are high due to inefficiencies and excess warehouse capacity 
improvements in all of the areas discussed above will require time to refine and fully implement  while other areas continue to undergo review 
until these reviews are completed  and improvements fully implemented and refined  the corporation s results of operations and financial position may continue to be impacted by the corporation s existing business practices  processes  systems and controls 
restatement of consolidated financial statements as a result of the reviews described above  management identified primarily in the second quarter of  certain prior period adjustments which necessitated a restatement of the corporation s consolidated financial statements for the first and second quarters of  the interim periods of  and for the years   and pretax amounts initially recorded in for continuing operations totaling approximately million approximately million on an after tax basis have been eliminated from continuing operations in and have been reflected as a restatement of earlier periods

additionally  pretax amounts totaling approximately million initially reflected in the corporation s financial results for  and which were deemed immaterial to the previously reported results of those earlier periods  have been eliminated from discontinued operations in that period and have been reflected as a restatement of earlier periods 
the principal adjustments  as well as the periods affected  are in the following categories page of restatement attribution a in thousands prior periods continuing operations net sales revenue recognition   other revenue adjustments     pretax earnings loss revenue recognition   other revenue adjustments     property  plant and equipment    other     income tax effect and adjustments    net earnings loss     earnings loss from discontinued operations  net total earnings loss from continuing and discontinued operations a the attribution represents increases decreases in the applicable financial statement captions and includes the restatement of certain items initially recorded in and the restatement of charges initially reflected in the third quarter  which were deemed immaterial at that time 
the principal restatement adjustments to thomas betts consolidated financial statements are summarized as follows revenue recognition the restated consolidated financial statements reflect the reversal of incorrectly recorded revenue from special promotional programs targeted at a select group of the corporation s largest volume accounts  the terms of which caused the transactions to fail to qualify for immediate recognition 
other revenue adjustments the restated consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments to net sales to properly accrue for returns  allowances  shipping and pricing errors  and volume and price rebates 
property  plant and equipment the restated consolidated financial statements reflect adjustments to depreciate assets misclassified as construction in progress and to recognize depreciation expense in the appropriate periods 
adjustments were also made to correctly reflect certain items as period expenses that were previously capitalized 
other other items reflected in the restated consolidated financial statements are primarily adjustments to properly attribute freight costs and restructuring charges 
page of income tax adjustments income tax adjustments primarily reflect the tax impact of the pretax adjustments described above 
discontinued operations on july   the corporation completed the sale of substantially all of its previous electronics oem business for million  subject to certain adjustments 
the electronics oem sale has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accordingly  results from continuing operations for the current and prior periods exclude the impact of the electronics oem business 
the net results for the current and prior periods of the electronics oem business are reflected in earnings from  or gain on the sale of  discontinued operations 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reclassifications during  the corporation began reporting expenses for transportation of products to customers and between its facilities as a component of cost of sales as a result of the adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
these costs had previously been reported as a reduction of net sales 
the financial statements for prior years were reclassified to conform to the presentation 
those reclassifications had no effect on earnings or loss in any year 
year compared with consolidated results net sales the corporation s net sales decreased million from the prior year  reflecting reduced sales volume in its electrical segment 
the reduced electrical sales volumes were due to a number of factors including disruptions caused by the corporation s implementation of a new pricing and order processing system in late  including a decline in demand associated with customer discontent with the corporation s impaired ability to accurately process orders and at times from disruptions in the corporation s ability to fulfill orders on a timely basis 
a decrease in traditional electrical quarter end promotional sales incentives that in the prior year resulted in significantly larger sales volumes at discounted sales prices 
certain excess inventories in the electrical distribution channel as a result of prior promotional practices no longer utilized by the corporation 
sales for were also negatively impacted by the divestitures of product lines in the communications segment 
the corporation sold the photon and broadband product lines in june and september  respectively  which had combined sales in of approximately million prior to their divestiture 
in  the corporation sold the telzon hddx and aster product lines in march and november  respectively 
the combined adverse net sales impact from the divested product lines when compared to is approximately million 
in  net sales were negatively impacted by increased accounts receivable provisions which were necessitated largely by the confusion and disruption caused by the corporation s implementation of new financial  pricing and order processing systems 
after completion of the implementation of the new order processing computer systems in late  the corporation experienced significant disruptions  page of which led to the corporation s inability to execute an effective collections process because of considerable uncertainty with customer billing 
the latter led to many customer payment deductions and an increase in aged receivables 
gross margin the gross margin percent for the year was of sales compared with in the significantly lower gross margin in year reflects the following lower sales volume primarily in the electrical segment partially due to the decrease in use of traditional promotional sales incentive programs  and the distribution channel for the corporation s products containing high levels of thomas betts product 
see net sales discussion above 
increases in accounts receivable provisions 
see net sales discussion above 
lower net pricing primarily in the electrical segment due to excessive use of discounting  price and volume rebates and customer concessions 
higher manufacturing costs due to lower capacity utilization 
the corporation significantly cut back production in the second half of  when it became apparent the distribution channel for its products was full and it already had sufficient inventory in its own facilities 
increased freight costs approximately million due partially to unusual freight expediting practices 
increased write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory 
the corporation recorded a write down of approximately million for excess and obsolete inventory based on management s evaluation of current inventory aging and usage and its new strategy to reduce levels of slow moving inventory 
the corporation also recorded an additional write down of approximately million for specifically identifiable slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory primarily attributable to divested product lines 
further inventory write downs totaling approximately million related to product lines considered to be non strategic at year end and therefore expected to be sold or disposed of 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of sales in  versus in the significant increases were primarily in legal  auditing and accounting fees and expenses approximately million 
the increase reflects expenses related to ongoing litigation and investigation of the corporation s accounting practices by the securities and exchange commission  efforts to improve our current business and accounting processes and controls  our enhanced collections process for outstanding accounts receivable  and audit fees relating to the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for through information technology expenses approximately million 
the increase reflects our efforts to stabilize and enhance our existing global order processing  finance  and human resources systems  as well as support our decision to abandon certain bb e commerce initiatives including writing off certain software 
distribution expenses approximately million 
page of the increase reflects inefficiencies in our warehousing operations as well as expenses for third party warehousing capacity 
corporate severance expense approximately million 
sg a expense was also high due in part to overhead levels which remained following the sale of the corporation s electronics oem business in the second quarter of management has taken steps in to reduce these overhead levels substantially for research and development research and development expense represented and of sales for years and  respectively 
the corporation expects research and development expense to increase in dollar terms during amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was of sales for both years and a majority of the amortization is related to goodwill recorded as part of the corporation s american electric and amerace acquisitions 
impairment charges on long lived assets subsequent to its decision to sell the electronics oem business  the corporation s management re evaluated the strategic importance of a number of product lines and concluded that it will dispose of some of those product lines by sale or otherwise 
the corporation has considered net cash flows  including the expected proceeds from the sale of assets of those product lines  and as a result has recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during impairment charges totaled approximately million for the electrical segment primarily die cast fittings  circuit protection  electrical enclosures product lines and totaled approximately million for the communications segment primarily premise wiring product line

page of income from unconsolidated companies income from unconsolidated companies includes equity income from the corporation s joint ventures and other equity investments 
year reflects lower equity income from its investment in leviton manufacturing co 
as compared to interest expense net interest expense net includes interest income of million in and million in the increase in interest income is due primarily to increased earnings on a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the electronics oem business 
gross interest expense attributable to continuing operations in increased from the prior year in part due to higher interest rates on floating rate debt experienced in the current year 
resulting net interest expense in remained relatively flat compared with the prior year 
other expense income net other expense income net for reflects million in income generated from the settlement of a trade secret and trade dress infringement lawsuit  which was partially offset by losses on sale of receivables pursuant to an asset securitization program that was terminated during  and losses on sales of certain fixed assets 
in  the corporation generated income of million as a result of a termination fee related to a proposed acquisition that more than offset related transaction costs and losses on sale of receivables under the corporation s asset securitization program

earnings loss for the electrical segment decreased million from the prior year 
communications segment earnings loss decreased million from the prior year  and earnings loss related to all other decreased million from the prior year 
electrical sales for the electrical segment decreased in  to billion 
sales during reflect the negative impact of an increase in the historical level of receivable provisions combined with the negative impact during the last half of the year of a decrease in traditional electrical quarter end promotional sales incentives that in the prior year resulted in significantly larger volumes at discounted sales prices 
additionally  these prior promotional sales incentives resulted in excessive inventory in the distributor channel during sales for the electrical segment were positively impacted by the acquisitions of shamrock conduit products  inc and l 
e 
mason co 
in late communications sales for the communications segment decreased in  to million 
sales were negatively impacted when the corporation sold the photon and broadband product lines in june and september  respectively  which had combined sales in of approximately million prior to page of their divestiture 
in the year  the corporation sold the telzon hddx and aster product lines in march and november  respectively 
the combined adverse net sales impact from the divested product lines when compared to is approximately million 
other sales from business activities that cannot be classified in the aforementioned two segments totaled million in  million more than in year compared with the corporation had net sales in of billion  higher than in which was primarily the result of acquisitions listed below in late and during three significant factors affect the comparability of sales during the reporting period 
in november  the corporation acquired kaufel group ltd 
kaufel  a manufacturer and marketer of emergency and other lighting products 
in its first full year  kaufel contributed million to sales  an increase of million over its contribution 
in september  the corporation divested itself of three cable television amplifier businesses with sales for nine months of totaling million 
results for also include the contributions of three acquisitions 
the corporation acquired ocal  inc ocal in january and shamrock conduit products  inc shamrock in september both of those acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and their results are included from the date that thomas betts acquired each company 
additionally  thomas betts acquired l 
e 
mason co 
mason in august and accounted for that transaction as an immaterial pooling of interests 
the three acquisitions accounted for million of sales 
for  non us sales accounted for of the corporation s total sales compared with in sales outside the us have increased due to acquisitions of companies with non us sales and the corporation s efforts to increase foreign sales 
sales of the electrical segment grew in  to billion 
sales from kaufel were the largest driver of the segment s sales growth in acquisitions contributed all of the segment s growth  more than offsetting slight volume declines in sales to industrial markets and commercial construction customers that were due  in part  to sales losses or deferrals resulting from installation of a new order management system 
communications segment sales of million were higher in compared with in s third quarter  the corporation completed sales of its cable amplifier product lines to sharpen its focus within the cable television business on its core hardware product lines 
these product lines had sales of million and generated a pretax loss of million on those sales 
those same businesses had sales of million in sales from business activities that cannot be classified in the aforementioned two segments totaled million in  lower than in expenses for included charges related to a program to reduce costs through manufacturing relocations 
the charges were recorded as million of cost of sales  million for impairment of long lived assets and a million provision for restructured operations 
in many cases individual factories involved in the cost reduction effort manufactured product lines for more than one of the corporation s reportable segments  and these costs were therefore excluded from the measurement of segment results 
page of the consolidated gross margin percent was of sales compared with in the lower gross margin percent in compared with earlier years resulted from the loss of gross margin due to charges  primarily to write down inventory and recognize promotional sales discounts  recorded following implementation of the new financial systems described elsewhere and to thomas betts order processing system tops implementation issues 
sg a expense was of sales in  versus in sg a rose as a percent of sales compared with earlier years due primarily to the charges recorded following implementation of the new financial systems and additional expense associated with the tops implementation 
thomas betts spent of sales on research and development r d in  compared with in amortization expense rose in both and compared with the respective prior year due to additional amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions 
certain restructure and special charge accruals established in were reduced in  primarily because of decisions not to execute all of the originally planned phases of certain projects for economic reasons 
income from unconsolidated companies includes equity income from the corporation s joint ventures and other equity investments  including investments in leviton manufacturing co 
and the elastimold offshore joint ventures 
interest expense net includes interest income of million in and million in gross interest expense attributable to continuing operations in increased from the prior year primarily due to higher outstanding debt and higher interest rates on floating rate debt experienced in resulting net interest expense in increased compared with the prior year 
other expense income net includes losses on sales of accounts receivable pursuant to a receivables securitization program and foreign currency losses or gains partially offset by foreign exchange contract gains and other income 
the corporation generated income of million in as a result of a termination fee related to a proposed acquisition that more than offset related transaction costs and losses on sales of accounts receivable 
the effective income tax rate for includes a million reduction in the tax provision from approval of tax refund claims and completion of prior year audits 
that reduction resulted in a tax benefit of for the effective income tax rate for was 
the corporation evaluates its business segments on the basis of segment earnings loss  with segment earnings loss defined as earnings loss from continuing operations before interest  taxes  restructure and certain other expenses 
the magnitude of charges and credits recorded following the financial systems conversion as well as the impact of the tops implementation heavily impacted the operating results of all segments and the comparability of those results to results of prior years 
earnings loss of the electrical segment decreased in from s level 
communications segment earnings declined in from  with the majority of the decrease attributable to losses generated by amplifier product lines divested by the corporation in earnings loss related to all other rose in compared with  as a result of enhancements made in the manufacturing processes for steel structures and heating units 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities operating activities used cash of million in this compares to cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in working capital excluding net assets of discontinued operations as of december  was million compared with page of million as of january  the corporation s receivables were impacted by the purchase during of million of receivables previously sold under the corporation s asset securitization program 
the corporation s inventory levels as of year end were million lower than at year end  due primarily to inventory write downs and lower production levels 
investing activities capital expenditures for totaled million  which was million less than  as expected  due to planned lower expenditures for capital expenditures of approximately million are planned for year the corporation purchased one product line for million in  and received million in from the sale of other product lines 
the corporation received million in from the sale of product lines 
on july   the corporation completed the sale of substantially all of its previous electronics oem business for million  subject to certain adjustments 
thomas betts completed three acquisitions during for approximately million of cash   shares of the corporation s common stock and million of assumed debt 
those acquisitions were in january  ocal  a manufacturer of pvc coated conduit bodies  in august  mason  a manufacturer of weatherproof electrical boxes and covers  conduit bodies  fittings and residential outdoor lighting  and in september  shamrock  a manufacturer of steel and aluminum conduit elbows  couplings and conduit nipples used by electrical contractors 
the ocal and shamrock acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and together gave rise to million of goodwill 
the mason acquisition was accounted for as an immaterial pooling of interests 
thomas betts completed eight acquisitions during for approximately million of cash and approximately million of assumed debt 
one of those acquisitions was of significant size kaufel  a manufacturer of emergency and other lighting products 
all acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method  and in aggregate  gave rise to million of goodwill 
acquisitions accounted for as purchases in represented million of that year s sales 
financing activities the electronics oem sale in the second quarter of produced proceeds of million 
these proceeds were subsequently used to pay down domestic debt of approximately million and international debt of approximately million  including senior debentures due issued by one of the corporation s canadian subsidiaries 
the remainder of the proceeds was used for short term investment and other operating purposes 
during  the corporation purchased a total of million of receivables sold under the corporation s previous asset securitization program 
due to limitations imposed under this program  the corporation using its debt facilities purchased million of receivables prior to june which were sold under this program 
additionally  immediately prior to the electronics oem sale  the corporation purchased using its debt facilities the remaining million of receivables sold under this program 
total dividends paid to shareholders were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
year end debt decreased million in compared with  primarily reflecting the debt reduction resulting from the partial usage of the electronics oem sale proceeds 
total debt increased million in compared to  reflecting debt issued and assumed for acquisitions and to fund increases in working capital 
the corporation maintains a commercial paper program  which is backed by million of revolving credit agreements 
at year end  no commercial paper was page of outstanding 
the revolving credit agreements include million in commitments from two groups of banks  under which million is available through june and million is available through june under the latter commitment  any borrowings outstanding as of june would mature on june under such facilities  the corporation has the option of selecting an interest rate  at the time of borrowing  based on a number of benchmarks including libor  certificate of deposit rate or the prime lending rate of the agent bank 
management believes that its external financial resources and internally generated funds are sufficient to meet the corporation s capital needs for the foreseeable future 
during  the corporation reduced the aggregate commitment under the revolving credit agreements from million to million and amended certain covenant provisions  fees and rates contained in the credit agreements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments thomas betts is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  raw material commodity prices and interest rates 
the corporation may enter into various hedging transactions to reduce those risks and allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
the corporation does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions or commodity price contracts for speculative purposes 
foreign exchange risk thomas betts primarily enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the impact on earnings and cash flow from non functional currency denominated assets  liabilities and transactions  predominately intercompany and third party receivables and payables 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the losses or gains on the underlying assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
the corporation s forward foreign exchange contracts generally have maturity dates of less than days  and the corporation maintains a high correlation between the hedges and the underlying assets  liabilities or transactions to minimize currency risk 
in most cases  both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are marked to market monthly with gains and losses included in earnings as other income or expense 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currencies  with the resulting functional currency gains and losses translated into us dollars at the spot rate  the loss in fair value of exchange contracts held on december   would have been million 
those losses would be substantially offset by gains on the underlying assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
interest rate risk as of december   the fair value of the corporation s long term debt including current maturities  estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the corporation s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements  was million 
that fair value was million lower than the carrying value of debt at december  the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates amounted to million at december  commodity risk thomas betts is exposed to risk from fluctuations in prices for commodities used to manufacture its products  primarily copper  zinc and aluminum 
some of that risk is hedged through the use of futures contracts that fix the price the corporation will pay for the commodity 
the use of such commodity contracts effectively protects thomas betts against changes in the price of the commodity to the extent of the notional amount under the contract 
since the maturities of those page of contracts are highly correlated with the actual purchases of the commodities  the reported cost of sales amounts reflect the commodities costs  including the effects of commodity hedges 
as of december   the net unrealized loss on all commodity contracts held was million 
a hypothetical decrease in all commodity market prices would increase that unrealized loss to million 
the corporation would normally only record those losses at the time the commodity is actually purchased  and the loss would be reported as a part of cost of sales 
new accounting statements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activity  an amendment of sfas sfas no 
and sfas no 
require the recognition at fair value of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
under certain conditions  a derivative can be designated as a hedge allowing the deferral of fair value gains or losses until the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged item are recognized 
at times thomas betts enters into derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange and commodity fluctuations 
the corporation does not expect its existing derivative instruments as of december  to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the new provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 and will therefore be required to apply mark to market accounting for these derivative instruments during sfas no

financial condition and results of operations outlook based on preliminary information to date for the first fiscal quarter of  the corporation s level of net sales and resulting profitability for that period will be below the comparable period in the prior year 
in addition  the corporation anticipates an increase in net debt total debt net of all cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared with december  due in part to the payment of million in executive severance that was accrued as of december  barring any unforeseen change in the general economy  management expects to move toward its goal of achieving a revenue and earnings growth profile in line with the corporation s industry peers in the second half of and into cash flow from operations is targeted to be positive in page of
