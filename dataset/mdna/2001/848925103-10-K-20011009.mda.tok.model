such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  the actual plan of operations  business strategy  operating results and financial position of sport haley could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  such forward looking statements 
sport haley s business in general is subject to certain risks including the following o the demand for sport haley s products may decrease if the popularity of golf decreases or if other factors  such as a slowing economy or inclement weather  cause golfers not to patronize golf professional shops 
o sport haley must continue to design apparel that is accepted by consumers as fashionable and stylish in order to continue to have market acceptance 
o sport haley s sales are seasonal  and historically sales from july through december  sport haley s first and second fiscal quarters  are weaker than sales from january through june  which are sport haley s third and fourth fiscal quarters 
o the market for golf apparel is extremely competitive  price competition or industry consolidation could weaken sport haley s competitive position 
o sport haley maintains a significant level of finished goods inventories to support its sales volume and its corporate apparel program 
disposal of excess prior seasons inventory is an ongoing part of operations  but a significant amount of sales at the lower margins dictated by inventory reduction may impair sport haley s financial condition 
inventory write downs may also affect its financial condition 
o sport haley depends on timely delivery of finished garments from its suppliers 
the loss of certain suppliers  and or delays in receiving garments from suppliers caused by various factors  including labor shortages and transportation difficulties  could adversely affect sport haley s ability to make timely delivery of finished garments to its customers 
o sport haley s increased reliance on foreign suppliers amplified the risk that sport haley s revenues might be adversely affected if a foreign shipment were lost 
sport haley maintains insurance for risk of loss relating to goods shipped from its foreign and domestic suppliers 
however  the increased reliance on foreign suppliers increases the risk that sport haley would be left with inadequate or unsatisfactory recourse should the goods received from the foreign suppliers be nonconforming 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from sport haley s statements of income for fiscal and and as previously restated for fiscal years and fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of fixed assets income from operations other income and expenses  net income from operations before provision for income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for the year ended june  fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
the decrease is attributable to several factors 
both a general slowing of the economy and unusually inclement weather conditions in major geographic markets were contributing factors to the decrease in net sales 
each of those circumstances contributed to late season cancellations of customer orders for spring season merchandise and a decrease in the number of golf shops that placed orders for basic goods at the opening of the spring golf season 
the net decrease in sales is also consistent with the similar negative trend with respect to the number of rounds of golf played at country club and resort courses 
per published reports  the number of rounds played during fiscal were markedly less than were played during fiscal further  intense competition within the golf apparel industry has continued throughout fiscal companies with greater financial resources and better name recognition than sport haley  such as nike  have continued to intensify their individual marketing efforts within the golf apparel industry 
because of the increased competition with big name companies  sport haley  through its network of independent sales representatives  implemented marketing strategies to attract new customers to the haley r brand and to strengthen relationships with its long time customers 
for fiscal  the men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering  shipping and sales at the retail factory outlet store  which sport haley used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
for fiscal  the men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering  shipping and sales at the retail factory outlet store 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately million in fiscal while the decrease in gross profit is consistent with the downward trend in net sales  the decrease is not entirely due to such a downward trend 
sport haley dramatically altered its business operations during fiscal in order to place the company in a better competitive position within the golf apparel industry 
prior to fiscal  sport haley primarily manufactured its finished goods inventories predominantly by utilizing united states vendors 
during fiscal  sport haley evolved from a company that manufactured its finished goods inventories into a company that primarily purchases its inventories from foreign suppliers 
because of the completion of its change in operations at or near june   sport haley incurred one time charges to cost of goods sold of approximately  during the fiscal quarter ended june  of the  raw materials inventories were deduced by approximately  to reduce the value of those inventories to estimated amounts realizable upon disposal sales of the fabric and trim items 
this revaluation of raw materials inventories directly related to the company s exit from the garment manufacturing industry as of june  the balance of the  consisted of a charge of approximately  to reduce the valuation of prior seasons finished goods inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management expects that their decisions to exit from the garment manufacturing industry and to rely heavily on foreign suppliers for finished goods inventory purchases will help sport haley achieve higher gross margins in future reporting periods 
gross margin for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  from approximately in fiscal as discussed above  gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal due to cost of goods sold inventory write down adjustments of approximately  had the cost of goods sold inventory write down adjustments not been taken  gross margin would have been higher in fiscal than the margin achieved in fiscal in both fiscal and fiscal  gross margins were negatively impacted by dispositions of excess and prior seasons inventories closeout inventories at discounted sales prices 
disposition of closeout inventories is common and recurring within the seasonal apparel business in general 
sales of closeout inventories represented approximately of sport haley s net sales in both fiscal and fiscal and generated approximately million in operating cash from the reduction of inventories in each of the fiscal years 
because of dramatic changes in business operations that include purchasing finished goods inventories from foreign suppliers  the company expects to achieve higher gross margins in fiscal and beyond than were achieved in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately million  an increase of approximately million or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal a significant portion of the increase was attributable to additional accounting  legal and other expenses of approximately  incurred in fiscal related to the restating of the company s financial statements for fiscal years and and the correction of material quarterly information for the quarters of fiscal years  and another portion of the increase was related to increased design costs 
sport haley retained the services of donald w 
jewell during fiscal to redesign and re source the men s apparel collections and to design and source apparel to be included in the ben hogan r apparel collections 
sales commissions expense also attributed approximately  to the increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
commissions increased primarily because of the differences between fiscal years and in the sales prices of current seasons sales 
other contributing factors to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were increased general and health insurance premiums  increased costs of shipping materials and the increased cost of natural gas and electricity utilities 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
in august  the company formalized its decision to close its subsidiary 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sport haley recorded a charge of approximately  related to an impairment of fixed assets 
the impairment related to fixed assets used by the subsidiary in its manufacturing operations 
because of the significant increase in reliance on purchasing finished and packaged apparel from foreign suppliers  sport haley closed the subsidiary in august since that time  substantially all of the subsidiary s assets have been sold at public auction 
future costs associated with the closure of the subsidiary  such as costs of transporting raw fabrics and trim to other locations  freight costs associated with transporting certain fixed assets to the denver facility and future rent  utilities and other costs associated with the four oaks facility  cannot be reasonably quantified at this time 
the subsidiary leases its facilities from two of the subsidiary s former minority shareholders with future minimum lease payments totalling approximately  remaining 
since the subsidiary s lease is not guaranteed by sport haley  management believes that the company may be able to terminate this lease without a material effect on the company s results of operations 
however  no assurance can be given that a material effect will not occur 
total other income  net  for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between fiscal years and in refunds of state income taxes and interest on the refunds relating to certain expenditures recorded in prior years 
income loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal income loss from continuing operations for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the disparity between the decrease in income loss from operations before provision for income taxes and the decrease in income loss from operations arose because of the difference in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the recording of certain transactions for financial statement versus tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the disparity was primarily caused by differences in recording net operating loss carrybacks 
federal income tax law requires a recalculation of the net operating loss created in fiscal  because the loss will be carried back to a tax year in which the company did not file a consolidated tax return 
state income tax law requires that the operating loss be carried forward 
the company recorded an increase in income taxes receivable of approximately  relating to the fiscal loss from continuing operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared with for fiscal net income loss for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the combination of the factors discussed above combined with the approximate  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that was reported for fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for the year ended june  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
the decrease was attributable to several factors 
prior to june   competition within the golf apparel industry increased significantly due mainly to several well known companies with strong financial resources which entered the sportswear market 
these companies name recognitions allowed them to market golf apparel effectively in the retail and catalog markets  which  in turn  adversely impacted sales of golf apparel in the club and resort markets  where the company has primarily operated 
increased competition in the sportswear market significantly increased competition among the companies competing in the resort and club market 
the increased competition resulted in downward sales price pressures in the resort and club markets  which contributed to the downward trend in the company s net sales 
the company experienced a significant increase in the backlog of customer orders near the end of fiscal the increase in backlog orders was primarily attributable to the combination of the inability of several suppliers to timely deliver component materials to the subsidiary and the inability of two suppliers to timely deliver apparel as finished goods to the company s distribution facility 
as a result  the company lost approximately million in gross sales due to the combination of late shipments and canceled customer orders at the end of fiscal the company sells fashion garments in multiple groups consisting of mixes of items manufactured either by the subsidiary or other finished goods suppliers 
because customers order apparel by specific fashion groups and the company is dependent upon more than one supplier to deliver garments in any one fashion group  it is impossible to quantify how the inability of any individual supplier to deliver goods on a timely basis directly relates to the loss of sales due to the late shipment to or canceled orders by any one customer 
in order to mitigate the non timely shipment and cancellation of customer orders  the company implemented controls to monitor its subsidiary and suppliers to ensure more timely receipt of component materials and apparel as finished goods inventories 
specific controls included terminating business relationships with poorly performing suppliers  increasing the total number of suppliers used and establishing business relationships with a greater number of offshore suppliers 
adding suppliers was expected to minimize the detrimental effect of late delivery by one or more suppliers  although there was no assurance of that result 
the increased use of offshore suppliers was expected to increase gross margins achieved in future periods 
for fiscal  the men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering  shipping and sales at the retail factory outlet store  which sport haley used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
for fiscal  the men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales  and the headwear line accounted for approximately 
the remaining of net sales was comprised of embroidering  shipping and sales at the retail factory outlet store 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million or  as compared with approximately million in fiscal the decrease was consistent with the corresponding decline in net sales in fiscal gross margin for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  from approximately in fiscal the decrease was chiefly attributable to proportionately higher incentive sales discounts offered in fiscal as compared with fiscal in both fiscal and  gross margins were negatively impacted by dispositions of excess and prior seasons inventories at discounted sales prices 
disposition of closeout inventories were common within the seasonal apparel business in general 
an increase in closeout inventories was indicative of increased competition within the club and resort markets and other factors 
sales of closeout inventories accounted for approximately of net sales in both fiscal and by comparison  in fiscal  sales of closeout inventories accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company estimated that sales of closeout inventories at reduced sales prices negatively impacted gross margins by approximately in both fiscal and  as compared with the gross margin achieved in fiscal however  the company generated approximately million in operating cash from the reduction of inventories in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately million  a reduction of approximately  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal selling expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in sales commissions corresponding to a decreased sales volume 
sales commissions for fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sales commissions were approximately for both fiscal and the company implemented certain cost containment measures during fiscal that were specifically designed to reduce general and administrative expenses 
other than advertising expenses  which increased by approximately due to increased marketing efforts  general and administrative costs generally decreased for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  primarily because of a reduction in the number of employees of the company 
salaries and related payroll taxes for fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal while total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal as compared with fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal  as compared with fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal were approximately  an increase of approximately  as compared with for fiscal the increase was mainly attributable to lower net sales in fiscal over which fixed costs were allocated 
total other income for fiscal was approximately  an increase of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to refunds of state income taxes and interest earned on the refunds relating to certain expenditures in prior years 
income from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal was approximately  an increase of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the disparity between the decrease in income from operations before provision for income taxes and the increase in income from continuing operations arose because of the difference in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to income tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the recording of certain transactions for financial statement versus tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be expensed for financial statement purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the disparity was primarily caused by differences in the recording of transactions relating to accounting for the equity interest in the loss of the subsidiary that was not consolidated for tax purposes in fiscal and changes in deferred tax valuation allowances related to the subsidiary 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared with approximately for fiscal sport haley adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin in fiscal because of adopting that standard  the company changed its accounting for stock options issued to non employee directors 
the change resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of  net of taxes  in fiscal net income for fiscal was approximately million  an increase of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to the cumulative effect of changing the accounting method for stock based compensation of non employee directors in fiscal  in accordance with adopting fin  and the loss recognized on the discontinuance of headwear operations in fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  sport haley has financed its operations through a combination of revenue from operations and the public sale of equity 
sport haley intends to rely on cash generated from operations to finance its working capital requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent such amounts are insufficient to finance sport haley s working capital requirements or if working capital requirements are greater than estimated  sport haley may take down borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the primary components of adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities were changes between fiscal years relating to inventories  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  income taxes receivable  accounts payable  and accrued commissions and other expenses 
o inventories used cash of approximately  in fiscal  provided operating cash of approximately million in fiscal  and provided operating cash of approximately million in fiscal inventories decreased from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  o accounts receivable used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  and provided operating cash of approximately million in fiscal accounts receivable net of allowances increased from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  o prepaid expenses and other provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  and provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal prepaid expenses and other decreased from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  o income taxes receivable provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal and provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal income taxes receivable decreased from approximately  at june  to  at june  o accounts payable used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  and used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal accounts payable decreased from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  o accrued commission and other expenses provided operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  used operating cash of approximately  in fiscal  and used operating cash of approximately million in fiscal accrued commissions and other expenses increased from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  working capital requirements are expected to remain relatively constant

the revolving line of credit agreement  which has been renewed through november   provides for interest at below the banks prime rate 
the revolving line of credit agreement is divided into two parts  one of which provides for a maximum loan amount of million to sport haley secured by a lien on substantially all of sport haley s assets and the other of which provides for a maximum loan amount of million to the subsidiary secured by a lien on substantially all of the subsidiary s assets and guaranteed by sport haley 
sport haley generally maintains its line of credit solely to facilitate the issuance of letters of credit for inventory purchases from offshore suppliers and to fund any temporary working capital needs 
sport haley has no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at june  sport haley  in the ordinary course of its business  enters into letters of credit arrangements with a bank to facilitate the purchase of finished and packaged inventory and or raw fabric from various offshore suppliers 
as of june   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately  which related to commitments to purchase finished goods inventories from various suppliers 
amounts outstanding on letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under the lines of credit 
historically  gross proceeds received by sport haley from the exercise of stock options and warrants have fluctuated significantly from year to year 
sport haley realized proceeds of approximately in fiscal   in fiscal  and  during fiscal since december  the board of directors has authorized management to repurchase shares of sport haley s common stock  and an aggregate of  shares had been repurchased as of june  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in fiscal and  sport haley repurchased  and  shares at a cost of approximately  and million  respectively 
the board s authorization is based on its belief that sport haley s common stock is underpriced at times given its earnings  working capital  liquidity  assets  book value and future prospects

sport haley has no commitment or obligation to purchase all or any portion of the authorized shares 
all shares purchased are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued common stock 
most of sport haley s purchases from offshore manufacturers and sales to foreign distributors are us dollar denominated and  consequently  sport haley has no material currency exchange risk 
sport haley is not currently using derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates in connection with sales to its canadian distributor 
to the extent that its receivables were denominated in canadian currency that are not hedged  sport haley would be subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
management believes that inflation has not materially affected the results of operations during the three most recent fiscal years 
new accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin number sab  entitled  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab established guidelines in applying generally accepted accounting principles to the recognition of revenue in financial statements based on the following four criteria persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and  collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab  as amended by sab b  was effective no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of the company s fiscal year ending year the adoption of sab had no material effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations

business combinations sfas and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for under the purchase method 
for all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is after june   sfas also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and requires unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as extraordinary gain  rather than to be deferred and amortized 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition 
the most significant changes made by sfas are goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least annually  and  the amortization period for intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the adoptions of sfas and sfas are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position as a result of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with intangible long lived assets  including the timing of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability  and  financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
the company will adopt the statement effective january   as required 
the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the effects of the adoption of sfas on either its financial position  results of operation or cash flows
