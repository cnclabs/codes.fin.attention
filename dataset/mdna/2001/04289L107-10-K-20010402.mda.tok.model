our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under item business factors that may affect our operating results and stock price and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we were founded in december from through  we devoted our efforts principally to building  marketing and selling our professional services capabilities and to research and development activities related to our software products 
beginning in  we began to focus on selling our software products 
to date  we have enhanced and released several versions of our dynamo application server product and have completed development of our current product suite 
we began shipping the commercial version of dynamo e business platform in september we market and sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force  systems integrators  technology partners and original equipment manufacturers 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software product licenses and related services 
product license revenues are derived from the sale of software licenses of our dynamo products 
our software licenses are priced based on either the size of the customer implementation or site license terms 
services revenues are derived from fees for professional services  training and software maintenance and support 
professional services include custom application development and project and technical consulting 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis or in some cases  on a fixed price schedule defined specifically in our contracts 
software maintenance and support arrangements are priced based on the level of services provided 
generally  customers are entitled to receive software updates  maintenance releases and technical support for an annual maintenance fee of to of the list price of the licensed product 
customers that purchase maintenance and support generally receive all product updates and upgrades of software modules purchased as well as web based and telephone technical support 
training is billed as services are provided 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenues from software product license agreements are recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to delivery  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual value method in accordance with sop and sop revenues from software maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of our list price 
revenues are recognized under reseller agreements as earned which is generally ratably over the life of the reseller agreement for guaranteed minimum royalties or based upon unit sales by the resellers 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return or price protection 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized on either a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
unbilled services represent service revenues that have been earned by us in advance of billings 
services revenues have increased primarily due to the expansion of our service capabilities by hiring additional service personnel and the increase in the number of customers using our dynamo products 
sales of dynamo products often lead to sales of consulting services and software maintenance and support 
to date  substantially all of our dynamo customers have entered into annual software maintenance and support agreements at the time of purchase and have renewed such maintenance and support contracts in subsequent periods 
we believe that growth of our product license sales depends on our ability to provide customers with support  training  consulting and implementation services and to educate systems integrators and resellers on how to use and install our products 
we have invested significantly and expect to continue to invest in expanding our services organization 
we have recently begun to invest significant financial and managerial resources to expand our sales and marketing operations in international markets 
we currently maintain offices in australia  canada  england  france  germany  hong kong  japan  the netherlands  singapore and sweden 
revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in we have not entered into contracts denominated in foreign currencies to date  but may in the future 
we currently do not have hedging or similar arrangements to protect us against foreign currency fluctuations 
we  therefore  increasingly may become subject to currency fluctuations  which could harm our operating results in future periods
