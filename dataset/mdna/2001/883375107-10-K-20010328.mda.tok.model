item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview theragenics corporation is the manufacturer of theraseed  a rice sized device used primarily in treating localized prostate cancer with a one time  minimally invasive procedure 
theragenics is the world s leading producer of palladium pd  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed implant 
theragenics is also involved in research and development utilizing pd for the treatment of restenosis  macular degeneration and other diseases  and has research and development programs involving other isotopes and their uses 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed product 
under a sales and marketing agreement between theragenics and indigo medical  inc indigo entered into in may the agreement or the indigo agreement  indigo held the exclusive worldwide rights to distribute theraseed for prostate cancer 
during the third quarter of theragenics billed indigo for the difference between indigo s actual theraseed product sales and the contractual minimum purchase requirements under the terms of the agreement 
based on this demand for payment  indigo exercised its option to exit the agreement and in august gave notice of termination of the agreement  effective august by mutual agreement  indigo s termination was subsequently accelerated to january  as a result of indigo s notice of termination  the company regained the right to directly market and distribute its theraseed product for treatment of prostate cancer to physicians and third party distributors 
subsequent to indigo s notice of termination  theragenics has executed non exclusive distribution agreements with four companies for the distribution of theraseed 
the company has an active and ongoing program targeted at diversifying its future revenue stream 
as part of this program the company is constructing a facility in the oak ridge  tennessee area to house the equipment  infrastructure and work force necessary to support the production of isotopes  including pd  using unique technology being leased from the us department of energy doe 
in addition to possibly increasing its capacity and allowing for expanded use of pd  the company also believes that the doe technology may allow it to produce other isotopically engineered materials for use in medical and non medical applications 
research and development initiatives are also underway to support this diversification program 
pre clinical animal studies addressing the use of pd for the prevention of restenosis have been underway since april and preliminary data was reported in august and february the use of pd for the treatment of aged related macular degeneration is also being studied  with pre clinical animal trials expected to begin in in the company received regulatory approval for the marketing of theraseed throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining ce marking 
sales of theraseed in europe were not significant in any of the three years in the period ended december  results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
revenue during the second half of was impacted by the termination of the company s relationship with indigo  and the change to a sales and marketing strategy utilizing non exclusive distributors 
during the third quarter of  based on the billing by theragenics of a purchase minimum shortfall amount  indigo exercised its termination option and notified theragenics it would exit the agreement  effective august by mutual agreement  indigo s termination was subsequently accelerated to january  under the agreement  indigo held the exclusive worldwide rights to distribute theraseed for prostate cancer since may as a result of indigo s notice of termination  the company regained the right to directly market and distribute its theraseed product for treatment of prostate cancer to physicians and third party distributors 
see sales and marketing agreements below 
based on the importance of third party reimbursement to all providers of health care products and services  theragenics  like many others  closely monitors reimbursement of healthcare costs 
in recent years  medicare and other healthcare legislation and regulations have created reimbursement concerns for the entire healthcare industry 
the us congress and the health care financing administration hcfa frequently consider reforms that provide for reductions in medicare spending and prospective payment reform on healthcare purchasing levels and payment streams 
due to the significance of these actions on revenue streams  management expects that it  along with its non exclusive distributors  will continue to monitor the activities of the us congress and hcfa as they relate to medicare and prospective payments 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments received for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees have not been  nor does management expect them to become  material in the foreseeable future 
gross profit decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decline in gross profit margin was primarily a result of the increase in depreciation expense for the additional cyclotrons that were ordered almost two years ago to meet sales forecasts made at that time by indigo 
the non cash depreciation charge related to manufacturing for increased to million from million for the increase reflects fourteen cyclotrons being in operation by december   versus only eleven cyclotrons in operation by december  the increase in depreciation was partially offset by improved efficiencies and automation in the company s proprietary production processes  and the utilization of certain manufacturing materials and resources in research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits  customer service and patient information expenses which had been previously borne by indigo prior to august  and start up costs related to the company s construction project in oak ridge  tennessee 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in legal and professional fees 
the company expects increases in sg a expenses as a result of the termination of the indigo agreement 
see sales and marketing agreements below 
research and development r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in  compared to  or of revenue  in the increase in r d expenses was a result of the company s r d initiatives  including restenosis studies carried out by the atlanta cardiovascular research institute see below  and development efforts to improve the company s proprietary production processes 
the company s research and development initiatives are intended to expand the application of pd and theraseed to other oncological and non oncological uses  and explore options for using the company s expertise and capabilities in other areas 
management plans to continue to increase efforts in research and development as its initiatives to diversify move forward and expects r d expenditures to increase to as much as of revenue in however  r d spending is dependent on the complex scheduling of research and development activities in progress as well as the pursuit of other appropriate opportunities as they arise 
accordingly  r d expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
as part of its r d initiatives  the company has an agreement with the atlanta cardiovascular research institute acri to conduct pre clinical animal studies addressing the use of pd for the prevention of restenosis 
restenosis is the reclosing of arteries that often occurs after coronary angioplasties 
it is estimated that nearly one third of the  coronary angioplasties performed in the united states each year fail or restenose within the first few months of the operation 
in the first phase of the study  which began in april  the company delivered catheter based pd devices to acri to demonstrate the effectiveness of pd in inhibiting restenosis like changes in pig coronary arteries after balloon angioplasty 
the preliminary data from phase i of the study  reported in august  showed that the inhibitory effects of pd are similar to that of other emitters  both beta and gamma  with efficacy possibly achieved with a lower dose 
based on the preliminary data  the company is continuing its pre clinical animal studies  and expects longer term data to be available in the company is planning to conduct clinical feasibility trials in humans for coronary in stent restenosis in the commencement and completion of any human trials will be dependent upon receiving successful results from the ongoing additional pre clinical animal studies  as well as the evaluation of potential competing forms of treatment 
other r d efforts are also underway  including the use of pd in treating the wet form of aged related macular degeneration 
this disease is a degeneration of eyesight that  in some cases  can lead to complete blindness 
the company expects to begin animal studies for this application during other income  excluding minimum income described below  increased to million in from million in other income consists primarily of interest income generated from the company s short term investments and high quality municipal bond investments 
the increase was attributable to additional funds being available for investment during as a result of cash generated from operations 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and research and development activities 
to the extent that funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company recognized million of other income in the third quarter of related to theragenics billing for purchase minimum shortfalls under the sales and marketing agreement with indigo 
this increased net earnings during by million  or 
per diluted share 
see sales and marketing agreements below 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for and the company s income tax rate in each period is lower than the statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects and research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
sales and marketing agreements during the first half of  indigo did not meet the contractual minimum purchase requirements under the terms of the sales and marketing agreement between the company and indigo the agreement or the indigo agreement 
as provided by the agreement  in the third quarter of  the company invoiced indigo for payments totaling million relating to the shortfall in the minimum purchase requirements for the first half of as a result of this demand for payment  indigo had the option to exit the agreement upon one year s notice and  in august  exercised this option 
under the termination provisions of the agreement and upon exercise of their termination option  indigo immediately forfeited exclusive sales and marketing rights  but retained non exclusive sales and marketing rights to theraseed for prostate cancer until august  in december  the parties agreed to accelerate the termination of indigo s distribution rights to be effective january  as a result of the accelerated termination  theragenics agreed to waive any capital carrying costs that indigo would have otherwise been obligated to pay under the provisions of termination in the agreement 
the carrying costs that would have been payable by indigo would have been based on the cost of cyclotrons already in service but not being used to full capacity to support product sales 
since that calculation is dependent on actual product sales  the actual amount of the carrying costs waived cannot be determined 
indigo is also prohibited from selling a competing radioactive device for the treatment of prostate cancer through august  as of january   indigo no longer distributes theraseed and the former indigo customers can order theraseed implants directly from theragenics or any of the company s non exclusive distributors 
if indigo had not exercised its option to exit the agreement  the shortfall in the minimum purchase requirements for the first half of would have been subject to adjustment  based on indigo s sales of theraseed during the second half of indigo s notification of termination in august eliminated the possibility of adjustment and  accordingly  theragenics recorded the million purchase minimum amount due from indigo as other income in the third quarter of the million payment  which was also received from indigo in the third quarter of  added approximately million or per diluted share to net earnings for the year 
as a result of indigo s decision to exit the agreement  the company immediately regained the right to sell theraseed for prostate cancer treatment directly to physicians and to other third party distributors 
subsequent to indigo s august decision to exit the agreement  theragenics executed non exclusive distribution agreements with four companies for the distribution of theraseed  nycomed amersham  a provider of medical diagnostics and radiotherapy products  imagyn medical technologies  inc  a manufacturer and distributor of medical devices  including brachytherapy products for the treatment of cancer  cr bard  inc  a multinational developer  manufacturer and marketer of healthcare products in the fields of vascular  urology  oncology and surgical specialty products  and prostate services of america  inc  a nationwide supplier of complete solutions for prostate brachytherapy 
the five year agreements give each distributor the right to distribute theraseed immediately in the us  canada and puerto rico for the treatment of prostate cancer and other solid localized cancerous tumors 
the company continues to explore additional non exclusive distribution agreements in order to take advantage of multiple distribution channels and expand its market coverage 
to the extent that the company is able to obtain sales directly to physicians for its own account  the distributors margin  which can run approximately to  would be captured by theragenics  in addition to its margin as manufacturer 
for sales through the non exclusive distributor agreements  this margin will be captured by the distributor  similar to the indigo agreement 
since the company does not currently intend to build its own sales force  theragenics ability to capture theraseed accounts for direct to physician sales will primarily be a function of the sales and marketing success of competitors  including the company s non exclusive distributors 
theragenics expects its non exclusive distributors to aggressively market to the former indigo customers 
accordingly  the company expects that its average per unit sales price will increase slightly early in  but rapidly decline to the level 
the company expects that marketing expenses could increase by up to million in the next year as it supports its brand in an attempt to increase demand for theraseed implants 
it is expected that this support will take the form of theraseed brand advertising to consumers and physicians  clinical studies aimed at showing the superiority of theraseed implants in the treatment of prostate cancer  technical field support to theraseed customers and other customer service and patient information activities 
over the past thirteen years  and prior to indigo exiting from the agreement  the company took all orders for theraseed  performed all customer service and patient information functions  and shipped theraseed directly to physicians 
because these functions have always been performed by theragenics  minimal interruption of service or product delivery to current customers is expected 
however  as with any significant change  transition challenges associated with these marketing and distribution changes may arise that could significantly impact the theraseed market and thereby theragenics  near term financial performance 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the company believes that adjustments indigo made to its sales and marketing programs for theraseed from the prior year contributed to the increase in sales 
licensing fees represent royalty payments with respect to the company s licensed therasphere technology 
gross profit percentage decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease was attributable to an increase in the manufacturing fixed cost base as depreciation and other fixed expenses associated with additional cyclotrons and new manufacturing facilities were incurred during as additional cyclotrons come on line  margins generally decline because each machine represents excess capacity for a period while carrying its full component of fixed costs  including depreciation 
eleven cyclotrons were operational at december  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in  reflecting an increase of  or 
this increase was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits as a result of the increasing scope of the company  s operations 
research and development r d expenses were  in compared to  in the increase in r d expenses was a result of development efforts to improve the company  s proprietary production processes and an increased emphasis on the company  s r d initiatives 
other income was approximately million for both and  comprised primarily of interest income generated from the company  s short term investments and high quality municipal bond investments 
the company  s effective income tax rate was for and for the company  s income tax rate in each period is lower than the statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company  s investments in its expansion projects and research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  short term investments and marketable securities of million at december   compared to million at december  marketable securities consist primarily of high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company  s investment policies 
the increase in cash  short term investments and marketable securities was a result of cash generated by operations  including the receipt of the purchase minimum payment from indigo  partially offset by capital expenditures 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  the company also has an unsecured credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for maximum borrowings of million under two lines of credit  and an additional uncommitted million line of credit 
letters of credit totaling approximately  were outstanding under the terms of the unsecured credit agreement at december  cash generated by operations was million and million in and  respectively 
cash generated from operations consists of net earnings plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and deferred income tax expense 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in the increase in depreciation and amortization was a result of the increase in the number of cyclotrons that were operational during the company  s primary use of cash in and related to capital spending to increase manufacturing capacity 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures related primarily to the company  s psp project see below  the addition of cyclotrons and supporting facilities and the company  s new headquarters facility 
the us department of energy doe has granted theragenics access to unique doe technology  known as the plasma separation process psp  for use in production of isotopes  including pd the  psp project 
this technology venture represents part of a doe initiative to redirect cold war assets to peacetime use and cushion the economic impact of us defense department cutbacks 
the company expects that the use of the psp technology could significantly increase its pd capacity and allow for expanded use of pd and theraseed beyond treatment of prostate cancer to new medical applications 
the company also believes that the psp project may allow it to explore options for applying this technology to other uses  including the production of isotopically engineered materials for use in medical and non medical applications  though there are no assurances that this will be achieved 
the company is constructing a facility in the oak ridge  tennessee area to house the equipment  infrastructure and work force necessary to support the production of isotopes  including pd  using this doe technology 
construction costs of approximately million have been incurred on the psp project through december   and the company expects to invest an additional million million through to complete this manufacturing and r d facility 
the psp project is expected to become operational in  though no revenues are expected to be generated from the psp project in accordingly  the psp project is expected to increase operating expenses by approximately million in  with the significant portion of these expenses incurred in the second half of the year 
additionally  costs to be incurred in the production of stable isotopes are expected to require an investment in inventory of up to million 
as part of the psp project  the company has leased land in the oak ridge  tennessee area and equipment previously used by the government to produce isotopes 
as a result of the sensitive nature of the equipment  the specialized technology involved and the restrictions on access to unique doe operated facilities  the company has contracted with the doe  s primary contractor for the oak ridge government installation to handle certain technical and operational services that are critical to the project  including moving  reassembling and recommissioning equipment currently in storage  designing and fabricating new parts and modifications to the equipment and doe facilities  and operating and providing ongoing access to the doe facilities 
the success of the project is dependent on the continued cooperation of the doe and its primary contractor  which could be adversely affected by future changes in governmental program priorities and funding 
if the equipment cannot be moved and recommissioned successfully  if there are problems with the operation or modification of the doe operated facilities  or if unforeseen challenges arise  the project may not be successful or the costs or timeliness associated with the project could exceed current estimates 
in addition to using cash to fund the psp project in  the company expects that r d spending will continue to increase 
pre clinical animal studies addressing the use of pd for the prevention of restenosis are underway  and other r d activities are also occurring see  results of operations  above 
the company expects that r d expense spending may total up to approximately of revenue in  but could vary depending on the scheduling and progress of r d activities as well as the pursuit of currently unforeseen opportunities 
cash provided by financing activities was  and  in and  respectively  and primarily consisted of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
also included  in financing fees paid in connection with the company  s million unsecured credit facility 
the company believes that current cash and investment balances  cash from future operations and credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  management may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appropriate
