trends in operations allied reported excellent results for while vsk continues to contribute solid revenue and earnings  allied s results were largely driven by mecar s return to profitable operations 
mecar began to receive substantial orders from its traditional customer base in the latter portion of such orders continued in as a result  mecar operated at or near capacity of its facilities throughout much of the increase in orders from mecar s traditional customer base coincided with a substantial increase in worldwide oil prices 
allied believes that this price increase positively impacted its customers purchasing power which in turn lead to increased orders 
the vast majority of mecar s revenues resulted from orders from its traditional customer base 
mecar s revenues included contracts for the benefit of its customers via the foreign military sales program fms as well as from direct and indirect contracts with foreign governments 
mecar has supplied both mm ammunition and mm mortar ammunition for use in two new weapon systems acquired by one of mecar s traditional customers via fms contracts 
the customer has indicated a need and desire for additional rounds of each of the mm ammunition and mm mortar ammunition 
allied believes that an additional order or orders for such rounds could be received in mecar continues to supply a wide variety of medium and large caliber ammunition to its customers via direct and indirect contracts with its customer countries 
non fms sales to mecar s traditional customers have historically been made with the assistance of an independent marketing representative  which also provided significant product and customer support 
in  mecar designated an affiliate of the representative as its distributor value added reseller to the principal customers 
thus  these sales are now being made on an indirect basis to its traditional customers 
allied does not anticipate that this change will adversely affect mecar  its operations or its profitability 
during  mecar received a relatively small order from a new south american customer 
mecar continues to actively pursue the south american market 
mecar is in active negotiations with another south american country which is hoped will lead to another order in in march  mecar received two new contracts aggregating one of the contracts is from its traditional customer base and one of the contracts is from a new country customer 
the vsk group recorded another excellent year in it contributed approximately in revenues and in profits 
during  the vsk group s work for belgian banks increased from prior levels and the vsk group successfully integrated vigitec a subsidiary acquired in december  
the results of the vsk group were off slightly from results due  in part  to reduced operating margins 
both mecar s and the vsk group s reported earnings for the year were adversely impacted by the fluctuations of the euro during during  mecar utilized the euro as its principal currency and the vsk group utilized the belgian franc  which is linked to the euro 
commencing january   the vsk group joined mecar in conducting its operations via the euro 
allied commenced with a consolidated backlog of approximately compared with a consolidated backlog at the beginning of of mecar began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of vsk began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of approximately in future periods  allied s operations will continue to be impacted by mecar s ability to obtain large orders on a periodic basis and allied s ability to successfully continue its expansion of other business 
trends in liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity did not materially improve in despite the excellent operating results and an increase in working capital 
as a result of losses incurred in and substantial purchases required by its increased workload  mecar obtained a line of credit in early to fund working capital requirements 
at december   the outstanding balance under the line of credit was it is anticipated that the line of credit will be fully repaid by the end of april  in addition  allied made advances of to mecar throughout to supplement mecar s working capital which are scheduled to be repaid in the spring of in an effort to minimize the liquidity shortage at mecar  during the bank pool provided a partial waiver of the requirement to pledge cash to collateralize performance bonds and advance payment guarantees issued by the bank pool for the benefit of mecar 
it is anticipated that the waiver will expire in mid year at which point mecar will be required to provide the full amount of restricted cash as collateral as required by the bank pool agreement 
no liquidity problems are forecast for in the longer term  allied s liquidity will continue to depend upon its ability to obtain substantial orders from its traditional customer base and the success of its efforts to broaden its revenue base 
liquidity 
working capital  which includes restricted cash  was approximately at december   which is an increase of from the december  level 
allied s current working capital is required for operations and to support credit facility agreements 
cash and equivalents at december  increased over year end levels largely as a result of the partial cash collateral requirement waiver by the bank pool 
this increase was offset by lower levels of restricted cash 
accounts receivable at december  increased over december  levels by due to substantial year end shipments by mecar 
costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts increased by from year end levels as a result of increased amounts of work in progress at the end of inventories at year end were higher than at the end of due to the increased workload at mecar 
prepaid expenses increased over levels as a result of advance payments on contracts in process at year end 
intangibles at year end decreased from levels due to annual amortization 
deferred taxes decreased in by as a result of the utilization of tax loss carryforwards generated in at mecar that were used in the current year 
current liabilities increased by over december  levels due to a substantial increase in bank debt  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and customer deposits at the end of associated with the increased work at mecar 
long term debt increased during by as a result of equipment purchases during the year 
during  and  allied funded its operations principally with internally generated cash and back up credit facilities required for foreign government contracts 
in addition  mecar utilized a line of credit throughout mecar typically obtains relatively large orders for its ammunition and weapon systems which require credit facilities to provide import letters of credit  advance payment guarantees and performance bonds 
these needs have been met in the last few years via agreements primarily with a multi member foreign bank pool 
as has been the case in recent years  the bank pool must agree to extend such facility to new orders as they are received by mecar 
while management believes that it will be able to finance additional mecar contracts using the bank pool structure  there can be no assurance that such financing will be provided 
the bank pool agreement and other loan agreements continue to impose certain restrictions on mecar 
mecar s obligations were collateralized at december  by a pledge on mecar s assets of the bank pool agreement further precludes mecar from making payments to any company in the allied group in excess of per year  unless mecar has unrestricted cash in excess of mecar s obligations under the bank agreement  after giving effect to the european reorganization of arc europe  are also supported by a guarantee provided by allied and a pledge of the stock of the vsk group 
mecar has a mortgage loan with a foreign government agency which had an outstanding balance of approximately at december  principal and interest payments on the mortgage loan extend through january   and the loan includes a prepayment penalty clause 
the vsk group operated throughout primarily from cash generated from operations 
the vsk group is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations with december  balances aggregating it is also obligated on letters of credit required by a contract with a customer 
on january   eleven member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro is currently trading on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  cash less payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january   and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
mecar has adopted the euro as its functional currency 
the vsk group used the belgian franc as its primary currency in  effective january   the vsk group adopted the euro as its functional currency 
allied will continue to evaluate all issues involving the introduction of the euro as further accounting  tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance becomes available 
based on current information and allied s current assessment  allied does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
however  its operations in were adversely impacted by the fluctuations in the value of the euro versus the us dollar 
in september  allied s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of allied s common stock 
during  and  allied repurchased   and  shares of its common stock in market transactions 
the company does not anticipate repurchasing shares of company stock at the same rate in calendar year allied s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar 
capital resources 
allied spent in on capital equipment as compared with in and in  respectively 
the expenditures in were primarily for new equipment for mecar 
management currently anticipates that it will spend approximately on capital expenditures in for additional upgrades to the mecar and vsk group facilities and equipment

revenues allied s consolidated revenues from continuing operations for increased  or  over revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for decreased  or  as compared to revenues by segment millions amount amount amount mecar vsk mecar s revenues for increased by over its revenues 
mecar s revenues were only of its revenues 
the increase in revenues is attributable to increased order levels for its products

in  revenues at the vsk group decreased approximately from revenues 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for was approximately compared with for and for the decreased cost of sales percentage was primarily attributable to increased revenue at mecar  changes in the mix of products being produced and the price structure on orders received from mecar s distributor value added reseller 
costs in were higher than normal as a result of rework costs on orders for certain customers 
selling and administrative expenses selling and general administrative expenses in increased less than over those incurred in  primarily as a result of continued cost containment efforts over the past three years 
selling and general administrative expenses in were greater than those incurred in principally as a result of costs incurred in the proxy solicitation contest 
research and development research and development costs incurred in decreased by or from levels 
the reduction is attributable to the work load associated with contracts in process during the year 
research and development costs incurred in increased by or over levels

pre tax profit from continuing operations pre tax profit loss by segment millions amount amount amount mecar vsk corporate and other mecar s pre tax profit was largely attributable to its increased revenue 
mecar s loss resulted from insufficient revenue and unanticipated costs to rework products for certain customers 
the vsk group s pre tax profit decreased by from its level due to reduced operating margins and exchange rate changes 
the vsk group s pre tax profit decreased slightly from levels as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
income taxes the effective income tax expense attributable to continuing operations in was  primarily due to foreign rate differentials and permanent tax differences 
the company reported a tax benefit relating to continuing operations in principally as a result of the deferred tax benefits of tax loss carryforwards attributable to mecar s operating losses  less belgium taxes attributable to the vsk group s operations and domestic tax expenses

the company s loss from discontinued operations of in and its net income of in is from bri operations 
impact of year through february   the company has not experienced any significant problems related to the yk issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at year end  allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and cash available for investment  a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than exchange rate sensitivity 
allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
virtually all of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from allied s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates associated with some  but not all  of its contracts in which the expenses for providing services are incurred in currency other than the functional currency of allied s foreign subsidiaries or payments on contracts are made by the customer in another currency 
the objective of these contracts is to hedge fixed obligations to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on allied s foreign subsidiaries operating results 
additionally  allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than 
allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
