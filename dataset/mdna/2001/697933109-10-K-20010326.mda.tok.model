item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations year ended december  in thousands  except per share data revenues operating leases  satellite services and other    outright sales and sales type leases    total revenue    costs and expenses cost of outright sales and sales type leases  leaseback expense  net of deferred gains   direct operating and sg a costs    gain on galaxy vii insurance claim  depreciation and amortization    total    income from operations    interest expense  net    income before income taxes    income tax expense    net income    net income per share basic and diluted consolidated results compared to revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to million of additional revenues during from new outright sales and sales type leases of satellite transponders for which there were no comparable transactions in the company records certain contractual transactions as sales type leases in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
most of the revenues from these agreements are recognized at service commencement  whereas revenues from operating lease agreements are recognized monthly over the term of the lease agreement 
video services revenues  excluding new sales type lease agreements were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the same period in the decrease was primarily due to customer conversions from operating lease agreements into sales type lease agreements during the first half of and the termination of a contract for a dth platform in india in network services formerly telecommunications services revenues  excluding new outright sales  were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the same period in the increase was due primarily to growth in data and internet related service agreements 
revenues from outright sales and sales type leases increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase is attributable to the new outright sales and sales type lease transactions discussed above 
revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to customer conversions from operating lease agreements into sales type lease agreements during the first half of and the termination of a contract for a dth platform in india in cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders 
the company recorded million of costs of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders for the year ended december  for which there were no comparable transactions in leaseback expense  net of deferred gains 
the exercise of all remaining early buy out opportunities on sale leaseback agreements was completed in as a result  the company recorded no leaseback expense  net of deferred gains  for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs 
direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to direct costs associated with the company s continued fleet expansion  costs associated with its net initiative  additional staffing to support other growth initiatives and a million one time charge associated with a sale of real estate 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  due primarily to depreciation expense associated with the addition of four new satellites placed in service in  depreciation expense on transponders acquired through the exercise of sale leaseback early buy outs and the acceleration of depreciation on the galaxy viii i satellite  which began in the fourth quarter of income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the gross profit associated with the new outright sales and sales type lease activity in offset by increased depreciation expense and direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was due primarily to the increase in interest rates associated with the company s floating rate debt during partially offset by lower borrowing levels in income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the company s effective tax rate was in the year ended december   compared to in the same period in the decrease was due to increased tax benefits related to the company s foreign sales corporation 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in video services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the same period in the increase was primarily due to new service agreements on satellites placed in service in  as well as continued growth in special events service revenues as compared to the same period in network services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the same period in the increase was due primarily to the growth in data and internet related service agreements 
revenue results can also be analyzed based on the type of agreement 
revenues from sales and sales type leases decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease is attributable to a lower volume in relative to of outright sales and sales type leases 
revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the commencement of commercial service on new international satellites  as well as continued growth in special events service revenues in leaseback expense  net of deferred gain 
leaseback expense  net of deferred gain  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the exercise by the company of early buy out opportunities on sale leaseback agreements during direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs 
direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to direct costs associated with additional satellites placed in service and operating costs associated with the normal growth of the company attributable to the growth in the size of the satellite network 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  due primarily to depreciation expense associated with additional satellites placed in service 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue generated by the expanded satellite network and decreased leaseback expense  net of deferred gain as a result of the exercise by the company of early buy out opportunities  offset by increased depreciation and direct operating costs associated with the company s expanded satellite network 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from new debt assumed in connection with the exercise of an early buy out opportunity under a sale leaseback transaction during as well as increased borrowing levels during the year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase resulted from a reduction in foreign sales corporation tax benefits in satellite deployment plan and planned satellites satellite deployment plan panamsat s satellite deployment plan is intended to enable the company to provide back up and replacement capacity as well as expanded satellite services on an expedited basis in the united states and worldwide 
panamsat launched five satellites since december  galaxy xi  galaxy xr  galaxy ivr  pas and pas r  on december   january   april   july  and november   respectively 
panamsat also retired two satellites  sbs and sbs  and experienced the failure of galaxy vii during panamsat expects to launch four additional satellites by early  consisting of galaxy iii c which will replace galaxy iiir for the nar and the aor  galaxy viii ir which will replace galaxy viii i for the aor  pas for the ior and a new satellite for the nar yet to be named 
this will result in a planned total fleet of satellites  including multiple satellites in each ocean region worldwide and one in orbit spare satellite galaxy vi for the united states 
the company also has options to procure three additional satellites 
planned satellites pas this satellite will be a boeing hp spacecraft 
it is scheduled for launch in the second quarter of on a proton launch vehicle and is expected to occupy an orbital position in the ior at degrees el some of the company s key customers on pas have contracted to migrate to pas upon its deployment 
galaxy iii c 
this satellite will be a boeing spacecraft  designed to cover the united states and latin america 
it is scheduled to be launched in the third quarter of and it is expected to occupy an orbital position located at degrees wl galaxy viii ir 
this satellite will be a boeing hp spacecraft designed to cover latin america and serve as an on ground spare as back up for the launch of galaxy iiic  and then a replacement for galaxy viii i 
it is scheduled to be launched in the third quarter of and it is expected to occupy an orbital position located at degrees wl the company has entered into a contract with an affiliate of directv latin america which is an affiliate of the company for the lease of capacity on galaxy viii ir  but such contract may be terminated by the customer following the successful launch of galaxy iii c 
if the lease were terminated  the company would either modify galaxy viii ir for another use or terminate its contract with boeing for the construction of galaxy viii ir 
the company would also postpone or terminate the launch service contracted for galaxy viii ir 
in such event  the customer would be obligated to pay the company over time for all of the company s contractual liabilities to boeing and the launch services provider for such modification  postponement and or termination 
new nar satellite 
this c band satellite  to be named in the future  will be constructed by orbital sciences corporation and designed to cover the united states 
it is scheduled to be launched in late or early and is expected to occupy an orbital position located at degrees wl  co located with the company s sbs satellite 
as a result of the company s planned launches  the company currently intends to relocate a number of its satellites 

galaxy iii c is expected to be deployed at degrees wl  galaxy iiir s current location  to provide services to the united states and latin america 
upon this deployment  galaxy iiir will be moved for service at a new orbital location to be determined 

pas is expected to be deployed at degrees el  pas s current location 
upon this deployment  pas will be moved for service at a new orbital location to be determined 

galaxy viii ir is expected to be deployed at degrees wl  galaxy viii i s current location 
upon this deployment  galaxy viii i will be retired 
the implementation of the satellite deployment plan is subject to regulatory approval by the fcc 
the company expects that after the launch of the satellites as described above  the revenues attributable to the pas satellite will be at reduced levels compared to most of the company s other satellites 
the company has not yet determined whether revenue will be adversely affected on galaxy iiir after the completion of the satellite deployment plan 
no assurance can be given that commercially suitable orbital locations will be obtained for all of these satellites 
successful implementation of the satellite deployment plan is subject to risks attendant to the company s business and the requirement of additional capital 
see liquidity and capital resources and risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources in connection with the merger  the company obtained a term loan in the amount of billion the hughes term loan from hughes electronics 
the hughes term loan matures in june  and bears interest at a rate equal to that of the revolving credit facility as defined below 
pursuant to the hughes term loan  quarterly principal payments of million are required under certain circumstances depending upon the level of cash flow from operations and the company s credit ratings 
as of march   the company was not required to make any principal payments on the hughes term loan as a result of its credit rating 
hughes electronics has the right to request that the company use its best efforts to replace the hughes term loan with another credit facility on terms that may then be available to the company 
as of march   hughes electronics had not requested the company to replace the borrowings 
in addition to the hughes term loan  as of december   the company also had long term indebtedness of million comprised primarily of million of notes as defined below and million of notes assumed in connection with the exercise of an early buy out opportunity under a sale leaseback transaction as described below 
on january   panamsat completed a private placement pursuant to rule a under the securities act of for million aggregate principal amount of debt securities the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay bank loans incurred partially to finance a tender offer for certain debt securities of panamsat s subsidiaries  as well as for general corporate purposes 
in august  the company converted the private securities to public debt the notes by means of a registered exchange offer 
the notes bear interest at various rates ranging from to and have five  seven  ten and year maturity dates 
the company is party to a credit agreement dated december   the credit agreement with certain lenders and citicorp usa  inc as administrative agent 
the credit agreement provides the company with loans of up to million under a five year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a rate based upon either a defined base rate  or libor plus applicable margins that are based on the company s credit rating 
the interest margins include a component that is a facility fee  which ranges from to depending on the rating level 
on july   the company initiated a million commercial paper program the commercial paper program 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the commercial paper program are limited to million in the aggregate and are expected to be used to fund the company s satellite construction program 
there are currently no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the revolving credit facility 
during the third quarter of  the company s credit ratings were downgraded to bbb a by standard and poor s 
as a result of this downgrade  the company expects that it will not issue commercial paper pursuant to its commercial paper program and instead expects to draw upon its revolving credit facility to fund its borrowing needs 
the hughes term loan is subordinate to the notes issued in connection with the offering  the revolving credit facility and any notes issued under the commercial paper program 
in april  the company filed two insurance claims related to anomalies on its pas and pas satellites 
the claim on the pas satellite was for a partial loss primarily resulting from the loss in geographic coverage  connectivity and or switchability of the ku band transponders 
the claim on pas was for a constructive total loss of the satellite because the company had ceased using all of the ku band capacity of the satellite on a full time basis  which represents more than of the satellite s communications capacity 
in august  the company filed an insurance claim on its galaxy viii i satellite for a partial loss primarily resulting from battery cell failures 
in september  the company met with its insurance carriers and agreed to settle all of the claims for net cash to panamsat of approximately million 
the insurance settlements were recognized as offsets to the carrying values of the related satellites  and no gain or loss has been recognized as a result of these settlements 
in the third quarter of  the galaxy viii i satellite experienced difficulties with its xenon ion propulsion system xips  an electronic propulsion system that is used to maintain the spacecraft s proper orbit and position relative to earth 
the satellite is operating normally on its backup chemical propulsion system 
without the use of xips  the spacecraft is expected to reach its end of life in late panamsat accelerated depreciation of the spacecraft to reflect its revised operational life  resulting in an increase in its depreciation expense beginning in the fourth quarter of of approximately million per quarter 
in december  the company filed an insurance claim related to the failure of its galaxy vii satellite  which ceased transmissions on november  due to the failure of an onboard system responsible for controlling the spacecraft and maintaining its position relative to earth 
the insurance settlement in the amount of million was recognized as an offset to the carrying value of the satellite and resulted in a million gain from proceeds in excess of the carrying value 
the company had options under sale leaseback arrangements to repurchase the transponders on galaxy vii and galaxy iiir prior to the end of their respective lease terms 
in january  the company repurchased c band and ku band transponders on galaxy vii for approximately million  including a make whole premium of million 
the company repurchased the remaining transponders on galaxy vii and the ku band transponders on galaxy iiir in july for a total cost of approximately million in cash  plus the assumption of million of floating rate debt secured by the galaxy iiir ku band transponders 
the notes bear interest at libor plus and mature on january  as of march   the outstanding principal balance of these notes was million 
as of december   other than indemnity obligations  the company no longer had any obligations under sale leaseback agreements 
the significant cash outlays for the company will continue to be primarily capital expenditures related to the construction and launch of satellites  debt service costs and potential acquisitions 
the company has satellites under various stages of development and intends to deploy net for which it has budgeted capital expenditures 
according to the company s capital plan  panamsat currently expects to spend approximately billion to construct  insure and launch satellites  and plans to invest between million and million in capital and operating expenses over the next two years to deploy net the largest portion of panamsat s investment in net will be used to deploy panamsat owned antennas and servers at isps  cable headends and dsl provider sites 
assuming satellites in development are successfully launched  services on the satellites commence on the schedule currently contemplated and net is deployed as and when expected  panamsat believes that amounts available under its million revolving credit facility  vendor financing  future cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund its operations and its remaining costs for the construction and launch of satellites currently under development for the next twelve months and for the deployment of net for the next twenty four months 
there can be no assurance  however  that panamsat s assumptions with respect to costs for future construction and launch of its satellites and costs to deploy net will be correct  or that amounts available under the revolving credit facility  vendor financing  future cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to cover any shortfall in funding for i launches caused by launch failures  ii cost overruns  iii delays  iv capacity shortages  v net technical integration problems  vi additional costs associated with net strategic relationships or vii other unanticipated expenses 
in addition  if the company were to consummate any strategic transactions or undertake any other projects requiring significant capital expenditures  it may be required to seek additional financing 
if circumstances were to require panamsat to incur additional indebtedness  the ability of panamsat to incur any such additional indebtedness would be subject to the terms of panamsat s outstanding indebtedness 
the failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on panamsat s operations and its ability to accomplish its business plan 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in  from million in and million in the decrease in was primarily attributable to an increase in the gross profit earned on sales and sales type leases during and lower margins associated with operating leases compared to the decrease in was primarily attributable to proceeds from insurance claims received during related to operating assets 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million in  from million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower capital expenditures compared to and the absence of early buy outs of sale leasebacks during  offset by lower proceeds from insurance 
the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in and net cash provided by financing activities of million in the decrease in and was primarily due to lower net borrowings associated with the company s satellites under construction 
accounting changes statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
the company adopted sfas effective january  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
market risks the following discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses referred to below includes forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain market conditions may occur 
actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions because the amounts noted below are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof 
accordingly  the forward looking statements should not be considered projections by panamsat of future events or losses 
panamsat s cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in interest rates and certain of its financial instruments are subject to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
panamsat manages its exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
panamsat s policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
panamsat does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
as of december  and december   long term debt consisted of fixed rate borrowings of million  billion of floating rate merger related borrowings due to hughes and various other fixed and floating rate borrowings 
panamsat is subject to fluctuating interest rates on its floating rate debt and any changes in interest rates would impact results of operations and cash flows 
the potential effect of a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates for one year on panamsat s floating rate debt outstanding at december  and would be a reduction in cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  and a reduction in net income of approximately million and million  in each year 
fluctuations in interest rates may also affect the fair values of fixed rate borrowings and fixed rate net investments in sales type lease receivables 
at december  and  outstanding borrowings bore interest at rates ranging from to and sales type lease receivables bore interest between and 
the potential fair value change resulting from a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates related to panamsat s outstanding debt and sales type receivable balances would be approximately million and million as of december  and million and million as of december   respectively 
in connection with debt refinancing activities in  panamsat entered into certain us treasury rate lock contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the aggregate notional value of these contracts was million and these contracts were accounted for as hedges 
the cost to settle these instruments in was million and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt securities 
risk factors risk of launch failure 
satellites are subject to certain risks related to delayed and failed launches 
of the satellite launches by panamsat or its predecessors since  the company has experienced four launch failures 
for example  in the company s galaxy x satellite was destroyed during the inaugural launch of the boeing delta iii rocket which exploded shortly after liftoff 
in addition  certain launch vehicles scheduled to be used by panamsat have unproven track records and are susceptible to certain risks associated with new launch vehicles 
for example  on october   a proton launch vehicle that did not carry any of the company s satellites suffered a launch failure 
the company expects to use a proton launch vehicle to launch pas in the second quarter of the sea launch is a launcher that is scheduled to be used by panamsat to launch a satellite in the third quarter of although successful demonstration launches on the sea launch were completed in march and a successful commercial launch was conducted in october  a commercial satellite launched from sea launch by a british communications company failed in march just after liftoff 
sea launch then successfully launched panamsat s pas satellite in july and the thuraya satellite for the thuraya satellite telecommunications company in october sea launch is scheduled to launch two additional satellites and then panamsat s galaxy iiic satellite in the third quarter of although panamsat s insurance coverage for these potential losses is sufficient to substantially recover the company s investment  the company does not obtain insurance to recover lost revenues or business opportunities 
in addition  the design  construction and delivery of a replacement satellite could take up to months 
risk of construction and launch delays 
the company has in the past experienced delays in satellite construction and launch which have had an adverse effect on revenues 
future delays may have the same effect 
such delays can result from the delays in the construction of satellites and launch vehicles  the periodic unavailability of reliable launch opportunities  possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and launch failures 
launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites and obtain other launch opportunities 
further  a significant delay in the delivery of any satellite would adversely affect the company s marketing plan for the satellite 
if satellite construction schedules are not met  there can be no assurance that a launch opportunity will be available at the time a satellite is ready to be launched 
finally  any significant delay in the commencement of service of any of panamsat s satellites could enable customers who pre purchased or agreed to lease capacity of the satellites to terminate their contracts 
the failure to implement panamsat s satellite deployment plan on schedule could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of in orbit failure or reduced performance 
satellites are also subject to risks after they have been properly deployed and put into operation 
if any of these risks occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
these risks include  but are not limited to 
manufacturing errors following the launch of the company s pas satellite  an error of the satellite s manufacturer was discovered that affected the geographical coverage or flexibility of all of the ku band transponders on the satellite 
the c band beams have not been affected by the error 

new technology the likelihood of in orbit failure or performance reduction may be heightened by panamsat s use of new technology on certain of its satellites 
galaxy xi  pas r and galaxy iii c are boeing model spacecraft 
prior to galaxy xi  the boeing model had no track record and may be susceptible to certain risks related to its new technology 
there can be no assurance that panamsat s use of the boeing model spacecraft will continue to be successful 

circuit failures pas experienced several circuit failures in its solar arrays and may experience additional failures in the future 
circuit failures require the company to forego the use of some transponders initially and to turn off additional transponders in later years 
no assurance can be given that additional circuit failures will not occur 

spacecraft control processor failures three of the company s satellites  galaxy iv  galaxy vii and pas  experienced an anomaly in their on board spacecraft control processors scps  which are believed to have resulted from electrical short circuits involving tin plated relay switches 
each satellite contains a primary scp and a back up scp 
galaxy iv was declared a total loss in may after both of its scps failed and on november   the company announced the failure of the second scp on galaxy vii resulting in the loss of the satellite 
pas is operating on its back up scp system after its primary scp failed and is scheduled to be replaced by pas  which is expected to be launched in the second quarter of of the satellites owned by panamsat that were constructed by boeing  three other satellites are the same model spacecraft as the affected satellites pas  pas and galaxy iiir 
both scps are functioning properly on these three spacecraft 
no assurance can be given that similar or additional scp failures will not occur 

battery cell failures pas and galaxy viii i have experienced battery cell failures 
in  insurance claims were filed for pas and galaxy viii i 
pas was declared a total loss and insurance proceeds were recovered 
galaxy viii i was declared a partial loss and insurance proceeds were recovered 
the battery s sole purpose is to power the payload and spacecraft operations during the daily eclipse periods  having a duration of one minute to a maximum of minutes per day  which occur during two day periods around each of march and september the manufacturer of the satellites  boeing  conducted an extensive analysis of the battery data and concluded that the nature of the battery problem is such that slow degradation of the battery cells may occur during normal battery management procedures 
panamsat has adopted a battery management strategy during eclipse seasons intended to manage any future problems with battery cells 
there can be no assurance that additional battery cell failures will not occur in future eclipse seasons 

propulsion system failures the galaxy viii i satellite has experienced difficulties with its xenon ion propulsion system  an electronic propulsion system that is used to maintain the spacecraft s proper orbit and attitude 
the satellite is operating normally on its backup chemical propulsion system 
without the use of xips  the spacecraft is expected to reach its end of life in late ten years earlier than originally forecast 
the company s ongoing satellite deployment plan is expected to provide for continuous service for the galaxy viii i customer with the scheduled launch of the galaxy iiic satellite into the same orbital location as galaxy viii i during the third quarter of and the construction of galaxy viii ir 
panamsat operates five other boeing hp spacecraft and two boeing spacecraft that use xips 
by the end of  panamsat plans to launch one additional boeing hp spacecraft and one additional boeing spacecraft  each of which uses xips 
the boeing s use a different xips system 
based on the information furnished to the company by boeing  the manufacturer of the xips equipped satellite  and panamsat s experience with xips  panamsat believes this difficulty on galaxy viii i is an incident that will not affect the performance of xips on its other spacecraft 
there can be no assurance that similar xips failures or failures of other propulsion systems on the company s satellites will not occur in the future 
risks relating to the continued growth in the use of the internet 
to support the company s anticipated growth resulting from internet and video and audio transmissions using formats compatible with the internet  the internet s recent and rapid growth must continue and the demand for internet based services must continue to grow 
this growth cannot be assured 
the internet may not continue to grow or prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  such as 
lack of acceptable security technologies  
lack of easy access and use by customers  
lack of commercial viability of e commerce and other internet applications or businesses  
congested traffic  
inconsistent quality of service  
lack of cost effective  high speed service  
inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  
excessive governmental regulation  and 
uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership 
risks relating to changes in technology 
technological changes in the telecommunications industry could undermine the company s competitive position or make the company s satellite systems obsolete 
the telecommunications industry continues to experience substantial technological innovations 
panamsat believes that there are many telecommunications companies that are seeking ways to improve the ability of existing non satellite infrastructure  such as fiber optic cable  to transmit signals 
any significant improvement or increase in the amount of non satellite capacity  particularly with respect to the existing fiber optic cable infrastructure  may cause the company s telecommunications services customers to shift their transmissions to non satellite capacity or make it more difficult for the company to obtain new customers 
if fiber optic cable networks or other ground based high capacity transmission systems are available to service a particular point  that capacity  when available  is generally less expensive than satellite capacity 
particular technological developments that could adversely affect the company include 
the development by competitors of new satellites with greater power  greater capabilities or more transponders  which would create more satellite capacity at lower costs  and 
continuing improvements in fiber optic cable technology and the continuing establishment of widespread fiber optic cable infrastructures  which would lead to more non satellite capacity at lower costs 
risks of government regulation 
panamsat is subject to the regulatory authority of the us government  primarily the federal communications commission  and the national communications authorities of the countries in which it operates 
if panamsat does not obtain all requisite regulatory approvals for the construction  launch and operation of any of panamsat s future satellites and for the orbital slots planned for these satellites or  the licenses obtained impose operational restrictions on panamsat  panamsat s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that panamsat will succeed in coordinating any or all of its future satellites internationally 
the risks of government regulation include 
some orbital slot designations may change or expire following the failure of galaxy iv  the fcc granted the company special temporary authority to relocate galaxy vi from degrees wl to degrees wl to provide replacement c band capacity 
in addition  the company has received special temporary authority to relocate brasilsat a from degrees wl to degrees wl and to operate brasilsat a at the new orbital location 
no assurance can be given that the company s orbital slots granted under temporary authority will be renewed in the future 
the fcc also reserves the right to require satellites to be re located to a different orbital location if it determines that re location is in the public interest 
in addition  if the company does not meet certain fcc due diligence requirements or does not place a satellite in service in an orbital slot by a specified deadline  the company s rights to such orbital slot may be subject to revocation or expiration 
for example  in  the fcc revoked two authorizations for the company to operate in ka band slots 
panamsat has filed an application for review requesting the fcc to reconsider such revocations 

replacement satellites and expanded frequency coverage are subject to regulatory approval some of the company s planned satellites are intended as replacements for the company s current satellites 
there can be no assurance that these planned replacement satellites will be able to occupy their proposed orbital location 
generally  the fcc gives a replacement expectancy with respect to the use of the same orbital location at the same frequencies for replacement satellites 
the grant of a replacement expectancy may increase the likelihood that panamsat will be able to use its replacement satellite to expand the frequencies or coverages employed by the predecessors  however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful at expanding such frequencies and coverages 

the us government may limit the use of us launch providers all of panamsat s planned launches are currently scheduled to occur on launch providers that are wholly or partly foreign owned 
while the us government has recently removed quota limitations on the launch of us manufactured satellites on russian launch vehicles including the proton  on which pas is scheduled to be launched  there can be no assurance that the united states will not place new limitations on the use of non us launch providers 
in addition  technical discussions between us satellite manufacturers and foreign launch providers are subject to us export restrictions 
the imposition of any new limitations or restrictions could result in launch delays or increased launch costs for panamsat 

use and coverage areas of satellite frequencies are regulated certain of the ku band downlink beams on pas include coverage  at very low power levels  of the west coast of the united states and of hawaii 
because the ku band frequencies on these beams are allocated in the united states to the broadcast satellite services frequency band bss  panamsat s coverage of the united states is on a non conforming use basis  requiring that panamsat not interfere with  and accept interference from  any authorized users in the united states 
if panamsat s efforts to resolve issues relating to this non conforming use status are not successful  panamsat may not be able to operate these satellite frequencies as intended 

some satellite frequencies must be coordinated individually with the government certain of the frequencies that are intended to be used to uplink to pas r  pas  pas  pas b  galaxy xi  galaxy viii i and galaxy iii c must be coordinated with the us government on an earth station by earth station basis to ensure that harmful interference to government operations is minimized 
although panamsat has undertaken such coordination and believes that it will either be able to coordinate successfully with federal government users or to institute operational solutions that will mitigate the problem  its failure to do so may make it impossible to operate these satellites as planned 
panamsat s successful deployment of its satellites depends upon the company s ability to obtain regulatory authorization to operate its satellites at certain locations 
if panamsat does not obtain all of the authorizations necessary to complete its satellite deployment plan on schedule  its business prospects could be materially adversely affected 
risks of doing business internationally 
panamsat  its customers or companies with which panamsat does business must have authority from each country in which panamsat provides services or its customers use its satellites 
the failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to operate its satellites internationally could have a material adverse effect on panamsat s business 
the risks of doing business internationally include 
new or changes in law or policies the company could be adversely affected by new laws  regulations  policies or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  regulations or policies that modify the present regulatory environment 
for instance  the governments of china  india and pakistan have notified the company that they separately intend to impose withholding tax on payments to the company for providing satellite services to china  india and pakistan  respectively 
the company believes that the payments are exempt from chinese  indian and pakistani taxation under the united states china income tax treaty  the united states india income tax treaty and the united states pakistan income tax treaty  respectively  and  therefore  has taken measures to contest the imposition of such withholding taxes 
even if the withholding taxes were imposed and upheld  the company believes its customers would be contractually responsible for the payment of such taxes and the company would be entitled to full payment  without deduction for any such taxes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to contest the imposition of such taxes by the governments of china  india and pakistan 
if other governments decide to adopt similar policies  the operations and business of the company could be materially adversely affected 

local non us regulatory schemes panamsat believes that it presently holds the requisite licenses and approvals for the countries in which it currently operates  although panamsat does not have all requisite licenses in certain countries in which it wishes to operate 
the regulatory schemes in each country  however  are different 
as a result  there may be non us governmental regulations of which panamsat is not aware 
further  portions of panamsat s present and future satellites are designed to provide service to countries in which regulatory impediments exist 
there can be no assurance that any current regulatory approvals held by panamsat are  or will remain  sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that any additional necessary approvals will be granted on a timely basis  or at all  in all jurisdictions in which the company wishes to operate its new satellites or that applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions will not be unduly burdensome 
in addition  the company has limited authorization from the russian federation for pas to operate its c band transponders 
risk of uninsured loss 
although the company obtains launch insurance policies designed to cover the cost to construct  launch and insure replacement satellites  there is a risk that certain losses may not be covered by the company s policies 
typically  panamsat s launch policies are effective for a period ranging between three and five years from the date of a satellite launch 
during that time  if a covered malfunction occurs  but no loss is incurred until after the expiration of the policy  the launch insurance policy will not cover the loss  and a subsequent in orbit policy obtained may either exclude losses related to the known event or impose deductibles that exceed the loss associated with the event 
in addition  panamsat does not generally obtain insurance to cover the risk of revenues lost as a result of satellite malfunctions 
there is a risk that certain losses relating to the in orbit failure of the company s satellites may not be covered by the company s in orbit insurance policies 
panamsat generally obtains in orbit insurance policies in an initial amount approximately equal to the unamortized construction  launch and insurance costs of its satellites 
coverage under such in orbit policies typically commences upon the expiration of the applicable launch insurance policy and runs for various periods ranging from one to three years thereafter 
during that time  if a covered malfunction occurs  but no loss is incurred until after the expiration of the policy  the in orbit insurance policy will not cover the loss  and a subsequent renewal policy obtained may either exclude losses related to the known event or impose deductibles that exceed the loss associated with the event 
in addition  panamsat does not generally obtain in orbit insurance to cover the risk of revenues lost as a result of satellite malfunctions 
as of december   panamsat s satellites had a net book value of approximately billion including certain sales type lease receivables and warranty liabilities related to transponders sold outright 
the book value of the satellites that were either self insured or had some health exclusion at that time was approximately million 
under the terms of its new master in orbit policy  which commenced december   several satellites that have existing technical anomalies will have certain coverage exclusions when they attach to the master policy in may they are currently covered without exclusions under existing in orbit policies 
when these satellites attach to the new policy  the book value of satellites that will have certain exclusions related to their coverage will be approximately million 
additionally  at that time  the book value of the self insured satellites will be approximately million 
the primary subject of the exclusion is the satellite control processor on the four satellites in this category 
one of them pas is operating on its backup scp as a result of the failure of the primary scp in november this satellite is scheduled to be replaced by pas  which is scheduled for launch in the second quarter of the other three satellites with scp exclusions pas  pas r  and galaxy iiir have both scps functioning properly today 
the loss of any of these satellites without insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
risks associated with net net will rely on panamsat s existing and future satellite network 
net will utilize panamsat s satellites  and will be subject to all of the risks described above 
furthermore  panamsat has allocated up to ku band transponders for use by net the availability of these transponders assumes that panamsat s existing satellites do not suffer any material in orbit failures and that future launches are timely and successful 
any delays or failures of panamsat satellites could adversely affect the availability of satellite coverage for net net will be deployed in complex environments and is dependent on integrating various new and existing technologies into a seamless network 
as a result  during its initial commercial deployment  the network may suffer technical problems due to integrating the various technologies 
if these technical problems occur  the deployment of net services could be delayed and the company may incur additional expenses and may not achieve anticipated revenues 
the successful deployment of net depends on panamsat s ability to establish relationships with third parties for the use and ownership of technology and the right to deploy equipment at isps and other locations 
the company will need to deploy its servers in the facilities of isps and others  including cable headends and dsl points of presence 
panamsat has entered into and must continue to enter into relationships with other technology providers in order to successfully roll out net there can be no assurance that panamsat will be able to enter into additional relationships with technology providers or isps on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that these relationships will allow panamsat to achieve its intended objectives 
the success of net is dependent upon the growth of available  last mile broadband capacity for internet end users  such as dsl  cable television  fiber optic cable and fixed wireless systems and its use by internet end users 
no assurance can be given that this growth will occur or that internet end users will purchase the broadband capacity consistent with panamsat s expectations 
the success of net also depends on market acceptance of the services that panamsat intends to offer over its network 
net is still in its infancy and has yet to attain revenue producing customers 
the market for its services is new and unproven and its services may not achieve widespread market acceptance 
panamsat believes that new and existing internet content providers  such as data and video customers of panamsat  and internet end users will purchase the services offered by net there can be no assurance  however  that such content providers or internet end users will purchase the services offered by net in the quantity or on the terms that panamsat expects 
in addition  new and existing content providers and internet end users may require features and capabilities that net does not have 
to achieve market acceptance of net  panamsat must effectively anticipate and adapt to the requirements and demands of content providers and internet end users 
failure of panamsat to meet these demands may result in delays  additional expense and the failure to achieve anticipated revenues 
the market for internet broadcasting of high bandwidth content is new  intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
the company expects that competition will increase and that many of net s competitors may not yet have entered the market 
many of net s competitors and potential competitors may have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  greater financial resources and larger customer bases 
increased and existing competition could result in high barriers to market entry  price reductions  fewer customer orders and the inability to gain market share  any of which would cause the projected operating results of the net business to suffer 
risks of inadequate access to capital for growth 
panamsat may not be able to raise adequate capital to complete some or all of its business strategies or to react rapidly to changes in technology  products  services or the competitive landscape 
industry participants often face high capital requirements in order to take advantage of new market opportunities  respond to rigorous competitive pressures and react quickly to changes in technology 
panamsat expects the global satellite based communications services market to continue to grow due to the high demand for communications infrastructure and the opportunities created by industry deregulation 
many of panamsat s competitors are committing substantial capital and  in many instances  are forming alliances to acquire or maintain market leadership 
panamsat s satellite deployment plan as well as its net business will require substantial investments of capital over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to satisfy its capital requirements in the future
