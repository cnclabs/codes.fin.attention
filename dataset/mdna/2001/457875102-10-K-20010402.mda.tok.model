the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed or implied herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results above 
among these risks are conducting business pursuant to the purchase agreement method of sale  changes in the market value of salvage  fluctuations in the actual cash value of salvage vehicles  the ability to successfully renegotiate existing purchase agreement contracts  the quality and quantity of inventory available from suppliers  competition  the ability to pass through increased towing costs  dependence on key insurance company suppliers  delays or changes in state title processing  general weather conditions  legislative or regulatory acts  that vehicle processing time will improve  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the ability to bring new facilities to expected earnings targets  that the company s towing business will reach forecasted levels of profitability and the level of energy and labor costs 
overview the company offers insurance companies and other vehicle suppliers cost effective salvage processing solutions through a variety of different methods of sale  including percentage of sale consignment  fixed fee consignment  and purchase agreement 
under the percentage of sale consignment and fixed fee sales methods  the vehicle is not owned by the company and only the fees associated with the processing and sale of the vehicle are recorded in net sales 
the percentage of sale consignment method offers potentially increased profits over fixed fee consignment by providing incentive to both the company and the salvage provider to invest in vehicle enhancements thereby maximizing the vehicle selling prices 
under the purchase agreement sales method  the vehicle is owned by the company and the sales price of the vehicle is recorded in revenue 
by assuming some of the risk inherent in owning the salvage vehicle instead of selling on a consignment basis  the company is potentially able to increase profits by improving the value of the salvage vehicle prior to the sale 
under the purchase agreement method  iaa generally pays the insurance company a pre determined percentage of the acv to purchase the vehicle 
acvs are the estimated pre accident fair value of a vehicle  adjusted for additional equipment  mileage and other factors 
because the company s purchase price is fixed by contract  changes in acvs or in the market or auction prices for salvage vehicles have an impact on the profitability of the sale of vehicles under the purchase agreement method 
however  if increases in used car prices and acvs are not associated with a corresponding increase in prices at salvage auctions  there can be a negative impact on the profitability of purchase agreement sales 
to mitigate these risks  the company has adjustment and risk sharing clauses in its standard purchase agreement contracts designed to provide some protection to the company and its customers from certain unexpected  significant changes in the acv salvage price relationship 
the company began renegotiating many of its purchase agreement contracts in and continued this process in the company seeks to renegotiate certain others in the company has added adjustment and risk sharing clauses to its new standard purchase agreement contracts designed to provide some protection to the company and its customers from certain unexpected  significant changes in the acv salvage price relationship 
these renegotiated agreements  although less profitable in some cases than the purchase agreements they replace  help to provide the company with a more stable revenue from quarter to quarter 
since its initial public offering  the company has grown primarily through a series of acquisitions to now include locations as of february  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations  including quarterly fluctuations  that can result from a number of factors  some of which are more significant for sales under the purchase agreement method
