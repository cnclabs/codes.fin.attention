item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general medtox scientific  inc formerly editek  inc  a delaware corporation  was organized in september to succeed the operations of a predecessor california corporation 
medtox scientific  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  medtox laboratories  inc and medtox diagnostics  inc  are referred to herein as the company 
the company is engaged primarily in two distinct  but very much related businesses 
the business of manufacturing and distribution of diagnostic devices is carried on by medtox diagnostics  inc from its facility in burlington  north carolina and the business of forensic and clinical laboratory services is conducted by medtox laboratories  inc at its facility in st 
paul  minnesota 
the company has two reportable segments laboratory services conducted by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  medtox laboratories  inc and products sales conducted by the company s wholly owned subsidiary medtox diagnostics  inc laboratory services include forensic toxicology  clinical toxicology  and heavy metal analyses as well as logistics  data  and overall program management services 
product sales include sales of a variety of on site screening products and contract manufacturing 
for the years ended december   and  laboratory services revenue accounted for  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
revenue from product sales accounted for  and of the total revenues of the company for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations in  the company achieved record revenues of million  an increase of over  driven by the continued growth of the verdict r and profile r product lines and an increase in the number of laboratory tests 
however  a one time charge to earnings of million related to reorganization of the company s laboratory services segment  a million charge to reserve for potential losses attributable to the chapter bankruptcy filings of two customers included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  coupled with higher than anticipated operating costs resulted in a net loss of million for the year ended december  the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenues cost of revenues operating expenses selling  general  and administrative research and development restructuring costs interest expense net loss income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million in  driven by a million  or increase in product sales revenues and a million  or increase in laboratory services revenues 
the growth in laboratory services revenues was primarily due to a increase in laboratory tests for employment drug testing services  partially offset by a decline in the average price per testing specimen 
the erosion in the average price per testing specimen stemmed from tougher market conditions  which reduced the average price that the company could charge new customers 
despite the overall favorable sales trend  poor weather conditions and a slowing economy in the fourth quarter of resulted in lab sample volume from existing drugs of abuse clients to fall well below expectations 
as a result  the company has undertaken a reorganization  which includes refocusing the laboratory operations to ensure that it operates with acceptable gross margins and targets appropriate markets 
as part of the reorganization  the company will emphasize the marketing  sales and operations of the product sales business rather than laboratory drugs of abuse screening 
this includes converting where possible the drugs of abuse laboratory clients to the profile r ii system for on site screening 
as more of the drugs of abuse screening converts away from the laboratory to the product sales business  the company will continue to expand and grow the esoteric laboratory business  which accounted for of laboratory revenues and grew by in this is especially true in the occupational health area and in the company s support of pharmaceutical trials 
the product sales segment achieved higher sales due to increased sales of substance abuse testing products and contract manufacturing services  partially offset by decreased sales of agricultural diagnostic products 
product sales from substance abuse testing products  which incorporates the ez screen r  profile r ii and verdict r ii on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased million to million in this growth reflected the sales and marketing efforts for the company s second generation test kits  profile r ii and verdict r ii 
the verdict r ii was developed for the prison  probation  parole and rehabilitation markets 
the verdict r ii product line now consists of different configurations to detect from one to five drugs of abuse 
with the expansion of the sales group and additional device configurations  the company expects significant growth of verdict r ii sales in the company continues to develop new products in this area  including the profile r er device which will be introduced in early the profile r er device is an on site  nine drugs of abuse panel  targeted at hospital laboratories for emergency response screening in drugs of abuse overdose situations 
the company received fda approval for its profile r er device and for configurations of its verdict r ii product in january sales of contract manufacturing services  microbiological and associated products increased to million due to increased revenues from both historical customers and new customers 
product sales from agricultural diagnostic products decreased to 
million primarily as a result of decreased purchases by the usda for the company s products 
the usda s needs for the company s products vary from year to year and sales to the usda are expected to fluctuate accordingly 
gross profit consolidated gross margin of in remained flat compared to  reflecting improvement in product sales gross margin  offset by a decline in laboratory services gross margin 
laboratory services gross margin was in  down from in the erosion of the gross margin was primarily attributable to a decline in the average price per testing specimen 
the drop in the average price per testing specimen stemmed from competitive market conditions  which restricted the average price that the company could charge new customers 
gross margin was also impacted by an increase in the company s employee health insurance costs 
gross margin from product sales improved from to in  driven by an increased mix of higher margin products and efficiencies gained at the production facility 
the company anticipates that accelerating both the sales efforts and converting drugs of abuse laboratory testing to the profile r ii on site testing system should have a significant positive impact on the company s consolidated gross margin in however  the company remains vulnerable to any major overall economic downturn  such as the one experienced in the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues in  compared to million or of revenues in the increase  in both the absolute amount and percentage of revenues  was primarily the result of the buildup of the company s sales and marketing group throughout  which affected both the laboratory services and the product sales segments 
while this effort impacted earnings in  the company anticipates a fully staffed sales and marketing group for all of  without any significant additional increase in expenses 
the company also incurred a one time charge of million related to the reorganization of its laboratory operations 
the charge primarily represented severance and other costs associated with certain management changes 
additionally  the company recorded a million charge to reserve for potential losses attributable to the chapter bankruptcy filings of two laboratory services customers 
both customers remain as clients  and subsequent to bankruptcy filings  are current on their obligations to the company 
the company does not anticipate that these charges will negatively impact revenues or earnings in the increase in the absolute dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses also reflected the higher revenue level in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  in  principally due to higher research and development expenses associated with new product development for on site and other ancillary products in the product sales segment 
interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  in  reflecting higher debt levels and increasing interest rates see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net loss income in  the company recorded a net loss of million compared to net income of million in  reflecting higher overall operating costs and a reduced gross margin in the laboratory services segment  partially offset by higher revenues in both the product sales and laboratory services segments 
laboratory services reported a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in the decline was primarily due to increased selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the buildup of the company s sales and marketing group  the reorganization of laboratory operations and the chapter bankruptcy of two customers 
although revenues increased  this improvement was offset by a reduced gross margin  which was impacted by a reduction in the average price per specimen and an increase in the company s employee health insurance costs 
product sales net income was million in compared to a net loss of  in this improvement was attributable to the growth in sales and an improved gross margin  which was driven by an increased mix of higher margin products and efficiencies gained at the production facility

revenues from product sales increased to million in  reflecting significant growth in sales of the profile r ii and verdict r ii on site testing kits 
revenues from product sales were also favorably impacted by increased sales of agricultural diagnostic products and contract manufacturing services  microbiological and associated products 
gross profit gross margin improved to in from in this improvement was driven by an increase in laboratory services gross margin of and a increase in product sales gross margin 
laboratory services gross margin improved primarily due to cost savings and improvements in the efficiency of laboratory operations  which more than offset an decrease in average per unit prices 
gross margin from product sales was positively impacted by the substantial increase in overall sales of products with a higher gross margin  particularly the substance abuse testing products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues in  compared to million or of revenues in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the company s efforts to reduce and monitor operating costs 
this decrease was partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses within the product sales segment as a result of implementation costs associated with the introduction and sale of the company s new generation on site products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased million  or  in laboratory services research and development expenses declined million or primarily due to a reduction in the number of laboratory based assays being developed in compared to product sales research and development expenses decreased million or  reflecting the completion of a significant portion of the development costs associated with the company s new generation of on site products 
restructuring costs the company used million of its restructuring reserve in  which reduced the remaining balance of this reserve to million as of december  the reduction in the restructuring reserve was due to payments of million and a decrease in the reserve by an additional million  as a result of the settlement of certain litigation brought against the company for less than the company had previously accrued for in the million adjustment was recorded as a reduction in restructuring costs

liquidity and capital resources the working capital requirements of the company have been funded primarily by cash received from bank financing and the sale of equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in net cash used in operating activities was million in the decrease of million in was primarily due to a million net loss  as well as higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by increased accrued expenses and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts increased million  or to million at december   primarily due to a significant increase in product sales revenues in the fourth quarter of over the corresponding quarter of  as well as the impact of a slowing economy in the laboratory services business 
inventories increased million  or  to million at december   principally to support the higher production levels of substance abuse testing products related to the year over year increase in sales within the product sales segment 
the increased inventory level also resulted from additional supplies forms  labels  and collection kits shipped to new and existing collection sites to support a projected increase in sales volume for within the laboratory services segment 
in  the company also revised its assumptions for calculating off site inventory located at collection sites throughout the united states 
the revised assumptions reduced the amount of expected scrap inventory and changed the projected time that a collection site uses the collection kits from three months to twelve months 
accrued expenses were million at december   up million from  primarily related to the reorganization of the laboratory operations and an increase in the company s employee health insurance costs 
the increase of million in the provision for doubtful accounts in was primarily related to a million reserve established in connection with the bankruptcy filings of two laboratory services customers 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the company s investing activities consisted primarily of equipment and capital improvement expenditures 
the increased spending for equipment and capital improvement expenditures in reflected purchases primarily for laboratory services to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs 
the company expects equipment and capital improvement expenditures to be between million and million in these expenditures are intended primarily to continue to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs within the laboratory services and product sales businesses 
such expenditures are expected to be funded through borrowings under the company s credit facilities and profitable operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in  the company completed a private equity placement through the sale  exclusively to accredited investors  of  units at an aggregate price of million  or per unit  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting agents commissions of million and other expenses 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one additional share of common stock at an exercise price of 
in january  the company entered into a credit security agreement the wells fargo credit agreement with wells fargo business credit wells fargo 
the wells fargo credit agreement  as amended  consists of i a term loan of million bearing interest at prime  ii an overadvance term loan of 
million bearing interest at prime  iii a revolving line of credit  payable on demand  of not more than million or of the company s eligible trade accounts receivable bearing interest at prime  and iv a capex note of up to million for the purchase of capital equipment bearing interest at prime 
the wells fargo credit agreement requires the company to comply with certain covenants and maintain certain quarterly financial ratios as to minimum debt service coverage and maximum debt to book net worth 
it also sets minimum quarterly net income and book net worth levels  which restrict the payment of dividends 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with the minimum debt service coverage and minimum quarterly net income level covenants of the wells fargo credit agreement 
wells fargo has waived the aforementioned defaults of the company 
the company has received a total of  from private placements of subordinated debt and warrants from through the notes require payment of the principal amounts on december  interest at per annum is paid semi annually on june and december in connection with the issuance of the subordinated notes  the company issued warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to of the face amount of the subordinated notes divided by an exercise price of per share 
the company has determined the value of the warrants at the dates of the grants to be  based upon the black scholes option pricing model 
the value of the warrants has been accounted for as additional paid in capital and deducted from the principal of the subordinated notes as discount on debt issued 
the company is relying on expected positive cash flow from operations and its line of credit to fund its future working capital and asset purchases 
the amount of credit on the revolving line of credit is based primarily on the receivables of the company and  as such  varies with the accounts receivable  and to a lesser degree  the inventory of the company 
as of december   the company had total borrowing capacity of million on its line of credit  of which million was borrowed  leaving a net availability of million as of december  in the short term  the company believes that the aforementioned capital will be sufficient to fund the company s planned operations through while there can be no assurance that the available capital will be sufficient to fund the future operations of the company beyond  the company believes that future profitable operations  as well as access to additional capital through debt or equity financings  will be the primary means for funding the operations of the company for the long term 
the company continues to follow a plan which includes i aggressively monitoring and controlling costs  ii increasing revenue from sales of the company s existing products and services iii developing new products and services  as well as iv continuing to selectively pursue synergistic acquisitions to increase the company s critical mass 
however  there can be no assurance that costs can be controlled  revenues can be increased  financing may be obtained  acquisitions successfully consummated  or that the company will be profitable 
impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices on the company has been primarily limited to salary  laboratory and operating supplies and rent increases and has not been material to date to the company s operations 
in the future  the company may not be able to increase the prices of laboratory testing by an amount sufficient to cover the cost of inflation  although the company is responding to these concerns by refocusing the laboratory operations towards higher margin testing including clinical and pharmaceutical trials as well as emphasizing the marketing  sales and operations of the product sales business 
seasonality the company believes that the laboratory testing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in pre employment screening 
these seasonal fluctuations include reduced volume in the summer months  year end holiday periods  and other major holidays 
in addition  inclement weather may have a negative impact on volume thereby reducing net revenues and cash flow
