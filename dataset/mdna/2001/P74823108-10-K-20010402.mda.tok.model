item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion addresses the financial condition and results of operations of panamco and its consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  including the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
in  panamco central america group was created  which consists of panamco costa rica  panamco nicaragua and panamco guatemala 
the financial condition and results of operations of these three companies have been reported together in the financial statements of panamco central america 
in february  north latin american division was created  which consists of panamco mexico and panamco central america 
we will continue to report these results of operations separately 
unit case means ounces of finished beverage product eight ounce servings 
average sales prices per unit case means net sales in us dollars for the period divided by the number of unit cases sold during the same period 
cash operating profit means operating income plus depreciation and amortization of goodwill and noncash facilities reorganization charges 
inflation effect of inflation on financial information our net sales  and almost all operating costs  in each of mexico  brazil  colombia  venezuela  costa rica  nicaragua and guatemala  are denominated in the currency of such country 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation sfas  the financial statements of our subsidiaries are remeasured or translated into us dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowings and purchases of machinery and equipment are often made in us dollars 
during any period when the rate of inflation in a particular country exceeds the rate of devaluation of the local currency against the us dollar  all income statement amounts tend to be higher when translated into us dollars than would be the case in the absence of such an excess 
conversely  if devaluation exceeds inflation  income statement amounts tend to be lower when translated into us dollars 
the following table compares the rate of inflation  as measured by certain national consumer price indices in the seven countries  with the rate of devaluation for the periods shown year ended december  mexico inflation currency devaluation revaluation brazil inflation currency devaluation colombia inflation currency devaluation venezuela inflation currency devaluation costa rica inflation currency devaluation nicaragua inflation currency devaluation guatemala inflation currency devaluation revaluation inflation figures are based on the applicable consumer price index obtained from official local sources from each respective country and currency devaluation figures are based on official us dollar exchange rates at year end 
the level of inflation has a direct impact on the method used to translate the financial statements from the local currency to the reporting currency 
sfas provides that  in a highly inflationary economy defined as having cumulative inflation for the three year period preceding the balance sheet date of approximately or more  the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation is included in the determination of net income for the period and is distributed as gains or losses to the related income statement accounts 
such gains and losses do not affect the income statement of companies operating in economies which are not considered highly inflationary but are instead included as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders equity 
beginning in  we discontinued classifying brazil as a highly inflationary economy and accordingly  the functional currency of our brazilian operations is the brazilian real 
costa rica  nicaragua and guatemala are not classified as highly inflationary economies and the functional currencies for financial reporting purposes under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are the colon  cordoba and quetzal  respectively 
colombia and venezuela are currently classified as highly inflationary economies and accordingly their financial statements have been remeasured into us dollars in accordance with sfas in and  mexico was classified as a highly inflationary economy 
since  mexico has not been classified as a highly inflationary economy and as a result the functional reporting currency for mexico since has been the mexican peso 
effect of inflation and changing prices on operations in addition to high inflation  our operations are carried out in countries which in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  government price controls 
while price controls have been a limiting factor  we have been generally effective in the recent past in increasing prices in local currency terms at least at the rate of inflation 
all of our costs are affected by inflation rates in the countries in which we operate 
in general  transactions in these countries are effectively tied to inflation either through pricing  contract indexing  statute or informal practice 
although currently there are no formal price controls on soft drinks in our franchise territories  price and wage controls remain in effect in mexico and brazil for certain other products and services  and price increases for soft drinks in mexico and colombia are subject to the informal approval of the respective governments 
our sales also have been  and may in the future be  adversely affected when wages rise more slowly than the rate of inflation  resulting in a loss of consumer purchasing power 
this has been the case in brazil  venezuela and colombia recently as a result of the devaluations as discussed above 
in mexico  brazil  colombia  venezuela  costa rica and nicaragua  income taxes are indexed to reflect the effects of inflation  however  the effects of inflation are calculated differently for purposes of local taxation and financial reporting 
seasonality all product sales are generally higher during the december holidays and during the hottest and driest periods with rainfall varying from year to year 
for this reason  we typically experience our best results of operations in the second and fourth quarters 
however  the seasonality effect is tempered in our case because of the difference in the timing of the summer months in the countries in which we operate 
in brazil  summer occurs during november  december and january  while summer occurs in mexico  colombia  venezuela  costa rica  guatemala and nicaragua during the months of june  july and august 
forward looking statements the nature of our operations and the environment in which we operate subject us to changing economic  competitive  regulatory and technological conditions  risks and uncertainties

such statements  estimates  and projections reflect various assumptions by our management  concerning anticipated results and are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could cause results to differ include  but are not limited to  changes in the soft drink business environment  including actions of competitors and changes in consumer preference  changes in governmental laws and regulations  including income taxes  market demand for new and existing products  raw material prices and devaluation of local currencies against the us dollar

consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth our selected consolidated financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and distribution general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of goodwill facilities reorganization charges total operating income loss interest expense  net other income expense  net nonrecurring income  net income loss before income taxe income taxes income loss before minority interest minority interest net income loss minority interests in results of operations we conduct our operations through tiers of subsidiaries in which  in some cases  minority shareholders hold interests 
the aggregate minority interest in our income before minority interest during a fiscal period is a function of the relative levels of income generated by each of the consolidated subsidiaries and the percentage of each subsidiary s capital stock owned by minority shareholders 
as of december   our ownership interests in our mexican  brazilian and colombian holding companies were approximately  and  respectively 
our ownership interests include acquisitions made in and that increased our effective ownership interest in panamco mexico  from to and in panamco brasil from to 
we own of our operations in costa rica  venezuela  nicaragua and guatemala 
our country level holding companies own interests ranging from to in our approximately consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result of the net loss at certain of our subsidiaries for the year ended december   minority shareholdings in our consolidated subsidiaries represented an interest in the aggregate of approximately of consolidated net loss before minority interest 
because we have varying percentage ownership interests in our approximately consolidated subsidiaries  the amount of the minority interest in income or loss before minority interest during a period depends upon the revenues and expenses of each of the consolidated subsidiaries and the percentage of each of such subsidiary s capital stock owned by minority shareholders during such period

additionally  during the second quarter of  the coca cola company changed its cold equipment capital participation program to ensure that any funds received by us during and future years be recognized as income in installments over a month period 
our ability to include such amounts as income will also depend on whether we meet certain conditions in the future 
prior to the change  such amounts were included as income upon receipt  as no future conditions were required to be met 
the consolidated effective income tax rate increased to in from in the increase was due to tax benefits recorded in in brazil and colombia  which were not repeated in the period  the effect of the asset tax minimum tax in venezuela and our decision not to recognize the benefit of tax loss carryforwards from prior years in venezuela because of our uncertainty that we will have sufficient taxable income in the near term to offset against such benefits

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from 
although there was an increase in net sales  this was offset by higher selling and administrative costs  mainly attributable to increases in sales commissions and distribution and promotional expenses due to increased competition and increased depreciation expenses related to our continued capital expenditure program in mexico 
in  we spent million related mainly to strategic programs 
higher selling and administrative costs were due to the continued expansion of our meter program and cold equipment placement program 
operating income increased by to million and as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in cash operating profit increased to million in from million in net interest expense in increased by to million from million in due to the issuance of an aggregate of million in unsecured peso denominated promissory notes in november of in a local debt offering

beer volume increased to million unit cases from million unit cases in the prior year 
water volume increased to million unit cases and soft drink sales volume increased to million unit cases 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase is primarily attributable to the devaluation of the brazilian real discussed above  slightly offset by reductions in the cost of raw materials and increased direct sales to supermarkets by cervejarias kaiser in panamco brasil territories 
while panamco brasil records the commissions from the direct sales made by cervejarias kaiser to the supermarkets as net sales  this amount affects the percentage of cost of sales as a percentage of total sales 
operating expenses  including facilities reorganization charges  as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  due to higher promotional expenses related to the promotional pricing strategy put into effect during the facilities reorganization charges were related mainly to a workforce reduction of approximately  people due to the partial shutdown of one of our bottling plants during the year  and the streamlining of our operations 
operating income decreased by to million from million in due to lower sales 
cash operating profit decreased to million in from million in net interest expense decreased by to million in from million in as a result of improved financing conditions resulting in lower interest costs and repayment of short term debt

during  approximately      and of such expenditures were made by panamco mexico  panamco brasil  panamco colombia  panamco costa rica  panamco venezuela  panamco nicaragua and panamco guatemala  respectively 
the principal components of such capital expenditures during were o million for increasing production capacity  o million in company s fleet of vehicles  o million for coolers  vending and post mix equipment  o million in environmental facilities  and o million for operational and other purposes 
our board of directors has established various criteria for the allocation of capital resources 
the factors that management must review in proposing three year capital budgets include anticipated internal rates of return  pay back periods and eva r analysis from various investments  corresponding plans of the coca cola company and anticipated levels of earnings and debt in the country in which such expenditures are proposed to be made 
during  we estimate that we will have aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million 
of our estimated total capital expenditures for  we expect to spend approximately o million in mexico to upgrade our operating facilities  o million in brazil mainly for operational and replacement purposes  o million in colombia mainly for equipment used for marketing and environmental facilities  o million in venezuela to continue our program of strategic placement of cold storage equipment  and o million in our panamco central american franchises for equipment used for marketing and environmental facilities 
the foregoing estimates of capital expenditures are based on our current expectations and are subject to change 
actual costs may exceed estimates or we may reallocate or alter our capital budget 
we intend to fund our capital expenditure program with cash on hand  consolidated cash flow from operations and borrowings at the subsidiary level 
the coca cola company from time to time provides incentives for its bottlers to make particular types of capital expenditures 
during  and  such incentives consisted of grants which are included as other income in other income expense in the consolidated financial statements  and loans included in the indebtedness referred to above 
during the second quarter of  the coca cola company changed its cold equipment capital participation program to ensure that any funds received by us during and future years will be recognized as income in installments over a month period 
our ability to include such amounts as income will also depend on whether we meet certain conditions in the future 
prior to the change  such amounts were included as income upon receipt  as no future conditions were required to be met  without regard to our earnings 
see compared to consolidated results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the coca cola company also provides cooperative advertising support to us 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of compared to million as of december  our total consolidated indebtedness was  million at december  compared to  million at december  we have investments in bank deposits for million  which guarantee bank loans obtained by subsidiaries and are therefore classified as non current investments 
consolidated cash flow provided by operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
uses of funds for  and included purchases of minority interests  capital expenditures  bottling and packaging expenditures and payment of shareholder dividends 
purchases of minority interests were million in no material minority interests were purchased in and capital expenditures  as noted above  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we had expenditures for bottles and cases of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we paid dividends of million during and million during and dividends to minority shareholders in the consolidated subsidiaries paid during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
as a holding company  our principal sources of cash are dividends from our subsidiaries and sales of our securities 
the amount of dividends payable by the subsidiaries to us is subject to general limitations imposed by the corporate laws of the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of such subsidiaries 
dividends paid to us and other foreign shareholders by the subsidiaries are subject to investment registration requirements and withholding taxes 
withholding tax rates on dividends are currently in mexico  in colombia and in costa rica 
there are no withholding taxes on dividends paid by panamco brasil to the company out of income earned after december   and no withholding taxes on dividends paid by panamco nicaragua and panamco guatemala 
effective january   venezuela imposed a withholding tax on dividends that arose from earnings that have not been subject to the payment of income tax 
dividends from earnings generated until are not subject to income taxes in mexico  as long as they are paid from net taxed income ufin 
dividends not paid from ufin are subject to a income tax 
since  dividends paid to individuals or foreign residents are subject to income tax withholding of an effective tax rate of approximately 
if earnings generated after for which no corporate tax has been paid are distributed  the tax must be paid upon distribution of the dividends 
consequently  we must keep a record of earnings subject to each tax rate 
in the past  we have paid substantially all cash received as dividends from our subsidiaries  net of holding company expenses  to our shareholders and have not used such funds to make investments  primarily to avoid having undistributed foreign personal holding company income  which would be includable in the income of our shareholders who are united states persons 
we may  therefore  be substantially dependent in the future on sources of financing other than dividends from subsidiaries  including external sources  to finance holding company investments such as acquiring minority interests in our subsidiaries or acquiring additional bottling enterprises 
total consolidated indebtedness was  million as of december   consisting of million at the holding company level and million of subsidiary indebtedness 
substantially all of our total indebtedness is denominated in us dollars 
our practice is to enter into arrangements to hedge interest and currency exchange rate exposure where the terms of such arrangements are reasonable in relation to the exposure risks

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business exposes us to many different market risks  such as fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
consequently  we consider risk management as an essential activity in the course of our business 
we utilize hedging strategies to mitigate those risks 
our hedging strategies may include the use of derivative instruments  such as forwards  futures and options  generally with terms not exceeding one year 
all financial and hedging instruments held by the company are for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure generally relates to our debt obligations 
we manage our interest rate exposure by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
therefore  our exposure to an increase in interest rates results from our floating rate debt and our exposure to a decrease in interest rates relates to the financing costs associated with our fixed rate debt 
the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in this table  the fair value of long term debt shown is based on the quoted market prices  or  when quoted market prices were not available  the present value of future cash flows expected maturity date there after total fv total fv interest rate risk amounts in equivalent millions of us dollars fixed rate debt in us dollars weighted average interest rate in brazilian reals weighted average interest rate in guatemalan quetzals weighted average interest rate in costa rican colons weighted average interest rate floating rate debt in us dollars weighted average interest rate in colombian pesos weighted average interest rate in brazilian reals weighted average interest rate in japanese yen weighted average interest rate in mexican pesos weighted average interest rate total debt     less bank loans total long term debt fixed interest rates are weighted averages as contracted by us 
floating interest rates are based on market rates as of december   plus the weighted average spread for us 
fv fair value market interest rates are based on the us dollar libor curve 
market rates are based on the country benchmark or libor and assume a flat yield curve 
foreign exchange risk 
our currency exchange risk is generally related to the potential devaluation of the us dollar against the latin american currencies used in the countries in which we have operations 
in each country where we operate  our sales are in local currencies  while our debt is mostly in us dollars 
therefore  foreign currency exchange exposure relates primarily to our debt obligations in us dollars  which are shown in the previous interest rate risk table 
to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates fluctuations  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions in order to lock in the exchange rates for anticipated transactions 
as of december   the company had no foreign exchange forward contracts 
commodity price risk 
our largest exposure to commodity price fluctuations is for sugar 
as a risk management practice we may utilize both futures and options contracts to hedge against an increase in the price of sugar 
as of december   we did not hold any hedging position for sugar 
because inventories of sugar are of a short term nature  they are not included in this market risk disclosure
