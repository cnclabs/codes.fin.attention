item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of health improvement services in the united states 
as the largest pbm based on number of lives covered  we currently serve more than million health plan members and manage more than billion in prescription drug spending on an annualized basis on behalf of our health plan sponsors 
in addition  we offer a wide range of other health improvement products and services  such as prescription discount cards for the uninsured and under insured  web based programs  disease management  clinical trials and outcomes studies 
our mission is to improve the quality of care delivered to health plan members while helping health plan sponsors reduce overall costs 
over the past few years  the pbm industry has undergone significant consolidation 
we believe such consolidation has principally been driven by the significant benefits of size and scale  including cost saving opportunities to leverage a fixed cost infrastructure over greater prescription claim volume  resulting in greater pricing flexibility  and increased negotiating leverage with pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacies  resulting in greater ability to obtain lower drug costs for health plan sponsors 

table of contents we believe pbms that effectively capture these benefits will be positioned to strengthen their relationships with plan members  physicians and health plan sponsors and improve their competitive position 
acquisitions effective october   we completed the acquisition of pcs for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  of which we paid rite aid  the seller  million in cash  and issued to rite aid million in senior subordinated notes and million in our convertible preferred stock 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed with the proceeds of an million senior secured credit facility and million in equity financing committed by jll 
in connection with the equity financing  we issued to jll  shares of series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of  six shares of series b convertible preferred stock and  shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  on december   the six shares of series b convertible preferred stock and the  shares of class a common stock automatically converted into  shares of class b common stock 
in connection with the senior subordinated notes  we issued to rite aid warrants to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
the senior subordinated notes were fully redeemed on march  the warrants terminated upon repayment of the senior subordinated notes 
the acquisition of pcs was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the excess of the purchase price paid over the net identifiable assets and liabilities of pcs was recorded as goodwill 
effective july   we completed a merger with ffi 
we issued million shares of our class a common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of ffi 
the merger constituted a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the historical financial results have been restated in accordance with apb no 
to reflect the merger as though ffi had always been a part of advancepcs 
effective march   we completed the acquisition of foundation health pharmaceutical services for million in cash and warrants to purchase  shares of our class a common stock 
we valued such warrants at fair market value based upon the black scholes valuation model 
the acquisition of foundation health pharmaceutical services was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price was allocated to goodwill  certain customer contracts and other intangible assets 
effective december   we completed the acquisition of baumel eisner neuromedical institute  inc  a privately held clinical trial firm  for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
anticipated synergies related to pcs acquisition we anticipate being able to generate synergies as a result of the pcs acquisition by consolidating and renegotiating existing contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
a significant portion of our and pcs s contracts with manufacturers allow for increasingly favorable terms as volume increases 
we have reviewed overlapping contracts and plan to migrate combined volume to the contract with the best terms 
pbm contracts with manufacturers are generally not long term in nature  and we expect to be able to negotiate more favorable terms that reflect our increased purchasing power 
re contracting with our retail pharmacy network 
historically  pcs had not aggressively negotiated its contracts with retail pharmacies due to its ownership history  as discussed in results of operations pcs 
we believe we can increase profitability by renegotiating our contract terms with retailers in our network that reflect the independence  as well as the increased scale of our combined company 
rationalizing and gaining economies of scale in our mail service operations 
volume is an important component of profitability in the mail service business from both a fixed cost and purchasing power perspective 
we are consolidating the operations of our richardson  texas mail service pharmacy into our larger facilities in fort worth  texas and birmingham  alabama 
through this consolidation and resulting increased capacity utilization  we expect to realize significant cost savings 
in addition  we recently entered into a new contract with a wholesale pharmaceutical supplier for our mail facilities with more favorable terms that reflect our increased purchasing power 
generating corporate overhead and information technology efficiencies 
our combination with pcs puts us in a position to realize significant cost savings by generating corporate overhead and information technology efficiencies 
we expect cost savings to result from consolidation of corporate fixed costs and the utilization of best practices from both companies 
for example  we intend to relocate selected information systems to pcs s facilities in an effort to consolidate overhead and maximize efficiencies in this area 

table of contents pursuing cross selling opportunities with pharmaceutical manufacturers and health plan sponsors 
our acquisition of pcs provides us with a wider range of complementary products and services to sell to a larger customer base 
for example  we have historically offered outcomes research to our customers  which we will now be able to cross sell to traditional pcs customers 
likewise  pcs offers certain clinical programs and services that we have not previously provided to our customers 
integration related to pcs acquisition we have successfully completed most of the steps in integrating pcs that are necessary for us to operate as a single  combined company 
our combined organizational and management reporting structure has been rolled out and implemented at all levels of the organization 
we have completed the integration of the operational components of the call centers and mail pharmacies 
we have successfully completed an interface to all of our call centers and our mail service pharmacies so clients can be supported by any combination of these facilities 
in addition  we have completed the evaluation of vendor contracts  are reviewing and finalizing improved terms with our pharmaceutical wholesalers  technology vendors and others  and have completed the relocation of selected information systems to pcs facilities 
by the end of the quarter ending september   we expect to have completed the remaining steps in integrating pcs s operations  including the rollout of an interface between our data processing platforms  and a combination of other technology systems 
sources of revenue we group the revenues from all of our health improvement service offerings into three categories data  mail  and clinical services 
data services through our data services operations we process prescription claims on behalf of our health plan sponsor customers 
when a member of one of our health plan sponsors presents a prescription or health plan identification card to a retail pharmacist in our network  the pharmacist accesses our online system to receive information regarding eligibility  patient history  health plan formulary listings  and negotiated price 
the member generally pays a co pay to the retail pharmacy and the pharmacist fills the prescription 
on behalf of our health plan sponsors  during each billing cycle  our systems electronically aggregate pharmacy benefit claims  which include prescription costs plus our claims processing fees 
once we receive payments from health plan sponsors  we remit the amounts owed by those health plan sponsors to the retail pharmacies and keep the claims processing fees 
we have established a nationwide network of over  retail pharmacies  each of which pay an access fee to be included in our network 
our contracts with most of our health plan sponsors provide for member access to our retail pharmacy network 
under these contracts  we have an independent obligation to pay network retail pharmacies for the drugs dispensed  meaning we have assumed this risk 
we are a principal in the transaction  therefore  we record the aggregate pharmacy benefit claim payments from our health plan sponsors as revenues  and include prescription costs to be paid to retail pharmacies in cost of revenues 
some of our other customers have established their own pharmacy networks 
under contracts with these customers  we are not at risk for retail pharmacy payment obligations 
thus  we record only our claims processing fees as revenues and do not include prescription costs in revenues or cost of revenues 
as a result  customers that use our network will generate higher revenues than customers that use their own networks 
similarly  while a customer who uses our network may contribute the same gross profit in terms of dollars as a customer that uses its own network  gross profit as a percentage of revenue will be significantly lower for the customer using our network because of the higher level of revenue we recognize 
mail services we derive mail services revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals to members of our customers health plans 
these revenues include the cost of the pharmaceuticals plus a dispensing fee 
our cost of revenues includes product costs and other direct costs associated with the dispensing of prescription drugs 
clinical and other services we have historically derived our clinical revenues primarily from formulary management and administration of rebate and volume discount programs of pharmaceutical manufacturers relating to our pbm and consumer card operations 
we record revenues in the amount of the fees we charge for our services and include the cost of such services in cost of revenues 

table of contents some of these revenues are based on estimates of rebates generated for our clients that are subject to final settlement with the manufacturer 
in addition  we generate clinical revenues on a fee for service basis on the sale of our comprehensive health improvement products and services  including disease management  clinical trials and outcomes studies 
changes in revenue recognition we purchased pcs holding corporation  or pcs  on october  and have included this business in our consolidated results of operations since that time 
we made changes in our revenue recognition presentation to conform the different policies used by us and pcs 
these changes are reflected in all periods presented 
these changes are as follows the historical pcs amounts have been reclassified to reflect the change in presentation of data services revenues 
in cases in which we have assumed an independent obligation to pay our network pharmacy providers and acts as a principal in the transaction  we include payments from our plan sponsors for these benefits as revenues and payments to our pharmacy providers as cost of revenues ie gross reporting 
historically  pcs recorded only claims processing fees as revenues ie net reporting 
the change results in higher revenues and an equal increase in cost of revenues 
this change had no effect on gross profit or operating income 
in addition  the historical financial statements of advancepcs have been revised to reflect a change in recognition of clinical and other service revenues 
we receive funds from pharmaceutical manufacturers for formulary rebate programs that we administer on behalf of our health plan sponsors 
we record revenues in the amount of the administration fees we charge for our services ie net reporting and include the cost of such services in cost of revenues 
previously  we recognized the entire amount of the rebate  including our administration fee  in revenues and the portion of the rebate paid to our client in cost of revenues ie gross reporting 
this revision resulted in lower revenues and an equal decrease in cost of revenues 
this change had no effect on gross profit or operating income 
revenues from the dispensing of pharmaceuticals from the company s mail service pharmacies are recognized when each prescription is shipped 
revenues from the sales of prescription drugs by pharmacies in the company s nationwide network and claims processing fees are recognized when the claims are adjudicated 
at the point of sale  the pharmacy claims are adjudicated using the company s on line claims processing system 
when the company independently contracts to pay its network pharmacy providers  it assumes credit risk and acts as a principal in the transaction  the company includes payments from plan sponsors for these benefits as revenues and payments to its pharmacy providers as cost of revenues ie gross reporting in accordance with eitf reporting gross revenue as a principal vs net as an agent 
if the company is only administering plan sponsors network pharmacy contracts  the company records the claims processing fees as revenue ie net reporting 
clinical services fees received from the plan sponsors or pharmaceutical manufacturers are recognized in revenues as earned in accordance with the contractual agreements 
certain of the clinical service revenues are based on estimates  which are subject to final settlement with the contract party 
these estimates are reviewed and revised as settled 
rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of plan sponsors are excluded from revenues 
revenues from certain disease management and health benefit management products are reimbursed at predetermined contractual rates based on the achievement of certain milestones 
in december  the securities exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
in addition  the emerging issues task force eitf issued a consensus in eitf reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent 
the eitf also has issued eitf accounting for 
other volume based sales incentive offers 
this pronouncement provides accounting guidance for certain volume rebate programs 
sab and the eitfs were effective in our fourth fiscal quarter of in connection with our recent acquisitions and the issuance of these pronouncements  we have evaluated certain aspects of sab and the eitfs  including gross versus net reporting of data and clinical revenues 
net reporting of these revenues has no effect on gross profit or operating income 
if we had reported our data services revenues using net reporting  revenues and cost of revenues would have decreased by million  billion  and billion respectively  for the fiscal years ended march    and 
table of contents results of operations advancepcs the following table sets forth certain consolidated historical financial data of advancepcs 
historical revenues for advancepcs and pcs have been revised to reflect adoption of consistent revenue recognition policies as described above

claims processed increased from million in fiscal year to million for fiscal year the addition of pcs added approximately million claims for the period 
approximately of the increase was attributable to additional sales of our mail pharmacy services  resulting from a increase in the number of mail prescriptions dispensed 
mail pharmacy prescriptions dispensed increased from million in fiscal year to million for fiscal year the addition of pcs s two mail pharmacies accounted for approximately of the increase 
the remaining of the increase in revenues resulted from an increase in clinical and other services revenues derived from formulary and disease management services as well as clinical trials 
gross profit 
our gross profit for fiscal year increased by million  or  compared to the same period in fiscal year this increase was attributable primarily to the additional revenue and gross profit associated with the pcs acquisition 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit was approximately in fiscal year compared to in the same period in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a substantial increase in data services revenues from the pcs acquisition  which have lower margins than other services 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million  or  compared to the same period in fiscal year this increase is due to the acquisition of pcs 
approximately million of the increase is due to additional goodwill and other intangibles amortization associated with the pcs acquisition 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was approximately in fiscal year compared to in the same period in fiscal year non recurring and impairment charges 
net income for the year ended march  reflected a non recurring charge of   after taxes  or per diluted share representing an impairment related to the integration of the mail facility and advancepcs mail facilities 
our mail facility in richardson  texas will be closed and operations moved to the fort worth and birmingham facilities 
in addition  the charges include severance costs for certain management employees that were terminated or resigned following and as a result of the acquisition with pcs 
all of these severance costs to management employees were paid prior to march  we expect to consolidate certain additional operations in connection with the integration of pcs  which will result in future non recurring charges consisting primarily of facility closure  software abandonment  and severance costs in the year ended march  we anticipate these additional charges will be approximately to million 

table of contents interest income and interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  for fiscal year increased million compared to the same period in fiscal year the increase resulted from the acquisition of pcs  which was partially funded by over million in additional debt 
merger costs 
net income for fiscal year reflected a pre tax charge of million  after taxes  or per share relating to merger costs incurred in connection with the merger with ffi 
income taxes 
for fiscal year our effective tax rate was approximately 
for fiscal year our recorded income tax expense approximated an effective tax rate of 
the effective rate for fiscal year was higher due to the non deductible nature of the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the pcs acquisition 
diluted net income per share 
we reported diluted net income per share of per share for fiscal year compared to per share for the same period in fiscal year the weighted average shares outstanding were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in diluted net income per share resulted from additional interest expense and goodwill and other intangibles amortization in connection with the pcs acquisition 
in addition  securities convertible into common stock were issued in connection with the pcs acquisition resulting in an increase in weighted average shares outstanding 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues for fiscal year increased by billion  or  compared to revenues for fiscal year the number of individuals we managed continued to increase in fiscal year as we obtained new customers including our largest customer at that time  foundation health systems  inc  or fhs  whose service agreement began april  in addition  our current customers continued to increase their membership and utilization levels 
new customer contracts resulted from increased marketing efforts and the expansion of our sales and marketing department 
contracts with new customers in fiscal year generally included all pharmacy benefit management products we offer  including claims processing  mail and clinical and other services 
our revenues from data services increased billion  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase resulted from the addition of new contracts including the service agreement with fhs and an increase in the use of our services by existing customers 
the increase in new members resulted in an increase in pharmacy claims processed from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  a increase 
virtually all of the new fiscal year customer contracts  including fhs  use our pharmacy network  which has shifted a larger percentage of our total revenues to data services 
revenues from mail services increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from the new members added during fiscal year the increase in new members resulted in an increase in mail prescriptions dispensed from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  a increase

this increase primarily resulted from the additional costs associated with our claims processing growth and the new customers  including fhs that are using our retail pharmacy network 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general  and administrative expense for fiscal year increased by million  or  compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of foundation health pharmaceutical services  inc  or fhps  in march and the related amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired 
in addition  further expansion in management  sales and marketing contributed to the increase 
in spite of the increase  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year as the result of greater economies of scale and due to the increase in revenues associated with our claims processing services 
additional revenues generated by customers using our network pharmacy providers typically do not result in an increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
interest income and interest expense 
our interest expense  net of interest income was  for fiscal year we incurred no interest expense for fiscal year  since we had no outstanding indebtedness until march  and had million of interest income

gross profit 
our gross profit for fiscal year increased by million  or  compared to the same period in fiscal year on a pro forma basis 
this increase was attributable primarily to the additional revenue and gross profit generated by the improvement in operations at the two pcs mail facilities 
the improvement resulted from an overall decrease in headcount in the mail facilities and the call centers despite a growth in prescriptions filled 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit was approximately in fiscal year  compared to in the same period in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
our pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million  or  compared to the same period in fiscal year this increase resulted from increased support to cover the increased revenues 
also  losses of approximately million were incurred in connection with performance based contracts in fiscal year in addition  we incurred expenses for severance and retention costs related to executive employment agreements in fiscal year non recurring and impairment charges 
net income for the year ended march  reflected a non recurring charge of   after taxes  or per diluted share representing facility closure costs related to the combination of pcs and advance facilities 
the company s mail facility in richardson  texas will be closed and operations moved to the fort worth and birmingham facilities 
in addition  the charges include severance costs for certain management employees that were terminated or resigned following and as a result of the acquisition with pcs 
all of these severance costs to management employees were paid prior to march  we expect to consolidate certain additional operations in connection with the integration of pcs  which will result in additional non recurring charges consisting primarily of facility closure and severance costs in the year ended march  we anticipate these additional charges will be approximately to million 
operating income 
our operating income increased by million  or  for fiscal year compared to the same period in fiscal year on a pro forma basis 
the increase resulted from the factors mentioned above as revenues improved and pcs s headcount and costs declined 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had a working capital deficit of million 
the majority of our current obligations are not due until cash is collected from our customers 
we use our excess cash balances to reduce debt under our revolving credit facility  which results in a net deficit in working capital 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year resulting primarily from net income and also due to the timing of receivables and payables resulting from our continued growth 
during fiscal year  we used cash of million  or million on a pro forma basis  for purchases of property  plant and equipment associated with the growth and expansion of our systems and facilities 
historically  we have been able to fund our operations and continued growth through cash flow from operations 
in fiscal years   and our operating cash flow funded our capital expenditures and our short term excess cash was used to reduce our debt or invested in money market funds 
in conjunction with our acquisition of pcs  we obtained an million senior secured credit facility that includes a million revolving credit facility  million interim revolving credit facility and two term notes totaling million 
our million term a note accrues interest at libor plus  with escalating quarterly principal payments  and is due on september  our million term b note accrues interest at libor plus  with quarterly principal payments of million until december  and payments of million thereafter on each of december   march   june  and september  our revolving credit facilities accrue interest at libor plus 
these percentages may be lower based upon our total leverage 
the revolving credit facility expires on october  as of march   million was outstanding under this revolving credit facility 
we intend to refinance the million interim revolving credit facility with a collateralized accounts receivable facility in fiscal year the senior secured credit facility contains covenants that are typical for this type of document 
the senior secured credit facility has been unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by all of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the senior secured credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries 
each subsidiary is owned 
there are no restrictions on the ability of the subsidiary guarantors to pay dividends or make loans or advances to the parent 
we also issued to rite aid million in convertible preferred stock substantially all of which was subsequently converted into class a common stock and sold by rite aid 
in addition  we issued million in  shares of common stock and  shares of convertible preferred stock to jll 
also  we issued to rite aid million in senior subordinated notes 
in march  the company issued million in senior notes due senior notes 
the proceeds from this offering were used to retire the million senior subordinated notes due that were issued to rite aid in connection with the pcs acquisition 
the senior notes contain covenants that are typical for this type of debt 
the senior notes have been unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by all of our subsidiaries  which are all owned 
there are no restrictions on the ability of the guarantors to pay dividends  make loans or advances to the parent 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  combined with our current cash balances and amounts available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our internal operating requirements and expansion programs  including capital expenditures  for at least the next months 
however  if we successfully continue our expansion  acquisition and alliance plans  we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to achieve these plans 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  financial accounting standards board issued sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires all derivatives to be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measured at fair value 
in addition  sfas specifies the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  is effective beginning in fiscal year march  we have entered into interest rate protection agreements that have fixed the libor rate as of november  at for million of our variable rate debt under our credit facility 
the notional amount drops to million in october and to million in october we will declare these agreements hedges in accordance with sfas  as amended  and will recognize the fair value of these financial instruments on the balance sheet effective april  upon adoption of sfas these instruments will be marked to market at each reporting date with the adjustment recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
the fair value of our interest rate swaps  a liability of  at march   was based upon quoted market prices 
under sfas  we will record a transition liability of  and a charge to other comprehensive income loss as of april  in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

fin is intended to clarify the application of apb no 
by providing guidance regarding among other issues the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of the previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin was effective july  but certain provisions covered specific events occurring after december  or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
in addition  the eitf issued a consensus in eitf reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 

table of contents net as an agent 
sab and the eitf were effective in our fourth fiscal quarter of the adoption of sab and eitf had no material effect on our statement of operations 
in  the fasb issued an exposure draft for a proposed statement on business combinations and intangible assets new rules 
this exposure draft  among other things  eliminates pooling of interest business combinations  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and starts assessing goodwill on the impairment approach 
non calendar year end companies that have new fiscal years beginning after march   but before december   have a choice for date of adoption of the new rules 
march year end companies that issue first quarter financial statements before the new rules are issued will not be eligible for this choice 
during the first year of application of the new rules  companies will test for goodwill impairment at the transaction date 
management expects to adopt the new rules upon their final issuance prior to the release of the company s fiscal first quarter financial statements 
impact of inflation changes in prices charged by manufacturers and wholesalers for pharmaceuticals we dispense affect our cost of revenues 
historically  we have been able to pass the effect of such price changes to our customers under the terms of our agreements 
as a result  changes in pharmaceutical prices due to inflation have not adversely affected us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk is that of interest rate risk 
a change in libor or the prime rate as set by bank of america  na would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds under our credit facilities 
we have entered into interest rate protection agreements that have fixed the interest rate as of november  at for million of our variable rate debt under our credit facility 
the notional amount drops to million in october and to million in october
