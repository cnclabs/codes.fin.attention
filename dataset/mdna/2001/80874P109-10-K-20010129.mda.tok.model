we believe that we offer the broadest and most technologically advanced array of products and services in these industries and that we are the market leader in creating innovative pari mutuel wagering and lottery products 
our lottery group is the leading provider of instant lottery tickets and related services  accounting for approximately of all retail sales of instant lottery tickets in the united states in our lottery group also supplies technologically advanced on line lottery systems and instant ticket validation equipment to lotteries in the us and internationally 
our pari mutuel group is the leading provider of pari mutuel wagering systems worldwide and has an approximate share of the estimated billion of north american racing industry wagers  or handle 
our venue management group  utilizing our pari mutuel business expertise  owns or operates off track betting venues or otbs in connecticut  the netherlands and germany  from which we earn a significantly higher percentage of the handle than we earn by providing services to third party operators 
finally  our telecommunications products group leverages our superior lottery technology to create highly secure  paper based  prepaid phone cards for the rapidly growing international cellular telephone markets 
on september   autotote completed the acquisition of scientific games  a world leading supplier of lottery products  integrated lottery systems and support services  and prepaid telephone cards 
this acquisition combines autotote s pari mutuel wagering  venue management and on line lottery businesses with scientific games complementary instant lottery ticket and related services  on line lottery and instant ticket validation  and rapidly growing prepaid phone card businesses 
the acquisition was completed through a merger in which scientific games became a wholly owned subsidiary of autotote at a cost of approximately million in aggregate merger consideration to scientific games stockholders  plus related fees and expenses 
the acquisition has been recorded using the purchase method of accounting  and the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and the operating results of scientific games businesses have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of the acquisition 
the scientific games acquisition and the refinancing of substantially all existing debt of both autotote and scientific games  along with the payment of related fees and expenses  was completed with funds provided by proceeds from the issuance of million principal amount of our series a notes  million of term loan borrowings under our new senior credit facility  million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our new senior credit facility  million of cash on hand  and million of gross proceeds from the sale of new convertible preferred stock  principally to an affiliated entity of olivetti spa autotote historically operated primarily in three business segments pari mutuel operations  venue management operations and lottery operations 
autotote s lottery operations have historically included both domestic and international lottery service operations  including the sale of lottery systems and equipment 
autotote s pari mutuel operations have included all aspects of its pari mutuel service business  encompassing autotote s north american and international on track  off track and inter track pari mutuel services  simulcasting and communications services  video gaming  and sales of pari mutuel systems and equipment 
autotote s venue management operations have included its connecticut off track betting operations and its dutch on track and off track betting operations 
subsequent to the scientific games acquisition  we reorganized our operations into four business segments lottery group  pari mutuel group  venue management group and telecommunications products group 
our lottery group consists of two product lines instant tickets and related services itrs and lottery systems 
itrs includes ticket design and manufacturing as well as value added services  including game design  sales and marketing support  inventory management and warehousing and fulfillment services 
in addition  this division includes promotional instant tickets and pull tab tickets that we sell to both lottery and non lottery customers 
lottery systems is comprised of our historical lottery operations segment as well as scientific games systems business  both of which include the supply of transaction processing software for the accounting and validation of both instant ticket and on line lottery games  point of sale terminal hardware sales  central site computers and communication hardware sales  and ongoing support and maintenance services for these products 
this product line also includes software and hardware and support service for sports betting and credit card processing systems 
our pari mutuel group is comprised of the same businesses historically reported in autotote s pari mutuel operations segment which encompasses our north american and international on track  off track and inter track pari mutuel services  simulcasting and communications services  and video gaming  as well as sales of pari mutuel systems and equipment 
our venue management group is comprised of the same businesses historically reported in autotote s venue management operations segment and include the connecticut off track betting operations  and autotote s netherlands on track and off track betting operations 
our telecommunications products group is comprised of the prepaid cellular phone cards business 
in the second quarter of fiscal  autotote completed the sale of its sjc video business  which had previously been reported as a separate segment 
autotote s revenues are derived from two principal sources service revenues and sales revenues 
service revenues are earned pursuant to multi year contracts to provide itrs and wagering systems and services  or are derived from wagering by customers at facilities owned or leased by autotote 
sales revenues are derived from sales of prepaid phone cards  and from contracts for the sale of wagering systems  equipment  and software licenses 
the first quarter of autotote s fiscal year and a portion of its second fiscal quarter traditionally comprise the weakest season for pari mutuel wagering service revenue 
wagering equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software license revenue 
in addition  instant ticket and prepaid phone card sales may vary depending on the size and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  inventory ticket position  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions 
operating results may also vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition of scientific games in fiscal  the german pari mutuel service business in fiscal  and the netherlands pari mutuel venue management business in fiscal  which were all accounted for as purchases  all affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to autotote s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended october  lottery group in thousands service revenue    sales revenue    total operating revenue    gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization    pari mutuel group service revenue    sales revenue    total operating revenue    gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization    years ended october  venue management group service revenue    gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization    telecommunications products group sales revenue  gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization  sjc video group service revenue   gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization company total service revenue    sales revenue    total operating revenue    gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization    fiscal compared to fiscal revenue analysis lottery group service revenue of million in fiscal improved million from fiscal due to the addition of scientific games in september  plus a full year of service to the montana lottery which was launched in april  and the start up of the vermont and new hampshire lotteries in july sales revenue of million in fiscal decreased million from fiscal due to the april equipment sale to the montana lottery plus completion of the  terminal sale to sisal sport italia spa 
pari mutuel group service revenue of million in fiscal improved million or from fiscal million of this increase is attributable to the addition of the expanded german operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  plus revenue improvements in ireland and in the nasrin tm service operation 
these revenue increases were partially offset by lower revenues in the french racing operations and in the north american simulcasting operations 
sales revenue of million in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal primarily due to the fiscal sale of terminals to the uk tote  partially offset by fiscal sales to italy and chile 
venue management group service revenue of million in fiscal were slightly lower than in fiscal as handle related revenue increases of in the connecticut otb operations were completely offset by the effect of the lower euro exchange rate on the netherlands revenues 
telecommunications group sales revenue of million in fiscal are the result of the acquisition of scientific games in september sjc video group service revenue of 
million in fiscal are 
million less than fiscal as a result of the sale of the business in february gross profit analysis the total gross profit earned  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  of million in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal lottery group gross profit of million or of revenues improved million in fiscal from million or of revenues in fiscal the improvement is attributable to the addition of the scientific games business coupled with the addition of a full year of operation on the montana lottery contract and the addition of the vermont and new hampshire lottery contracts since july these increases were offset by lower equipment sales revenues in fiscal plus scientific games business integration costs 
in addition  the increases were impacted by the shutdown of the california plant and corresponding start up of the new press in the atlanta plant in the scientific games manufacturing operation 
the combination of the interrupted production and unusually high costs such as overtime and scrap  coupled with excess costs in the systems business of scientific games  is estimated to have had a million negative impact on ebitda in the fourth quarter of fiscal pari mutuel group gross profit of million in fiscal or of revenues improved million from million or of revenues in fiscal this improvement primarily reflects the benefits of additional revenue in the german operations and the continued growth of the nasrin operations  plus higher equipment sales  all partially offset by lower revenues in the french operations  reduced satellite transponder bulk market sales  and higher satellite service fees due to a credit received in fiscal from our satellite provider as a result of a service interruption 
during the year  the company largely completed the conversion of its satellite network to to compression but was unable to eliminate the resulting excess transponder capacity until late in the year due to market softness 
consequently an annualized saving of approximately million that was expected to contribute to profitability in fiscal will not begin until venue management group gross profit of million in fiscal or of revenues improved million from million or of revenues in fiscal this improvement primarily reflects higher handle and reduced operating costs in the connecticut otb operation  partially offset by approximately million of start up costs incurred in connection with the german otb joint venture 
telecommunications group gross profit of million in fiscal represents the group s results since their acquisition as part of scientific games in september sjc video group gross profit of nil in fiscal is 
million less than fiscal as a result of the sale of the business in january gross profit as a percent of service revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily as a result of the unusual production problems and excess systems costs in the lottery group in the fourth quarter of fiscal the gross profit as a percent of sales revenues was in fiscal  an increase from the gross profit percent of in fiscal as a result of changes in the mix of equipment and systems sold  and the addition of the telecommunications products group 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses  including software development costs  of million were million or higher than in fiscal this increase is attributable to the addition of the scientific games business  expanded german pari mutuel operations  growing domestic lottery operations in vermont and new hampshire  the million write off of the option to purchase atlantic city raceway  and scientific games business integration costs 
these increases were partially offset by cost reductions in nasrin tm and france  and the absence of the sjc video business 
depreciation and amortization expense of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of scientific games  coupled with the expanded domestic lottery business and the expanded german pari mutuel business 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of the sjc video business and the full depreciation of certain assets in prior periods 
interest expense of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal million of this increase is attributable to payments  in the form of warrants to purchase million shares of autotote common stock  to certain financial advisors in connection with their services in obtaining certain financial commitments  an additional million is due to the required pre funding of the new subordinated debt  and the balance is a result of higher debt levels incurred in connection with the acquisition of scientific games 
other income of 
million in fiscal consisted primarily of interest on invested excess cash  and other expense in fiscal consisted primarily of currency translation expense 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal the increase reflects the effects of the acquisition of scientific games 
income tax expense principally reflects federal alternative minimum tax  state taxes and foreign taxes  since no tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
extraordinary items in connection with the fiscal issuance of the notes and the subsequent repayment of all amounts outstanding under the existing bank credit facility see note and to the consolidated financial statements  autotote wrote off million of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the old notes and the and term loans and expensed million of call premium paid in connection with the redemption of the old notes 
there were no tax benefits recognized on the net extraordinary loss because autotote is currently in a tax loss carryforward position 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue analysis revenues increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal pari mutuel group services revenues of million in fiscal improved million or from the prior year 
this improvement primarily reflects revenues from the new nasrin tm operation and improved simulcasting revenues in germany 
these improvements were partially offset by the loss of a french pari mutuel service contract and fewer sales of excess transponder time in the domestic simulcasting operations 
pari mutuel equipment sales revenues of million in fiscal increased million or from the prior year  primarily due to sales of a system to the irish horseracing association  extrema tm terminals to the uk tote and max terminals to other international customers 
venue management group service revenues of million in fiscal improved million or from the prior year 
this improvement primarily reflects revenues from the netherlands operations that were acquired in july  higher connecticut otb revenues attributable to increased handle and the september opening of the racebook at the mohegan sun casino 
lottery group service revenues increased million in fiscal to million primarily due to the april launch of the montana lottery 
lottery equipment sales revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the fiscal sales of approximately  extrema tm terminals for use in the sisal sport italia spa lottery operations  and the march delivery of a central system  terminals and communications equipment to the montana lottery 
sjc video group service revenues decreased million in fiscal to million due to changes in customer preference from video production to film 
gross profit analysis the total gross profit earned  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  of million in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal gross profits earned by the pari mutuel group of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  principally due to higher profits in north american pari mutuel service operations  sales of extrema tm terminals to the uk tote operations  sales of max terminals to other international customers  and a full year of operation of the nasrin tm business 
these gross profit increases were partially offset by lower profit in the french pari mutuel operations due to the loss of a service contract in fiscal gross profits earned by the venue management group of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  principally due to the growth in handle in the connecticut otb operations 
gross profits earned by the lottery group of million for fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  primarily due to sales of extrema tm terminals for use in the sisal sport italia spa lottery operations and the march delivery of a central system  terminals and communications equipment to the montana lottery 
gross profit as a percent of service revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily reflecting lower margins on the netherlands operations that were acquired in july  partially offset by improved margins in the otb operations and a full year of nasrin tm operations 
the gross profit earned from systems and equipment sales was in fiscal  a decrease from the gross profit percent of in fiscal as a result of changes in the mix of equipment and systems sold 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses include marketing  sales  administrative  engineering and software development  finance  legal and other expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of the inclusion of the netherlands operations acquired in july and lower expenses reported in fiscal resulting from the collection of receivables previously reserved due to concerns about their recoverability 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation decreased by million primarily due to the lengthening of depreciable lives of pari mutuel terminals from seven to ten years effective november   as the result of the renewal of a number of service contracts and realized equipment durability 
additionally  in fiscal  we completed the installation of new lottery terminals for the connecticut state lottery under a contract with an initial five year term plus five one year options to extend the contract through may based on industry practice of lottery contracts and our historical relationship with the connecticut state lottery for the past ten years  we are depreciating the terminals and installation costs on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives of years 
amortization expenses decreased by million primarily as a result of the full amortization of certain intangible assets in fiscal interest expense of million in fiscal increased million from fiscal as a result of borrowings in connection with the fiscal installation of the connecticut lottery terminals 
other expense in fiscal consisted primarily of currency translation expenses  and other income of million in fiscal consisted primarily of interest on invested excess cash 
loss on disposition of business a charge of million was recorded to reflect the expected loss on disposition by sale of the sjc video production business as compared to a net loss on disposition of businesses of million in fiscal in fiscal  the sjc video production business incurred an operating loss of million 
income taxes income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal income tax expense principally reflects state taxes on connecticut otb operations and foreign taxes in fiscal  and foreign taxes in fiscal  since no tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
liquidity  capital resources and working capital deficiency in order to finance the scientific games acquisition and refinance certain existing indebtedness  we conducted a series of financings 
as a result  our capital structure changed significantly and  among other things  we are a significantly leveraged company 
as a result of the transactions  at october  we have total indebtedness outstanding of approximately million 
we have also recorded a substantial increase in goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the scientific games acquisition and a corresponding increase in amortization expense 
under our new senior secured credit facilities  a group of lenders has provided aggregate facilities totaling million  comprised of a six year term a loan of million  a seven year term b loan of million  and a six year revolver of million 
we borrowed the entire million of the term loan facilities in connection with the consummation of the scientific games acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of these loan facilities  including interest rates  amortization requirements and other terms 
in connection with the consummation of the scientific games acquisition  we issued million of new convertible preferred stock 
the dividends on the new convertible preferred stock accrue at the annual rate of per annum and are payable in kind until the ninth dividend payment  at which time we have the option  subject to the terms of the facility and notes  to pay dividends in cash  the new convertible preferred stock also has the right to participate in common stock dividends  if any  on an as converted basis 
the new convertible preferred stock is convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at the adjusted conversion price of per share  subject to a potential reset to not less than per share  and will automatically convert into common stock five years after issuance at the conversion price then in effect 
the initial conversion price of per share was adjusted to per share due to the issuance of million shares in redemption of the warrants issued to our financial advisors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the new convertible preferred stock 
at october   autotote s available cash and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at october  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended october  in fiscal  we spent million for wagering systems and capital expenditures  including million for the installation of a pari mutuel system for the monmouth and meadowlands racetrack  million in connection with the installation of the new hampshire and vermont on line lotteries and million to upgrade our satellite communications infrastructure 
in addition  we invested an additional million in software  primarily in connection with the above start up projects 
these investments were funded primarily with net cash provided by operating activities  million of proceeds from the sale of common stock  and long term debt 
a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and repay our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available to us for our operations  and capital expenditures 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated cost savings and operating improvements  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our new revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
we also may need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  including the notes  on or before their maturity  however  we cannot assure that we will able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our new senior credit facilities and the notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes in any event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as the company seeks debt and equity capital to sustain its operations 
at october   approximately one third of the company s debt was in fixed rate instruments 
we consider the fair value of all financial instruments to be not materially different from their carrying value at year end 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate october  expected maturity date dollars in there after total fair value long term debt fixed interest rate debt    interest rate variable interest rate         average interest rate in november  to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in market interest rates and in response to requirements in the facility see note to the consolidated financial statements the company entered into three interest rate swap contracts for an aggregate notional amount of  the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments 
the table presents notional amounts and weighted average swap rates by contractual maturity dates 
the company does not hold any market risk instruments for trading purposes 
notional amount by expected maturity average swap rate expected maturity date dollars in there after total fair value interest rate swaps fixed to variable    receive fixed month libor the company is also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  netherlands  france and austria 
the company s investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  the company does not hedge these net investments 
translation gains and losses historically have not been material 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii utilizing borrowings denominated in foreign currency  and iii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we believe that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would not have a significant adverse effect on the net earnings or cash flows of the company 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings 
this investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks
