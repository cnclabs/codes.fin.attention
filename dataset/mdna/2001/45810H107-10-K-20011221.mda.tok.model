certain reclassifications were made to the sat corporation financial statements to conform those financial statements to the company s presentations 
integral systems  inc is a maryland corporation incorporated in industry background the space industry can be broken down into the following industry sectors infrastructure  communications  emerging applications  and support services 
each of these sectors is funded by both government and commercial investments 
space infrastructure encompasses the development  manufacture and procurement of hardware and related systems for both space assets ie  satellites and payloads and ground assets ie  satellite ground systems 
the company s business is focused in the ground system component of the infrastructure sector 
the communications sector of the space industry includes revenue generated by satellite systems for commercial telecommunications services and government and military communications 
satellite technology has become critical to supporting many aspects of telecommunications infrastructure  including long distance telephone  personal communications systems  and private networks 
the emerging applications market includes space technologies utilized for new applications such as global positioning systems and remote sensing 
support services for the space industry include technical support  engineering  finance and consulting  which facilitate growth in space related markets 
according to a recent study by the international space business council  space industry revenues were billion in and will grow at a rate of approximately per year 
industry growth is supported by a study cited in space news predicting that nearly  satellites will be launched over the next years 
the space infrastructure revenues were approximately billion  comprising over half of the total space market 
the ground sector  which includes ground equipment  installations  and operations  accounted for approximately billion of total space infrastructure revenues 
the company estimates that the current worldwide command and control market represents approximately billion in annual revenues 
however  the company also believes that the increasing acceptance of cots products will lead to substantial price reductions and a subsequent decrease in market volume 
the company believes that its cots software products leave it well positioned to capitalize on this market trend  resulting in an increase in both its revenues and market share 
the space industry exhibits certain general characteristics 
first  the space industry is by nature global 
there is a trend towards privatization and deregulation in the communications and space industries which has engendered numerous opportunities for private concerns to become players in these traditionally government dominated markets 
opportunities in the space industry have also been generated by the rapid growth in the information technology industry 
second  there is an increasing demand for satellite based applications 
improvements in space and communications technologies have resulted in modern communications satellites with power  capacity  switching capabilities and longevity significantly greater than those of their predecessors 
these improvements in performance  together with satellites inherent geographic coverage and technical advantages  have made satellite based communications increasingly competitive with other communications technologies  broadening the market for satellite support services 
third  government and business organizations are increasingly demanding that satellite ground systems be designed for interoperability with computer hardware and software products and that such products be usable with existing legacy systems 
in addition  concerns over excessive development costs and the rapid pace of technological change have led both government and business organizations to demand flexible systems created by adapting cots software and hardware  rather than systems built to customized specifications 
this emphasis on system flexibility using readily available commercial products creates extensive opportunities for flexible cots products and for systems integration 
the company solution the company offers satellite ground systems that provide low cost  efficient and flexible operations 
the principal characteristics of the company s approach are as follows open systems and ease of integration 
the company s family of products addresses the dynamic environment of satellite operation through a commitment to open systems architecture 
the company s products are implemented as open systems with full adherence to industry hardware and software standards 
the company s software can be hosted on any unix or windows nt platform 
the open architecture of the company s products allows interoperability with existing systems 
although the company s software components are typically sold as bundled products  they may be purchased and operated separately or integrated with existing command and control software 
advanced architecture 
unlike the traditional host based approach  the company s ground systems are fully distributed  consisting of a set of workstations all communicating via a local area network lan backbone 
any software function can be performed on any workstation  eliminating the host computer bottleneck and allowing the processing and network loading to be fine tuned by reallocation of logical processes to physical hardware 
this approach also provides more reliable operations by eliminating single points of failure 
depth of functionality 
the company s command and control software supports all aspects of satellite operation through a bundle of four inter operable software products a real time package  an off line package  an orbit analysis package  and a database package 
the company s real time package performs daily and routine satellite operations  including commanding  telemetry processing and fault detection and correction 
the off line package supports sustaining engineering functions  including trending and statistical analysis of data archived by the real time system 
the orbit analysis package performs orbit determination and prediction functions to monitor and control the position of a satellite in space 
the database package tailors the performance of the other three packages  which are general in scope  to the specific requirements of each satellite mission 
that is  the database defines the telemetry and command characteristics and the desired orbital elements and tolerances 
flexibility adaptability 
a critical element to achieving initial operator acceptance of a new system and facilitating rapid implementation is the ability of the company s software to serve the needs of particular satellite systems 
all of the company s software is database driven  allowing it to support satellite design changes or different series of satellites  without modifying the underlying software 
similarly  the software also supports a wide range of cots hardware  including antenna  radio frequency rf and baseband equipment  allowing the total system to be delivered in the most efficient configuration for each mission 
finally  the software is platform independent and can run on any unix or windows nt computer 
this platform independence makes it possible for the company and its customers to take full advantage of rapidly declining computer costs 
superior price performance 
the company seeks to achieve superior price performance by providing comprehensive solutions within the budgetary needs of its customers 
the company believes that its cots software products provide advanced yet cost effective solutions for satellite operators 
these cots software products eliminate the need for expensive development services  thereby substantially reducing the overall cost of a ground system 
the company s database driven software allows satellites to be added over time  which permits the initial system acquisition costs to be amortized over years of operations 
the company believes its software products exceed industry expectations in functionality  technical sophistication and ease of use 
company strategy the company is currently a leading provider of satellite command and control systems  providing systems for a wide variety of satellites 
the company intends to extend its leadership and to expand its market share in world command and control solutions for users of all satellite types 
primary elements of the company s strategy include technological leadership 
the company intends to continue to commit substantial resources to further develop the next generation of its off the shelf software products 
in addition  because the satellite infrastructure industry is increasingly requiring standards compliance  the company intends to adhere to existing and future industry standards and participate in the further development of such standards 
strategic alliances and partnerships 
in addition to its own development and marketing organization  the company has and will continue to establish partnerships with select third parties  primarily satellite and hardware manufacturers  to assist the company in successfully integrating its software products  implementing total solution command and control systems and developing customer relationships 
integration with complementary products 
the company believes that its ability to offer command and control software products that can integrate seamlessly with all satellite types and ground system components is a key competitive advantage 
the company also intends to integrate its software products with complementary products  including visualization tools  scheduling engines and decision support aids in order to maintain its competitive advantage and provide maximum flexibility for its customers 
sales  support  service and marketing organizations 
the company currently sells and supports its command and control software through direct sales to satellite operators and systems integrators in north america  europe and asia 
the company plans to invest significantly in expanding its sales  support and service capabilities in these geographic regions while simultaneously gaining entry into other international emerging markets 
in the company formed a wholly owned european subsidiary  integral systems europe sas  with headquarters in toulouse  france 
this company provides sales  marketing  support  and engineering services to the european market 
the company also intends to augment its direct marketing efforts with us government organizations to capitalize on the growing acceptance of cots solutions in the government sphere 
as part of this strategy  the company opened an office in colorado springs  colorado to serve as the focal point for the company s support of its services  products and operations provided to the us air force 
in addition to expanding its market share in its core business  the company intends to draw on its capabilities and reputation in the command and control area to develop opportunities in related areas 
the key aspects of this growth strategy are as follows new suite of off the shelf applications 
the company intends to continue to broaden its cots line beyond command and control to include other applications currently utilizing customized solutions 
these applications  which include payload data processing  payload integration and test i t and ground equipment monitoring and control  have overlapping functionality with the company s command and control applications and provide significant market growth opportunities 
to date  the company has delivered more than a dozen systems for payload data processing and satellite i t 
professional services capabilities 
the company believes that providing comprehensive services and a high level of customer support is critical to its ability to maintain its leading position in command and control systems and to expand into new markets 
therefore  the company intends to expand its professional services organization in areas such as hardware testing  pre and post sale software support  quality assurance  project installation management and training 
the company is implementing an iso compliance program and is in the final stages of obtaining certification 

acquisitions of other companies 
the company intends to look for complementary businesses to acquire in order to strengthen and expand its core business 
products most of the company s sales involve a combination of cots software and hardware products together with development services for mission specific requirements and system integration as summarized below 
command and control software 
epoch  the company s cots software solution for satellite command and control  is designed to operate a variety of satellites with a minimum of personnel 
epoch s success has placed the company at the forefront of replacing antiquated satellite control centers with smaller systems that can fly multiple satellites produced by any manufacturer 
epoch s open architecture  in combination with a graphical user interface and automated monitoring and control features  allows operators to monitor and control both their satellites and ground systems 
epoch features a modern  distributed architecture consisting of a series of user workstations interconnected via an ethernet lan 
this approach provides better performance than traditional mini computer based ground systems at a lower cost 
epoch provides end to end satellite command and control capabilities  including telemetry processing and display  commanding and command verification cv  ground station automation  alarm event processing and data archive and retrieval 
these functions are driven by the epoch database  allowing the system to support multiple satellites solely through database updates  without modifying the run time software 
this results in lower maintenance and operations costs throughout the lifecycle 
the typical epoch installation consists of a front end processor which provides the interface to the front end hardware eg  bit syncs  command encoders and a series of user analysis workstations  all interconnected via the lan 
the front end processor executes a real time version of unix and services all the time critical requirements 
the analyst stations  operating under either unix or windows nt  provide the mechanism for users to control and monitor the satellite and the ground equipment 
with this approach  the processing burden is distributed across the network 
the system can be expanded indefinitely up to the capacity of the network by adding new workstation nodes 
even the network capacity limitations can be overcome by dividing the system into subnets inter connected by bridges and routers 
thus  additional users can be accommodated during peak loads with no degradation in system response times 
functionally  the software addresses all of the requirements for real time satellite control  including telemetry processing 
the epoch software provides end to end telemetry processing support  including frame decommutation  engineering unit eu conversion and limits checking 
commanding 
epoch provides full support for satellite commanding and cv 
the commanding software is mnemonic based  the user can transmit a command to the satellite by typing in the mnemonic from a pull down list arranged alphabetically or by spacecraft subsystem 
automation 
routine satellite and ground system control procedures can be fully automated via the epoch satellite test and operations language stol 
stol allows frequently used command and configuration sequences to be stored in ascii procedure files for automatic execution 
alarms events 
epoch provides a centralized alarm events processor for detecting and optionally correcting the following conditions command or telemetry verification failure  telemetry out of limits condition  front end processor failure or network communication problems 
data archive and retrieval 
a built in archive capability provides a permanent record of all significant ground system activity for long term trending and analysis 
oasys  the company s mission planning software  provides full spectrum support for spacecraft orbit determination and control  including measurement set reductions  orbit determination  ephemeris propagation  maneuver planning and orbit events reports 
oasys allows the user to manage a single spacecraft or a fleet in any earth orbit  including low earth  geosynchronous and molniya type orbits 
abe  the company s offline analysis package  provides trending and statistical analysis of the information recorded in the real time epoch archives 
abe supports automatic data extraction of key data  along with summary level statistics ie  daily and seasonal minimums and maximums  advanced statistical processing techniques ie  covariance  convolution and regression and graphical data visualization 
all of these applications are tailored to specific customer requirements through a fourth package  the database 
the database application is based on a commercial package for relational data base management system rdbms  with a top level user interface and functional extensions developed by the company 
the database provides fill in the blank menu edit forms allowing the operator to specify every relevant operational characteristic and threshold for the satellite  its orbit and the associated ground equipment

signal monitoring 
the company s subsidiary sat corporation manufactures software and systems for monitoring of space based and terrestrial communications 
customers in general  there are three major applications for satellites communications  remote sensing  and scientific research 
the company has customers in each of these areas 
the company believes that the combination of its proven cots software products and its strength as a systems integrator has positioned it to serve as an end to end provider of total solutions for all of these applications 
communications 
the company provides satellite command and control products for a variety of communications satellites 
one of the principal advantages that the company s products offer in the commercial sector is the ability to operate fleets of satellites from multiple vendors 
this capability allows operators to reduce costs by consolidating their control centers and using a single software package to operate their satellites 
the company s products are currently flying communications satellites from most of the major satellite manufacturers  including boeing  lockheed martin  space systems loral  orbital sciences  astrium  and alcatel 
the company s customers include newskies  echostar  ge americom  loral skynet  shin satellite  binariang satellite systems  orbital sciences  panamsat  cable wireless optus  and chinasat 
all of these operators have purchased the company s products to operate their fleets of geosynchronous earth orbit geo communications satellites

the company builds command and control systems as well as payload and image data processing systems for meteorological satellites 
since its inception  the company has provided ground systems for the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  including both their geostationary operational environmental satellite goes program and the television infrared observational satellite tiros programs 
the company s systems support mission operations  instrument data processing  simulation and flight software validation 
the company also built the complete command and control system for the us air force defense meteorological satellite program dmsp  whose operations were recently transitioned to civilian control under noaa s aegis 
since  the company has also been under contract to provide the dmsp program with satellite simulators used for training  ground system checkout and flight software analysis 
high performance ground systems are required to support earth resource satellites that provide military and civilian customers with accurate image data 
the company has provided such command and control subsystems to space imaging eosat and other operators 
scientific research 
the company has supported a variety of diverse and complex science missions 
the company has supported more than a dozen missions for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  including the small explorer smex missions  international solar terrestrial physics istp missions  x ray timing explorer xte and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 
projects range from the development of distributed command and control systems to validation of complex embedded flight software 
the company was selected by the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory to support the first nasa discovery mission  the near earth asteroid rendezvous program near 
near is the first in a series of low cost  small planet exploratory missions designed to gather data about asteroids in the solar system 
the company s epoch product forms the core of the mission s command and control ground system and also supports the spacecraft i t 
the applied physics laboratory is also using the company s products for their next series of scientific missions for nasa 
these include the contour  solar stereo  and messenger missions 
the national space program office nspo for the republic of china selected the company to provide the complete multi mission command and control system for their rocsat series of satellites 
the company also supports small satellite missions in the united states such as orbital sciences corporation s seastar and microlab programs 
marketing the company relies upon senior corporate management  project managers and senior technical staff to carry out its marketing program  including the development and execution of marketing plans  proposal presentations and the performance of related tasks 
these individuals collect information concerning requirements of current and potential customers in the course of contract performance and formal and informal briefings  from published literature and through participation in professional and industry organizations 
senior management evaluates this information  identifies potential business opportunities and coordinates proposal efforts 
the primary source of business in the company s existing markets is by referral from existing customers 
additionally  the company advertises periodically in space news magazine and other industry publications 
the company seeks business believed to be of long term benefit based on considerations such as technical sophistication  favorable market positioning and potential product spin offs 
one of the company s primary marketing strategies is to anticipate and understand the changing needs of its customers and then to be prepared to meet those needs as they arise in new programs or in new program functions 
this approach to marketing is mirrored in the company s products that are highly adaptable to growth and change in the requirements of each user 
contract revenue the company earns revenues from sales of its products and services through contracts that are funded by the us government as well as commercial and international organizations 
the company may be either a prime contractor directly to the end user of its products and services or it may act as a subcontractor under a contract with another company 
the percentages of revenues received by the company from prime contracts and subcontracts for fiscal years   and are as follows fiscal year contract source prime contract subcontract for a given contract  the revenue mix may include the company s cots software products  pass through of third party hardware and software  and services provided by the company or its subcontractors 
the company generates revenue under three types of contracts cost plus  fixed price  and time and material t m contracts 
under a cost plus contract  the company is reimbursed for allowable costs within the contractual terms and conditions and is paid a negotiated fee 
the fee may be fixed or based on performance incentives 
revenue recognition under a cost plus contract is based upon actual costs incurred and a pro rata amount of the negotiated fee 
under a fixed price contract  the company is paid a stipulated price for services or products and bears the risk of increased or unexpected costs 
revenue under a fixed price contract is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
under a t m contract  the company receives fixed hourly rates intended to cover salary costs attributable to work performed on the contract and related overhead expenses  reimbursement for other direct costs and a profit 
revenue is recognized under a t m contract at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
a considerable amount of the company s revenue is earned under cost plus contracts 
to date  the vast majority of contracts for the purchase of the company s cots software products have been fixed priced in nature  either firm fixed price contracts or t m fixed labor rate contracts 
the following table summarizes the percentage of revenues attributable to each contract type for the period indicated fiscal year contract type cost plus fixed price time and materials us government contracts company revenues from us government contracts are derived from a combination of contracts with the us government and subcontracts with other companies that have prime contracts with the us government 
for fiscal years   and approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government 
noaa  one agency  represented   and of revenues  respectively  for fiscal years   and the company expects that at least of its revenue for fiscal year will be derived from noaa contracts 
the loss of any one of these noaa contracts could significantly affect the company s performance 
similarly  the expiration  or termination for convenience  of any major contract could significantly affect the company s performance if not renewed or replaced by contracts of similar value 
it is estimated that the single largest noaa contract will represent approximately of the company s fiscal year revenue 
this contract is to develop the ground system used to operate the next generation of geosynchronous weather satellites at noaa 
us government contracts are awarded by formal advertising or procurement by negotiation 
negotiated procurements may  but do not necessarily  involve the solicitation of competitive proposals 
if competitive proposals are solicited  the us government selects the proposal most advantageous to it and then conducts negotiations with the selected bidder 
many of the us government programs in which the company participates as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years but are funded only on an annual basis 
accordingly  the company s contracts and subcontracts are subject to termination  reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government s requirements or budgetary constraints 
additionally  when the company participates in a project as a subcontractor  it is subject to the risk that the prime contractor may fail or be unable to perform the prime contract 
all of the company s us government contracts and subcontracts are also subject to termination for convenience  which means termination without cause 
should a contract be so terminated  the company would be reimbursed for allowable costs to the date of termination and would be paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profits or fees attributable to the work actually performed 
the company s books and records are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
such audits can result in adjustments to contract costs and fees 
although the company thus far has not been required to make any material audit adjustments  the possibility that such adjustments will be required always exists 
management is of the opinion that any such audit adjustments would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
the company has been audited by dcaa through fiscal year the company s contracts and subcontracts with federal government agencies are subject to competition and awarded on the basis of technical merit  personnel qualifications  experience and price 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in procurement policies  a reduction in funds available for the services provided by it and other risks generally associated with federal government contracts 
new government contract awards also are subject to protest by competitors at the time of award that can result in the re opening of the competition or evaluation process  or the award of a contract to a competitor 
the company considers such bid protests to be a customary element in the process of procuring government contracts 
in addition to the right to terminate  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and are typically subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding 
congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take several years 
consequently  at the outset of a major program  the contract is usually incrementally funded  and additional funds are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency as appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
in addition  contractors often experience revenue uncertainties during the first quarter of the government s fiscal year  which begins october  until differences between budget requests and appropriations are resolved 
to date  congress has funded all years of the multi year major program contracts for which the company has served as prime contractor or a subcontractor  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future 
non us government contracts in addition to having contracts with the us government  the company also has contracts with commercial and international organizations 
for fiscal years   and approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from non us government contracts 
these contracts are typically with commercial satellite operators  satellite manufacturers  aerospace systems integrators and foreign governments 
some of the company s non us government contracts are with international organizations 
for fiscal years   and approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from international organizations 
revenues from foreign sources are discussed in footnote number of the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere herein 
operations in numerous countries outside the united states carry substantial managerial  operational  legal  and political uncertainties 
these operations are subject to changes in government regulations and telecommunications standards  tariffs or taxes  and other trade barriers 
in addition  the company s agreements relating to foreign operations may be enforceable only in foreign jurisdictions so that it may be difficult for the company to enforce its rights 
the company currently has one contract that is subject to currency fluctuations in foreign markets  which is not material 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not enter into these types of contracts in the future 
in addition  various agencies and departments of the us government regulate the company s ability to pursue business opportunities outside the united states 
exports of space related products  services  and technical information require licenses granted by the us government 
the company does not currently have blanket authorization for export of its products or services and cannot assure that it will be able to obtain necessary licenses or approvals on a per transaction basis 
most of the company s non us government contracts are awarded competitively and are performed on a fixed price basis 
typically  these contracts are for turnkey systems that are delivered by the company in six to eighteen months 
payment is most often based on delivery milestones established in the company s contract 
in addition  the contracts may include a system warranty period that lasts one to two years 
the company also offers extended support for the system on a fixed price or t m basis 
for certain of the company s non us government contracts  the company often has terms in its contracts under which the customer can enforce performance of the company or seek damages in case the company does not perform as agreed to in the contract 
contracts may require the company to post a performance bond  establish an irrevocable letter of credit  or agree to pay liquidated damages in the event of late delivery 
in addition  although a significant portion of the company s revenues are generated from the sale of its services and products in commercial markets  the company cannot assure that it will continue to compete successfully in these markets 
many of the company s commercial contracts are for a fixed price 
this subjects the company to substantial risks relating to unexpected cost increases and other factors outside of its control 
in addition  the company may fail to anticipate technical problems  estimate costs accurately  or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract 
sale of software products most of the company s contracts include the sale of proprietary software products 
sales of the company s software products take many forms 
the company sells i software only a software only sale  ii software and services together  or iii software  services and hardware together 
in addition  depending on a customer s requirements  the company may or may not provide post contract customer support pcs 
the company s recognition of revenue for sales of company software products depends on customer requirements and the nature of the contracts involved 
for a software only sale  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment 
in situations where software is sold together with services and or hardware  the company recognizes software license revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
with respect to pcs  the company recognizes pcs revenue on a percentage of completion basis when pcs is part of a broader fixed price contract that includes software and services 
alternatively  when pcs services ie software maintenance and support are awarded to the company under a separate maintenance contract  the company recognizes pcs revenue on a straight line basis pro rata over the term of the maintenance contract 
backlog the company s estimated backlog is as follows sept 
 sept 
 sept 
 outstanding commitments    general commitments    total    represents orders that are firm and funded 
represents orders that are firm but not yet funded and contracts awarded but not yet signed 
under outstanding commitments  the company agrees to provide specific services  frequently over an extended period of time  with continued performance of those services contingent upon the customer s year to year decision to fund the contract 
general commitments consist of contract options and sole source business that management believes likely to be exercised or awarded in connection with existing contracts 
contract options are the company s contractual agreement to perform specifically defined services only in the event the customer thereafter requests the company to do so 
sole source business refers to contract work which the company reasonably expects to be awarded based on its unique expertise in a specific area or because it has previously done all such work in that area for the customer or prime contractor who will award the contract 
the company estimates that of backlog as of september  will be completed during fiscal year estimated backlog includes contract options through july   including general commitments 
many of the company s contracts are multi year contracts and contracts with option years  and portions of these contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of the company s contract backlog 
the company s total contract backlog represents management s estimate of the aggregate unearned revenues expected to be earned by the company over the life of all of its contracts  including option periods 
because many factors affect the scheduling of projects  there can be no assurance as to when revenues will be realized on projects included in the company s backlog 
in addition  although contract backlog represents only business which is considered to be firm  there can be no assurance that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur 
the majority of backlog represents contracts under the terms of which cancellation by the customer would entitle the company to all or a portion of its costs incurred and potential fees to the date of cancellation 
however  the company also believes that backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
the company s backlog typically is subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded 
additionally  all us government contracts included in backlog may be terminated at the convenience of the government 
competition the company experiences significant competition in all of the areas in which it does business 
the company believes it is one of four companies in the united states that derive the major portion of their revenue from the development of satellite ground systems 
the company competes with numerous companies having similar capabilities  some of which are larger and have considerably greater financial resources  including lockheed martin corporation  boeing satellite systems  loral space communications ltd  raytheon company  orbital sciences corporation  honeywell international inc formerly alliedsignal  computer sciences corporation  alcatel espace  and astrium 
many of these competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
in addition  some of these competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of large  diversified companies that have access to the financial resources of their parent companies 
some of our competitors are also current or potential customers 
in addition  several smaller companies have specialized capabilities in similar areas 
in general  the markets in which the company competes are not dominated by a single company  instead  a large number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
because its command and control business is specialized and the company is a leader in cots software products  the market for this business is somewhat less competitive 
in the command and control software market  the company competes against other companies in the space industry 
the company s products also face competition from certain government off the shelf  or gots  products for satellite command and control 
in its other business areas  ground equipment and systems integration  the company competes against systems integrators and product manufacturers 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the businesses in which it operates are technical understanding  management capability  past contract performance  personnel qualifications  and price

included in cost of revenue are direct labor expenses  overhead charges associated with the company s direct labor base and other costs that can be directly related to specific contract cost objectives  such as travel  consultants  equipment  subcontracts  and other direct costs 
gross margins on contract revenues vary depending on the type of product or service provided

by contrast  gross margins rates for equipment and subcontract pass throughs seldom exceed 
engineering service gross margins typically range between and 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year on a consolidated basis  revenue was essentially flat at million for both periods 
although revenue at sat corporation decreased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  this decrease was offset by gains in the remainder of the company s commercial products and services revenues and the company s government services revenues

the gross margin decline for pass through revenue resulted from the shipment of million less pass through revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the service revenue margin would have been higher were it not for a one time unanticipated contract overrun that negatively impacted margins by almost  recorded during the fourth quarter of the current year

there is no assurance that the company s projections will in fact be achieved and these projections do not reflect any acquisitions or divestitures  which may occur in the future

the company currently anticipates that its current cash balances  amounts available under its lines of credit and net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company believes that inflation did not have a material impact on the company s revenues or income from operations in fiscal years   and forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in the business section  in other parts of this k  and in this section  including those under the headings outlook and liquidity and capital resources  are forward looking 
in addition  from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue  or other similar words  including statements as to the intent  belief  or current expectations of the company and its directors  officers  and management with respect to the company s future operations  performance  or positions or which contain other forward looking information 
these forward looking statements are predictions 
no assurances can be given that the future results indicated  whether expressed or implied  will be achieved 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
while the company believes that these statements are and will be accurate  a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s statements 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and upon various conditions specific to its industry  and future trends cannot be predicted with certainty 
particular risks and uncertainties that may effect the company s business  other than those described elsewhere herein  include the following 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government  which are subject to termination without cause  government regulations and audits  competitive bidding  and the budget and funding process of the us government 

the presence of competitors with greater financial resources and their strategic response to the company s new services 

the potential obsolescence of the company s services due to the introduction of new technologies 

the response of customers to the company s marketing strategies and services 

the company s commercial contracts are subject to strict performance and other requirements 

the intense competition in the satellite ground system industry could harm our financial performance 

risks related to the company s acquisition strategy 
in particular  the company may not be able to find any attractive candidates or it may find that the acquisition terms proposed by potential acquisition candidates are not favorable to the company 
in addition  thecompany may compete with other companies for these acquisition candidates  which competition may make an acquisition more expensive for the company 
if the company is unable to identify and acquire any suitable candidates  the company may not be able to find alternative uses for the cash proceeds of its previous private placements that improve the company s business  financial conditions  or results of operations to the extent that an acquisition could 
in addition  if the company is able to identify and acquire one or more businesses as it did with sat corporation  the integration of the acquired business or businesses may be costly and may result in a decrease in the value of the company s common stock for the following reasons  among others 
the company may not adequately assess the risks inherent in a particular acquisition candidate or correctly assess the candidate s potential contribution to the company s financial performance  
the company may need to divert more management resources to integration than it planned  which may adversely affect its ability to pursue other more profitable activities  
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures  
the company may not eliminate as many redundant costs as it anticipated in selecting acquisition candidates  and an acquisition candidate may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that the company failed to discover through its due diligence prior to the acquisition 

changes in activity levels in the company s core markets 
while sometimes presented with numerical specificity  these forward looking statements are based upon a variety of assumptions relating to the business of the company  which although considered reasonable by the company  may not be realized 
because of the number and range of the assumptions underlying the company s forward looking statements  many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the reasonable control of the company  some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this document 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectation  and the company assumes no obligation to update 
therefore  the actual experience of the company and the results achieved during the period covered by any particular forward looking statement should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that these estimates will be realized  and actual results may vary materially 
there can be no assurance that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward looking statements contained herein will prove to be accurate
