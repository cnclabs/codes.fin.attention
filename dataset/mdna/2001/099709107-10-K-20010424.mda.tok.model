average cash requirements to open a new or expanded waldenbooks store range from million to million  depending on the size and format of the store 
the company plans to lease new store locations predominantly under operating leases 
the company plans to execute its expansion plans for its borders superstores and other strategic initiatives principally with funds generated from operations and financing through the lease and credit facilities 
the company believes funds generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facility and financing through the lease facility will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital requirements for at least the next two to three years 
as discussed below  the credit and lease facilities expire in october  but the company expects to be able to successfully renew the facilities 
the company believes that its borrowing costs may increase beginning in november  if financial market conditions are unchanged 
the company currently has a share repurchase program in place with remaining authorization to repurchase approximately million 
during and  million and million of common stock was repurchased  respectively 
the company has a million multicurrency credit agreement the credit facility which expires in october borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate or an increment over libor at the company s option 
the credit facility contains covenants which limit  among other things  the company s ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make acquisitions  merge  declare dividends  dispose of assets  issue or repurchase its common stock in excess of million plus any proceeds and tax benefits resulting from stock option exercises and tax benefits resulting from restricted shares purchased by employees from the company  and require the company to meet certain financial measures regarding fixed charge coverage  leverage and tangible net worth 
the company is prohibited under the credit facility from paying cash dividends on common shares 
the company has a million lease financing facility the lease facility to finance new stores and other property through operating leases which expires in october the lease facility provides financing to lessors through loans from a third party lender for up to of a project cost 
it is expected that lessors will make equity contributions approximating of each project 
independent of its obligations as lessee  the company guarantees payment when due of all amounts required to be paid to the third party lender 
the principal amount guaranteed will be limited to approximately of the original cost of a project  so long as the company is not in default under the lease relating to such project 
the lease facility contains covenants and events of default that are similar to those contained in the credit facility described above 
there were properties financed through the lease facility  with a financed value of million  at january  management believes that the rental payments for properties financed through the lease facility may be lower than those which the company could obtain elsewhere due to  among other factors  i the lower borrowing rates available to the company s landlords under the facility  and ii the fact that rental payments for properties financed through the facility do not include amortization of the principal amounts of the landlords indebtedness related to the properties 
rental payments relating to such properties will be adjusted when permanent financing is obtained to reflect the interest rates available at the time of the refinancing and the amortization of principal 
in october  the company transferred four properties previously financed under the lease facility  with a total financed value of million  to a new temporary facility with terms similar to those of the lease facility 
in february  two of these properties were transferred back to the lease facility  and two were permanently financed through operating leases 
also in february  ten additional properties previously financed through the lease facility with a total financed value of million were permanently financed through operating leases 
during  the company entered into agreements in which leases with respect to four borders locations serve as collateral for certain mortgage pass through certificates 
these mortgage pass through certificates include a provision requiring the company to repurchase the underlying mortgage notes in certain events  including the failure by the company to make payments of rent under the related leases  the failure by kmart corporation the former parent of the company to maintain required investment grade ratings or the termination of the guarantee by kmart of the company s obligations under the related leases which would require mutual consent of kmart and borders 
in the event the company is required to repurchase all of the underlying mortgage notes  the company would be obligated to pay approximately million 
the company would expect to fund this obligation through its line of credit 
the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  as interest on the company s borrowings is principally based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company primarily utilizes interest rate swaps and collars to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate exposures to fixed interest rates 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt  and its payments under the lease facility  are principally based 
if libor were to increase for the full year in as compared to the end of  the company s after tax earnings  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements  would decrease million based on the company s expected average outstanding debt  including its indirect borrowings under the lease facility  as of january  a portion of the company s operations takes place in foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom  australia  new zealand and singapore 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company operates 
the company has generally not used derivative instruments to manage this risk 
seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal  with sales significantly higher and substantially all operating income realized during the fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season
