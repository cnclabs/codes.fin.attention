consolidated net income for was million compared to million in and million in diluted earnings per share increased from in and in to in for the year ended  shares outstanding on a diluted basis were million  up from million for the year ended and million for the year ended the increase in diluted average shares outstanding from to is attributable primarily to the increase in the number of in the money stock options included in the diluted average shares outstanding calculation 
this occurred due to an appreciation in the price of the company s common stock  which began in the second half of and continued into the increase relating to stock options was offset in part by stock repurchases under the company s share repurchase program described below 
revenues consolidated revenues in totaled million  representing an increase of over revenues of million  which were over revenues of million 
inovoject r system revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in  representing increases of from to  and from to  with the increase coming principally from additional installations of inovoject r systems and increased injection activity in europe  asia and latin america as well as inovoject r system sales in north america and europe 
the revenues include inovoject r system lease fees derived from multi year contracts and paid trials in the united states and foreign countries  and the sale of inovoject r systems to distributors 
the sale of inovoject r systems to distributors may cause variability in revenue and gross profit on an annual and quarterly basis 
embrex estimates that as of december   it was vaccinating in excess of of the estimated billion broiler birds grown in the united states in   and given its market penetration  the company expects only moderate inovoject r systems revenue growth in this market 
management anticipates moderate revenue and earnings growth in from existing inovoject r system operations in the united states and canada  higher revenue and earnings growth from new inovoject r system leases in other countries  and sales of bursaplex r product to poultry producers worldwide 
however  the rate at which the marketplace will accept the inovoject r system technology outside the united states and canada  the timing of regulatory approvals of third party vaccines for in ovo use outside the united states and canada  start up costs in new markets  possible variability in united states hatchery bird production as a result of grain price fluctuations  and variability in the demand for  and pricing of  us poultry and poultry products both inside and outside the united states  will impact the pace of revenue growth  if any  and the sustaining of profitability from the installation and operational throughputs of inovoject r systems 
sales of bursaplex r  the company s proprietary vaccine for the treatment of avian infectious bursal disease  and vnf r to ft 
dodge  generated million of product revenues in while bursaplex sales were the principal source of million of product revenues in and  of product revenues in this represents product revenue increases of for over and for over bursaplex r sales alone increased as continued demand in the asian and latin american markets out paced and the north american region began selling bursaplex r to its japanese distributor during the third quarter 
the company s ability to generate revenue from product sales has been constrained by lower levels of breeder and broiler flock vaccination rates  fewer reported incidences of bursal disease in the united states and the previously announced delay associated with ft 
dodge s obtaining british regulatory approval for the sale of bursamune r in the united kingdom 
however  in april  ft 
dodge received marketing authorization from the veterinary products committee in the united kingdom for the in ovo administration of bursamune r to broiler chickens 
cost of product sales and inovoject r revenues cost of revenues equaled of total revenues in as compared to and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily attributable to the  audit adjustment due to misappropriation at the company s embrex europe subsidiary as described below under recent development 
these adjustments included changes to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  which flowed through to cost of revenue 
in addition  various international start up operating expenses were reclassified as cost of revenue  beginning in january operating income was not affected by the operating expense classification change 
operating expenses operating expenses totaled million in compared to million in  and million in general and administrative g a expenses were million in  down from million in  and up from million in the decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned reclassification of international start up expenses from g a to sales and marketing and cost of revenue while the g a increases over were primarily attributable to development costs in asia and latin america as well as legal expenses incurred in connection with various patent infringement lawsuits filed by the company 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million in compared to  in and  in increases during these periods resulted from growth in the company s sales and customer service functions to support market expansion and field support of inovoject r systems  as well as stepped up international activity  principally in europe  asia and latin america 
the reclassification of international start up expenses from g a to sales and marketing also contributed to the increase 
research and development r d expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in r d expense from to largely reflects an increase in outside contract research  supplies consumption  operating expenses for the new research facility and inovoject r system design and development and global technical support activity 
the company continues to manage its research and development effort to leverage its know how  patent position  market presence and expenditures 
other income and expense interest income totaled   and  in years   and  respectively 
the decreasing interest income from to resulted principally from lower cash balances  which were primarily attributable to the common stock repurchase program described below 
interest expense totaled  in compared to  in and  in in  the decrease in interest expense reflected the repayment of approximately  of capital equipment leases 
in  the decrease in interest expense reflected the repayment of approximately million of external financing  primarily in the form of equipment leases 
management expects to continue to rely on the use of internally generated funds to finance the cost of additional inovoject r systems in  as was the case in effect of inflation management expects cost of product sales and inovoject r systems revenues  operating expenses and capital equipment costs to change in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
while management generally believes that the company will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting selling lease prices and effecting operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse affect on its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and short term investment balances totaled million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease reflected the ability of the company to fund capital expenditures with internal cash instead of equipment lease financing 
working capital decreased to million in from million in during  operating activities generated million in cash  primarily due to non cash depreciation and net income 
within investing activities  inovoject r systems and equipment purchases required million 
financing activities used million  of which million was used for common stock repurchases see below and million was used to repay capital lease and line of credit obligations 
these expenditures were partially offset by million received for issuance of common stock  substantially all of which was issued in connection with the exercise of stock options during in october  the company announced that the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the repurchase program to purchase up to of outstanding shares of common stock  or up to approximately  shares over months  in open market or privately negotiated transactions

this extension allows for the purchase up to of outstanding shares  or up to approximately  shares over months in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for million at an average price of per share under the repurchase program  which ended during the third quarter of during the entire term of the repurchase program  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for million at an average price of per share

this line of credit may be used for working capital purposes and was extended in october for an additional months and will now expire in april at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
based on its current operations  management believes that the company s available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flow from operations and its bank line of credit  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements as these currently exist  but may continue to explore alternative funding opportunities with respect to collaborative ventures and new product development 
recent development on march   the company announced that during the year end audit  employee misappropriation and related irregularities were discovered at its european subsidiary  embrex europe  ltd

while revenues were not affected  net income for the year was adversely impacted by approximately million  or per share
