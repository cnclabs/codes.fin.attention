item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the year  webster reported net income of million  or per diluted common share which exceeded net income of million for the previous year period by million or 
the improvement for the current year period was the result of increased net interest income combined with higher noninterest income that more than offset an increase in operating expenses 
the increase in net interest income primarily reflects an increase of million in average interest earning assets and higher realized yields for the current year period 
interest rate spread was and interest margin was for the current year period 
noninterest income reached million and increased million or when compared to million for the previous year period 
the increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increased income from fees  service charges  commissions and financial advisory services that were million over the previous year period 
noninterest expenses compared to the previous year  excluding million of acquisition related costs  increased million 
the increase in noninterest expenses  for the current year period is primarily the result of purchase acquisitions that were completed during the year period that increased compensation and benefits expense  occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses and intangible amortization expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the purchase acquisitions 
comparison of and years net interest income net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million in to million from million in the increase is due primarily to a higher level of average interest earning assets and increased yields on the assets that more than offset the effect of higher interest bearing liabilities and higher costs on the liabilities 
see interest income and interest expense discussions that follow 
interest rate spread for was as compared to for the decrease in interest rate spread was primarily due to higher costs incurred on time deposits and borrowed funds

this requirement  which may be varied by the ots  is based upon a percentage of net withdrawable deposits and short term borrowings 
the required liquidity ratio is currently and the bank s liquidity ratio at december  exceeded the requirement 
webster bank is also required by regulation to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations 
adequate liquidity as assessed by the ots may vary from institution to institution depending on such factors as the institution s overall asset liability structure  market conditions  competition and the nature of the institution s deposit and loan customers 
the ots considers both an institution s liquidity ratio as well as safety and soundness issues in assessing whether an institution has sufficient liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management allows webster to meet cash needs at a reasonable cost under various operating environments 
liquidity is actively managed and reviewed in order to maintain stable cost effective funding to support the balance sheet 
liquidity comes from a variety of sources such as the cash flow from operating activities including principal and interest payments on loans and investments  unpledged securities which can be sold or utilized to secure funding and by maintaining the ability to attract new deposits 
webster s goal is to maintain a strong base of core deposits to support its growing balance sheet 
management monitors current and projected cash needs and adjusts liquidity as necessary 
webster has a detailed liquidity contingency plan  which is designed to respond to liquidity concerns in a prompt and comprehensive manner 
it is designed to provide early detection of potential problems and details specific actions required to address liquidity risks

asset liability management and market risk interest rate risk is the sensitivity of the market value of webster s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and the sensitivity of webster s earnings to changes in interest rates over short term and long term time horizons 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control risk within limits approved by the board of directors 
webster s asset liability management committee manages interest rate risk to maximize net interest income and net market value over time in changing interest rate environments 
management measures interest rate risk using simulation analyses with particular emphasis on measuring changes in net market value and net interest income in different rate environments 
market value is measured as the net present value of future cash flows 
simulation analysis incorporates assumptions about balance sheet changes such as asset and liability growth  loan and deposit pricing and changes due to the mix of assets and liabilities 
key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  fluctuations in product balances  prepayment speeds and decay rates on deposits 
from such simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented 
to a limited degree  webster also uses various interest rate contracts including futures and options  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors 
webster utilizes these financial instruments to manage interest rate risk by reducing net exposures 
these interest rate financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
market risk is the effect of a change in interest rates on the value of the instruments 
the notional amount of interest rate financial instruments is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based 
the notional amount is not exchanged and therefore  the notional amounts should not be taken as a measure of credit risk 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
webster holds futures and options positions and interest rate contracts to minimize the price volatility of certain assets held as trading securities 
changes in the market value of these positions are recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period for which the change occurred

change in compared to an unfavorable million or change in based on webster s asset liability mix at december   management estimates that an instantaneous basis point increase in interest rates would decrease net interest income over the next twelve months by compared to a decrease at december  an instantaneous basis point decline in interest rates would increase net interest income by compared to at december  these estimates assume that management takes no action to mitigate any negative effects from changing interest rates 
the market values and net interest income estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ 
management believes that webster s interest rate risk position at december   represents a reasonable level of risk 
asset quality nonaccrual assets  loan delinquency and credit losses are considered by webster to be key measures of asset quality 
asset quality  accordingly  affects webster s determination of the allowance for loan losses

probable losses are estimated based upon a quarterly review of the loan portfolio  loss experience  specific problem loans  economic conditions and other pertinent factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
in assessing the specific risks inherent in the portfolio  management takes into consideration the risk of loss on webster s nonaccrual loans  classified loans and watch list loans including an analysis of the collateral for the loans 
provisions  charged to the business lines  increase the allowance for loan losses 
webster s allowance for loan losses at december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover expected losses in the portfolio 
webster s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements 
the loan portfolio is segmented into pools of loans that are similar in type and risk characteristic 
these homogeneous pools are tracked over time and historic delinquency  nonaccrual and loss information is collected and analyzed 
in addition  problem loans are identified and analyzed individually on a periodic basis to detect specific probable losses 
webster collects industry delinquency  nonaccrual and loss data using the same portfolio segments for comparison purposes 
webster analyzes the data and estimates its probable losses in the portfolio by calculating formula and specific allowances for nonaccruing loans 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to the loan pools and certain unused commitments  based on the historic default and loss rates  internal risk ratings  and other risk based characteristics 
changes in risk ratings  and other risk factors  from period to period for both performing and nonperforming loans affect the calculation of the formula allowance 
loss factors are based on webster s loss experience  and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
webster considers the following when determining probable losses o webster utilizes migration models  which track the dynamic business characteristics inherent in the specific portfolios 
the assumptions are updated periodically to match changes in the business cycle 
o pooled loan loss factors not individually graded loans are based on expected net charge offs 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature  such as residential and consumer loans 
o the loan portfolios are characterized by historical statistics such as default rates  cure rates  loss in event of default rates and internal risk ratings 
o webster statistically evaluates the impact of larger concentrations in the commercial loan portfolio 
o comparable industry charge off statistics by line of business  broadly defined as residential  consumer  home equity second mortgages  commercial real estate and commercial industrial lending  are utilized as factors in calculating loss estimates in the webster loan portfolios 
o webster reviews actual losses by portfolio segment to validate estimated future probable losses 
at december   webster s allowance for loan losses was million  or of the total loan portfolio  and of total nonaccrual loans 
this compares with an allowance for loan losses of million or of the total loan portfolio  and of total nonaccrual loans at december  the increase in webster s allowance for loan losses for commercial loans was due to a reallocation of the loan loss allowance from the residential mortgage loans 
the residential allowance for loan losses were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease of million in the allowance for loan losses for residential mortgages reflects a lower estimated requirement based upon the actual losses experienced over the preceding two years 
management considered the actual loss experience as part of its decision to reallocate a portion of the residential mortgage loan loss allowance to the commercial loan loss allowance 
in addition  the mix of the overall loan portfolio changed  which resulted in an increase in commercial loans 
this was due to internal growth and the acquisitions of new england community bank and mechanics savings bank 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years follows for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period      charge offs residential      commercial      consumer      recoveries residential    commercial      consumer net charge offs      allowances from purchase transactions     reclassification of allowance for segregated asset losses  provisions charged to operations      balance at end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding loan losses net charge offs for totaled million as compared to million for reflecting a decrease in net charge offs of  for the current period 
the decrease was primarily the result of residential and consumer net charge offs being million lower for that was partially offset by commercial loan net charge offs being  higher for the current year period 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses of million from december  to is the result of a provision of million  an allowance of million acquired in a purchase acquisition completed during and net charge offs of million 
the million increase was primarily related to the mechanics purchase acquisition completed in june see item business combinations under part i of this report for information concerning acquisitions completed during included in the charge offs were write downs of million related to the bulk sales of million of primarily nonaccrual and delinquent loans 
included in the charge offs were write downs of million related to a bulk sale of million of nonaccrual residential loans and foreclosed properties

an asset is considered substandard if inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses that are present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that to continue to report them as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
in addition  assets that do not currently warrant classification in one of the foregoing categories but which are deserving of management s close attention are designated as special mention assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots which can order the establishment of additional valuation allowances 
at december   the bank s classified loans totaled million  consisting of million in loans classified as substandard  of which million are commercial loans that are accruing interest  million in loans classified as doubtful and none classified as loss 
at december   the bank s classified loans totaled million  consisting of million in loans classified as substandard  million in loans classified as doubtful and none classified as loss 
at december   the bank had million of potential problem loans or commitments in its commercial loan portfolio for which management has doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present repayment terms or commitment conditions 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a banking institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on webster s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

tax legislation federal tax law changes were enacted in august to eliminate the thrift bad debt method of calculating bad debt deductions for tax years after and to impose a requirement to recapture into taxable income over a six year period all bad debt reserves accumulated after since webster previously recorded a deferred tax liability with respect to these post reserves  its total income tax expense for financial reporting purposes will not be affected by the recapture requirement 
the tax law changes also provide that taxes associated with the recapture of pre bad debt reserves would become payable under more limited circumstances than under prior law 
under the tax laws  as amended  events that would result in recapture of the pre bad debt reserves include stock and cash distributions to the holding company from the bank in excess of specified amounts
