results of operations compared to revenues total revenue in was million  an increase of compared to apartment rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income in was million  an increase of compared to this increase reflects improvements in both occupancy and average rental rates in average economic occupancy for all apartments was in compared to in average monthly revenue per occupied unit for all apartments was in compared to in these comparisons reflect the results for all  apartments in operation through the entire months of both and our acquisition of oak hollow apartments phase took place in late december apartment rental income was consistent with our expectations in our apartment communities continue to show improved occupancy and rental rates despite the fact that we operate in some of the most competitive apartment markets in the united states 
with the exception of virginia beach  virginia  significant new apartment construction over the past few years has resulted in an oversupply of apartments in our markets 
while the majority of the new apartment communities are asking for rents that are higher than those we receive at our communities  the discounting and specials offered by these new communities as they compete for occupancy limits our ability to significantly raise rents at our communities 
as a result  we do not expect any significant improvement in our apartment markets in in light of this  we will continue to emphasize occupancy as a means of maximizing cash flow from our apartment communities 
we will also strive to maintain our competitive position by keeping the apartment communities in an excellent state of repair and by making selective improvements 
we believe that we have good properties in excellent locations  and that we are well positioned to compete effectively in our markets 
restaurant rental income in was million  a decrease of compared to restaurant rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in the decrease in restaurant rental income is due to the sales of three restaurant properties in june and one restaurant property in june the four restaurants were sold to enterprises  the lessee  under the non economic clause of an agreement that allows enterprises to close up to seven restaurants and buy them back for no less than net carrying value 
we received approximately  as a result of the june restaurant closing 
in january  enterprises notified us of its intention to close and buy back one additional restaurant in may under the lease  restaurant rental payments are the greater of a specified minimum rent or of food sales 
prior to the sales of the four restaurants  the minimum rent was  per year 
the minimum rent is reduced by approximately  per year for each restaurant that is sold 
restaurant rental income in both and was the minimum rent specified in the lease agreement 
same store sales for our restaurants that were open through the entire months of both and declined by in compared to sales at these stores would have to increase by approximately before we would receive rent exceeding the minimum rent 
interest and other income decreased by to  in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a  reduction in interest income due to repayment in february of  in principal on a note receivable from a joint venture partnership 
our interest in the net income of the management company was  in compared to  in effective january   we acquired the minority economic interest and voting interest in the management company 
going forward  we will include the revenues and expenses of our third party management activities in our consolidated revenue and expense amounts 
we do not expect this change to have a significant effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows in future periods 
expenses total expenses  including non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  in were million  an increase of compared to apartment operations expense was million in  an increase of compared to apartment operations expense represented of related apartment rental income  compared to in this increase is primarily attributable to higher costs for compensation of on site staff  taxes  and property insurance 
we reclassified certain and expenses from apartment operations expense to administrative expense to conform to our current classification 
amounts included in apartment operations expense in this annual report represent only direct costs of on site operations for all years presented 
the amounts we reclassified were approximately  for and  for operating expenses for restaurant properties are insignificant because the restaurant properties triple net lease arrangement requires the lessee to pay virtually all of the expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
administrative expense was million in  an increase of compared to we include our apartment property management costs as well as corporate expenses in this line item 
administrative costs were in line with management s expectations 
during  we entered into negotiations for a private equity transaction 
the company terminated those negotiations during the fourth quarter of  and we recorded a charge of  for those costs 
because this is a significant and non recurring charge  we have reported this charge as a separate line item in our statement of operations 
depreciation and amortization totaled million in  an increase of compared to these increases reflect the impact of additions and replacements at apartment communities 
interest expense was million in  an increase of compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the approximate increase in variable interest rates during the first half of overall  weighted average interest rates were in compared to in net income net income available to common shareholders in was million  a decrease of compared to operating partnership earnings before depreciation and amortization in were million  a decrease of  while non cash charges for depreciation and amortization totaled million  an increase of  compared to the minority interest in operating partnership earnings in was  a decrease of compared to net income per share for the year was compared to for the decline in net income was primarily due to increases in interest expense  decrease in restaurant rental income  increases in non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and the significant non recurring charge for the terminated equity transaction 
compared to revenues total revenue in was million  an increase of over this increase is primarily attributable to apartment community acquisitions in and january apartment rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income in was million  an increase of over this increase is primarily the result of apartment community acquisitions 
average economic occupancy for all apartments was in and in average monthly revenue per occupied unit for all apartments was in and in on a same units basis  rental income for apartments owned throughout both years increased 
average economic occupancy for these units was for and in average monthly revenue per occupied unit for these units was in and in restaurant rental income in was million  a decrease of compared to restaurant rental income was the minimum rent for both and the decline in rental income was the result of the sale of three restaurants in excluding the three restaurants that were sold during  restaurant food sales declined for the year

apartment operations expense totaled of related rental income in compared to in on a same units basis  operations expense for apartments owned throughout both years increased in compared to we reclassified certain and expenses from apartment operations expense to administrative expense to conform to our current classification 
amounts included in apartment operations expense in this annual report represent only direct costs of on site operations for all years presented 
the amounts we reclassified were approximately  for and  for apartment operations expenses were generally in line with management s expectations 
the increase in apartment operations expense as a percent of related income is primarily attributable to shortfalls in rental income 
increases in on site personnel compensation  taxes and insurance further increased apartment operations expense as a percent of related income 
operating expenses for restaurant properties are insignificant because the restaurant properties triple net lease arrangement requires the lessee to pay virtually all of the expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
administrative expense was million in  a increase compared to we include our apartment property management costs as well as corporate expenses in this line item 
the increase in administrative costs is generally attributable to additional management and administrative staff and overhead costs corresponding to the addition of apartment communities 
in addition  legal and professional fees expense totaled  in compared to  in  reflecting the increased complexity and costs associated with administration of our upreit structure 
the increases in depreciation and amortization expense are primarily attributable to the addition of apartment communities 
depreciation expense was million in  an increase of compared to for apartment communities owned throughout both years  depreciation expense increased  reflecting the impact of additions and replacements at those communities 
interest expense was million in  an increase of compared to this increase reflects the effect of increased debt related to apartment acquisitions in and early we were able to obtain favorable rates  fixed at rates ranging from to on new debt issues in the second half of  which resulted in weighted average interest rates of in compared to in net income net income available to common shareholders in was million  a decrease of compared to operating partnership earnings before depreciation and amortization in were million  an increase of  while non cash charges for depreciation and amortization totaled million  an increase of compared to the minority interest in operating partnership earnings in was  a decrease of compared to funds from operations funds from operations and funds available for distribution are defined in footnote on page we calculated funds from operations as follows all amounts in thousands income before minority interest and extraordinary item    depreciation    amortization of management intangible funds from operations operating partnership    a reconciliation of funds from operations to funds available for distribution follows all amounts in thousands funds from operations operating partnership    amortization of loan costs recurring capital expenditures   funds available for distribution    a further reconciliation of funds from operations of the operating partnership to basic funds from operations available to common shareholders follows all amounts in thousands funds from operations operating partnership    minority interest in funds from operations    basic funds from operations available to common shareholders    other information about our historical cash flows follows all amounts in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities    dividends and distributions paid to shareholders    minority unitholders in operating partnership    scheduled debt principal payments non recurring capital expenditures acquisition improvements and replacements other apartment property improvements weighted average common shares outstanding    weighted average operating partnership minority units outstanding    funds from operations in before deduction for minority interest totaled million  a decrease of compared to million in the modest increase in contribution from apartment operations was not adequate to offset increases in interest expense  decrease in restaurant rental income  or the significant non recurring costs of a terminated equity transaction 
we operated the same  apartment units throughout both and funds from operations in before deduction for minority interest increased compared to  reflecting the impact of additions to our apartment portfolio 
funds available for distribution totaled million in  a decrease of compared to funds available for distribution totaled million in  an increase of compared to the variance in increases in funds available for distribution compared to increases in funds from operations reflects the impact of recurring capital expenditures for major capital maintenance costs at our older communities 
recurring capital expenditures averaged per apartment unit in  per unit in  and per unit in capital resources and liquidity capital resources in december  we acquired an apartment community for a total cost of approximately million  paid in cash 
we financed this acquisition with a million draw on a variable rate loan secured by a deed of trust on the community and million draws on our lines of credit 
in addition  during  we made draws totaling million on our lines of credit to fund capital improvements at our apartment properties and to redeem common stock and operating partnership minority units 
in june  we received approximately  proceeds from the sale of a restaurant 
we applied this cash to fund capital improvements at our apartment properties 
in january  we acquired an apartment community for a total cost of approximately million 
in conjunction with this acquisition  we made cash payments totaling approximately million  and assumed long term debt and related liabilities totaling million 
we financed this acquisition through draws on our line of credit 
in december  we established a share buy back program that authorized the repurchase and retirement of up to  shares of our common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million 
in early  we repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately  during  we made draws totaling million on our line of credit that is secured by our restaurant properties 
we applied these funds toward our apartment acquisition  the buyback of common stock  and to retire a million note payable to an affiliate 
during  we also entered into a line of credit arrangement that is secured by a deed of trust on latitudes apartments 
we applied a million draw against this line of credit to retire a fixed rate deed of trust loan secured by latitudes apartments 
during june through september  we acquired five apartment communities for a total cost of approximately million 
in conjunction with these acquisitions  we issued operating partnership units with an imputed value of approximately million 
we financed these acquisitions through assumption or issue of fixed rate deed of trust loans totaling million and draws on our line of credit totaling million 
in december and january  we issued million shares of our common stock through a common stock offering 
in january  we received million over allotment proceeds from this offering  which we applied to pay down existing debt 
during and  we issued  shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
in addition  during  we issued  shares of our common stock to affiliates for additional consideration and to retire debt related to previous acquisitions 
during  and  we issued million operating partnership units in conjunction with acquisitions of apartment communities 
holders of operating partnership units will generally be able to redeem their units for cash or  at our option  for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis after one year following issuance 
we intend to pursue our growth strategy through the utilization of our flexible capital structure 
this may include the issuance of operating partnership units  common stock and or preferred stock  additional debt  and joint venture investments 
we may use our lines of credit or fixed rate  long term debt to acquire apartment communities 
cash flows and liquidity net cash flows from operating activities were million in and  and million in investing and financing activities focused primarily on apartment acquisitions and capital expenditures at apartment communities  along with payments of dividends and distributions 
we capitalize expenditures to acquire new assets  to materially enhance the value of existing assets  or to substantially extend the useful life of existing assets 
all floor covering  appliance  and hvac replacements  as well as major capital maintenance expenditures are capitalized 
we have generally funded recurring capital expenditures for apartment properties from cash provided by operating activities 
we paid dividends of per share per quarter in each quarter of   and our dividend payout ratio the ratio of dividends plus distributions paid to operating partnership funds from operations was in  in  and in we intend to pay dividends quarterly  expect that these dividends will substantially exceed the distribution requirement for reits  and anticipate that all dividends will be paid from current funds from operations 
short and long term liquidity requirements at december   total long term debt was million  including million of notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from to  and million at variable rates indexed on day libor rates 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 
a fluctuation in variable interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately  a summary of scheduled principal payments on long term debt is included in the notes to the financial statements in this annual report 
significant scheduled balloon payments include maturities of o our line of credit secured by deeds of trust and assignment of rents of restaurants  due january million outstanding at december   o our lines of credit secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of latitudes apartments  due december up to million  million outstanding at december   o our deed of trust loan for oak hollow apartments phase  due december up to million for acquisition and renovation construction  million outstanding at december  
we continue to produce sufficient cash flow to fund our regular dividend 
however  any number of unforeseen events  or a combination of such events for example  a substantial decline in apartment operations  a substantial increase in short term interest rates  or the sale of the restaurant properties or other assets  might necessitate a reduction in the current dividend 
we generally expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
we believe that net cash provided by operations is  and will continue to be  adequate to meet the reit operating requirements in both the short and the long term 
we anticipate funding our future acquisition activities primarily by using short term credit facilities as an interim measure  to be replaced by funds from equity offerings  long term debt  or joint venture investments 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities 
we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
we received approximately of our revenue in  compared to in and in  from enterprises payment of rent for the use of our restaurant properties 
in addition  enterprises is responsible for all of the costs associated with the maintenance and operations of these properties 
over time  we expect that restaurant rental income will continue to represent a decreasing percentage of our total revenue 
under our current line of credit agreement  enterprises has the right to purchase  under specified terms  up to three additional restaurants deemed non economic for no less than net carrying value 
the annual minimum rent would be reduced by approximately  for each restaurant 
we would receive sale proceeds of the greater of net carrying value or fair value 
as of december   the average net book value of the restaurant properties was approximately  we would most likely apply sale proceeds to reduce outstanding debt on our line of credit 
in january  we received notification of enterprises intention to purchase one additional restaurant property in may enterprises is a privately owned company with total assets exceeding million and net equity exceeding million 
enterprises principal line of business is the operation of approximately hardee s restaurants 
in addition to its hardee s operations  enterprises is the franchisor of texas steakhouse and saloon  a casual dining concept with restaurants 
of these  enterprises owns and operates restaurants  and are owned and operated by franchisees 
enterprises also conducts extensive real estate investment and development activities through bne land and development 
these activities involve a full range of property types  including land  commercial  retail  office  apartment and single family properties 
we have had extensive discussions with management of enterprises and have reviewed enterprises financial statements  cash flow analysis  restaurant contribution analysis  sales trend analysis and projections 
we believe that enterprises will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations under the master lease as well as its general corporate operating needs 
inflation we do not believe that inflation poses a material risk to the company 
the leases at our apartment properties are short term in nature 
none are longer than two years 
the restaurant properties are leased on a triple net basis  which places the risk of rising operating and maintenance costs on the lessee 
environmental matters phase i environmental studies performed on the apartment communities when we acquired each of them did not identify any problems that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
environmental transaction screens for each of the restaurant properties in did not indicate existence of any environmental problems that warranted further investigation 
enterprises has indemnified us for environmental problems associated with the restaurant properties under the master lease 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  as amended by statement no 
and statement no 
 must be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement will require the recognition of all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

at december   total long term debt was million  including million notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from to  and million at variable rates indexed on day libor rates 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was at december   and at december  a change in variable interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately  the table below provides information about our long term debt instruments and presents expected principal maturities and related weighted average interest rates on those instruments all amounts in thousands expected maturity dates later total fixed rate notes    average interest rate expected maturity dates later total variable rate notes    average interest rate we estimate the fair value of fixed rate and variable rate notes using discounted cash flow analysis  based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
the fair value of our notes payable at december   totaled approximately million
