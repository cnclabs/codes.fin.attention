net interest income for the year ended december   was million  as compared with and million reported in the previous two years 
noninterest income  largely from insurance commissions  loan fees  brokerage income and trust and financial services  rose sharply to million in from and million in and  respectively 
the company recorded net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  compared with net income of  or per share diluted  for and net income of million  or per share diluted  for performance highlights in the year included investment securities increased percent  to million reflecting further implementation of the balance sheet leveraging strategy initiated late in total assets increased percent  to million 
loans and leases increased percent  to million 
while net loans outstanding did not increase materially  gross loans originated did as the total loans sold to other financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis increased million  or  to million 
a determined focus by senior management on loan portfolio management resulted in a dramatic improvement in credit quality

results of operations net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income earned on earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the company s primary source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the level of rates paid on those liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information relating to bnc s average balance sheet and reflects the yield on average assets and costs of average liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities 
all average balances have been derived from monthly averages which are indicative of daily averages

a reflecting further implementation of the balance sheet leveraging strategy initiated late in  the company purchased investment securities and funded them with fhlb borrowings 
b loan growth is attributable to increases in loans originated in both the minnesota and north dakota markets 
c the improved loan yield is reflective of prime rate increases in offset by some decreases in loan pricing spread to prime rate due to competitive pressures in all markets 
d the improved investment yield reflects the higher rate environment in as well as the mix of investment types in the company s investment portfolio 
e the increase in investment securities noted in a caused this change in the mix of the earning asset portfolio 
while such a mix change has a negative effect on yield on earning assets because investments typically yield less than loans  the strategy is accretive to earnings 
f deposit growth is primarily attributable to the continued success of the wealthbuilder family of now and money market accounts 
g increased fhlb borrowings for the purpose of purchasing investment securities 
see a above 
h increased cost of interest bearing deposits is reflective of the volume of wealthbuilder now and money market accounts and the associated increases in cost as interest rates rose during the wealthbuilder accounts are indexed to and float with the day t bill rate 
additionally  in a higher rate environment  the cost of certificates of deposit also increases with renewals and new accounts 
i rates are reflective of the overall increased rate environment in as compared to net interest income and margin in future periods are expected to be impacted by several factors 
recent decreases in the prime rate will negatively impact interest income and yields on loans but will positively impact interest expense and the cost of deposits and borrowings 
additionally  the company has increased its earning asset portfolio by purchasing investment securities funded primarily through fhlb borrowings 
while the additional investments have increased interest income  net interest income and earnings  they have negatively impacted yield on earning assets and net interest margin because yields on such investments are typically lower than those achieved in the loan portfolio 
many factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive environment in the markets in which the company operates  the multitude of financial and investment products available to the public and the monetary policies of the frb  can materially impact the company s operating results 
therefore  management cannot predict  with any degree of certainty  prospects for net interest income in future periods

provision for credit losses 
management determines a provision for credit losses which it considers sufficient to maintain the company s allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item and financial condition loan portfolio allowance for credit losses for further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses and the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in and million in noninterest income

a increased insurance commissions in resulted from an increase in the average number of insurance producers as well as successful efforts to cross sell insurance to bank customers 
in  insurance commissions remained relatively stable in spite of a reduction in the number of insurance agents 
b the increase in loan fees is largely attributable to loans originated and sold 
bnc ami also generated some loan fees upon placement of credit into the secondary market 
management cannot predict with any degree of certainty the amount of loans which will be originated or placed and related loan fees which will be recognized in future periods 
c increases are attributable to the addition of brokerage staff at bnc ami and successful efforts to cross sell brokerage services to bank customers 
d the increase is attributable to fees associated with the bnc us opportunities fund llc which was formed on september  and is managed by the bank s financial services division

b the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in real estate mortgage loans originated in minnesota and north dakota 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in real estate construction loans 
although net loans outstanding have not increased materially  gross loans originated by the company have increased significantly as the company has originated and sold portions of loans to other lenders on a nonrecourse basis 
loans may be sold to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed legal lending limits and or internal loan restrictions relating primarily to industry concentrations

success of these products has also contributed to a decrease in the other time deposits category as some customers have elected to transfer maturing time deposits to the more liquid and competitively priced wealthbuilder products 
b brokered deposits totaled million at december  compared to and million at december  and  respectively

investment securities 
bnc s investment policy is designed to enhance net income and return on equity through prudent management of risk  ensure liquidity for cash flow requirements  help manage interest rate risk  ensure collateral is available for public deposits  advances and repurchase agreements and manage asset diversification 
in managing the portfolio  the company seeks a balance among yield and the management of credit and liquidity risks with a goal of maximizing the longer term overall profitability of the company 
investments are centrally managed in order to maximize compliance federal laws and regulations place certain restrictions on the amounts and types of investments bnc may hold and effectiveness of overall investing activities 
the primary goal of bnc s investment policy is to contribute to the overall profitability of the company 
the objective is to purchase and own securities and combinations of securities with good risk reward characteristics 
good risk reward securities are those identified through thorough analysis of the cash flows and potential cash flows as well as market value and potential market value of the security in question given various interest rate scenarios 
investment strategies are developed in light of constant view of the company s overall asset liability position 
as it relates to investment strategies  the focus of the asset liability management committee is to determine the impact of interest rate changes on both future income and market value of securities in the portfolio

as of december   bnc had million of securities in the investment portfolio as compared to and million at december  and  respectively 
during  the company increased its holdings in agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  us government agency mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds by   and million  respectively 
the increased volume of these sectors and the portfolio as a whole is part of the company s strategy to increase its earning asset portfolio by purchasing investment securities funded primarily through fhlb borrowings 
the portfolio management process  investment objectives  and risk reward analysis described above led the increase in the investment portfolio to be over weighted toward cmos due to their risk reward characteristics 
in addition  over the course of  principal cash flows were primarily reinvested in cmos because they offered a better risk reward profile due to the structure of the cmo cash flows relative to mortgage backed securities 
at december   bnc held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities and agency mortgage backed securities and cmos  that exceeded ten percent of stockholders equity 
a significant portion of the company s investment securities portfolio approximately percent at december  was pledged as collateral for public deposits and borrowings  including borrowings with the fhlb

b increased originations of commercial real estate construction loans 
c as previously noted  net loans outstanding have not increased significantly in the last months  however  this is not reflective of the loans originated by the company which totaled million at december  compared with and million at december  and  respectively 
loans are originated and sold for legal lending limit  concentration and other reasons 
see loan participations 
while prospects for continued loan growth appear favorable  management cannot predict with any degree of certainty the company s future loan growth potential 
credit policy and approval procedures 
bnc follows a uniform credit policy that sets forth underwriting and loan administration criteria 
the loan policy  including lending guidelines for the various types of credit offered by the company  is established by the board of directors the board based upon the recommendations of senior lending management and credit committees 
the loan policy is reviewed and reaffirmed by the board at least annually 
underwriting criteria are based upon the risks associated with each type of credit offered  the related borrowers and types of collateral 
the company delegates lending decision authority among various lending officers and the credit committees based on the size of the customer s credit relationship with bnc 
all loans and commitments approved in excess of  are presented to the board on a monthly basis for summary review 
any exceptions to loan policies and guidelines  to the extent the credit relationship amount exceeds individual loan officer lending authorities  are subject to special approval by bank executive lenders or the credit committees 
loan participations 
pursuant to bnc s lending policy  loans may not exceed percent of bank legal lending limits except to the extent collateralized by us treasury securities or bank deposits and  accordingly  excluded from the bank s legal lending limit 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed lending limits and internal loan restrictions relating primarily to industry concentration  the bank sells loan participations to outside participants without recourse 
loan participations sold on a nonrecourse basis to outside financial institutions were as follows as of the dates indicated loan participations sold december  in thousands from continuing operations for all periods presented 
the bank generally retains the right to service the loans as well as the right to receive a portion of the interest income on the loans 
many of the loans sold by the bank are commercial lines of credit for which balances and related payment streams cannot be reasonably estimated in order to determine the fair value of the servicing rights and or future interest income retained by the bank 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further discussion of accounting policies related to loans 
management cannot reliably predict bnc s ability to continue to generate or sell loan participations or the terms of any such sales 
concentrations of credit 
the company s credit policies emphasize diversification of risk among industries  geographic areas and borrowers 
for purposes of the analysis of concentrations of credit as of december  the total outstanding loans as well as all outstanding loan commitments were included 
as of december   the company identified three concentrations of loans exceeding ten percent of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
these concentrations were in real estate  lodging places and construction  which represented  and percent  respectively  of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
the real estate loans and commitments were extended to customers who are diversified across the company s market areas and who can be generally categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding loans number of and loan customers commitments non residential and apartment building operators  developers and lessors of real property real estate holding companies total the lodging loans and commitments were extended to customers whose properties are located throughout the united states 
loans in this category are made to borrowers that have seasoned hotel portfolios that are well diversified by location  property type and flag 
loans and commitments in the construction category were extended to customers who are located primarily in minnesota  iowa and north and south dakota and who can be generally categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding loans number of and loan customers commitments general building contractors heavy construction  excluding building special trade contractors total the contractors are involved in various aspects of the construction industry  including highway and street construction  water sewer drilling  plumbing  heating and air conditioning  commercial painting  electrical  concrete and excavating and foundation contractors 
loans in this category are secured  in many cases  by construction equipment 
the company continually monitors industry and other credit concentrations as part of its credit risk management strategies 
in cases where significant concentrations exist without sufficient diversification and other mitigating factors  bnc generally sells loans without recourse to outside financial institutions 
agricultural loans 
bnc s agricultural loan portfolio totals approximately million  or percent of total loans at december  within the portfolio  loans are diversified by type and include loans to grain and or livestock producers  agricultural real estate loans  machinery and equipment and other types of loans 
the majority of the company s agricultural loans are extended to borrowers located in north dakota  and are diversified over several counties 
the company has been monitoring its agricultural loans closely 
as of december   there were no agricultural loans classified as nonperforming 
loan maturities 
the following table sets forth the remaining maturities of loans in each major category of bnc s portfolio as of december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications maturities of loans over year through years over years one year fixed floating fixed floating or less rate rate rate rate total in thousands commercial and industrial       real estate mortgage       real estate construction     agricultural       consumer other     lease financing   total face amount of loans       maturities are based upon contractual maturities 
floating rate loans include loans that would reprice prior to maturity if base rates change 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further discussion regarding repricing of loans and other assets 
interest rate floors 
from time to time the company may use off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate floors  to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of on balance sheet items  including loans 
see liquidity  market and credit risk  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further discussion about accounting policies applicable to derivative financial instruments and currently outstanding instruments 
nonperforming loans and assets 
bnc s lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the quality of the loan portfolio 
officer compensation depends  to a substantial extent  on maintaining loan quality and dealing with credit issues in a timely and proactive manner 
lenders are not compensated for growth at the expense of credit quality 
loan officers are responsible for ongoing and regular review of past due loans in their respective portfolios 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly and examined by the company s loan review personnel 
loans demonstrating weaknesses are downgraded in a timely fashion and the board receives a listing of all such loans on a monthly basis 
the following table sets forth  as of the dates indicated  the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets  the allowance for credit losses and certain related ratios nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual loans   restructured loans 
total nonperforming loans    other real estate owned and repossessed assets   total nonperforming assets    allowance for credit losses      ratio of total non performing loans to total loans 




ratio of total non performing assets to total assets 



from continuing operations for all periods presented 
if the company s nonaccrual and restructured loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  bnc would have recognized additional interest income of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans actually included in the company s net income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company achieved significant improvement in the level of nonperforming loans and assets during a determined focus by senior management on loan portfolio management resulted in a dramatic improvement in credit quality 
loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest include loans over days past due which management believes  based on its specific analysis of the loans  do not present doubt about the collection of interest and principal in accordance with the loan contract 
loans in this category must be well secured and in the process of collection 
these loans are monitored closely by bnc lending and management personnel 
nonaccrual loans include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
accrual of interest is discontinued when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to the current reporting period is reversed against interest income of the current period 
accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to previous reporting periods is charged against the allowance for credit losses 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including a reduction of the interest rate or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of its original principal will occur 
other real estate owned and repossessed assets represents properties and other assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure 
such properties and assets are included in other assets in the balance sheets 
they are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition establishing a new cost basis 
write downs to fair value at the time of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and the real estate or assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
write downs  revenues and expenses incurred subsequent to foreclosure are charged to operations as recognized incurred 
potential problem loans 
in accordance with accounting standards  the company identifies loans considered impaired and the valuation allowance attributable to these loans 
impaired loans generally include loans on which management believes  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and which are analyzed for a specific reserve allowance 
bnc generally considers all loans risk graded substandard and doubtful as well as nonaccrual and restructured loans as impaired 
impaired loans at december   not including the past due  nonaccrual and restructured loans reported above  totaled million 
a significant portion of these loans are not in default but may have characteristics such as recent adverse operating cash flows or general risk characteristics that the loan officer feels might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the ultimate resolution of these credits is subject to changes in economic conditions and other factors 
these loans are closely monitored to ensure that the company s position as creditor is protected to the fullest extent possible 
allowance for credit losses 
bnccorp maintains an allowance for credit losses sufficient to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is adjusted through the provision for credit losses  which is charged to income 
at yearend  the company s total allowance was million which equates to approximately times the average charge offs for the last three and five years  and and times the average net charge offs for the same three and five year periods  respectively 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  the company also gives consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
the company s charge off policy is generally consistent with regulatory standards 
the three components to the allowance for credit losses  the specific allowance  allocated allowance and unallocated allowance  are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item a comprehensive analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is performed by the company on a quarterly basis 
additionally  peer review of allowance levels of other financial institutions is conducted on an annual basis 
historically  senior lending management in each of bnccorp s banking subsidiaries has been responsible for assessing the adequacy of the respective subsidiary s allowance for credit losses and making provision for credit losses recommendations to the appropriate board of directors 
the company recently established an allowance for credit losses review committee the review committee  which now has the responsibility of affirming allowance methodology  performing an annual credit loss migration analysis and assessing the allowance components in relation to estimated and actual charge off trends 
certain members of the review committee are responsible for assessing and reporting on the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses as well as recommending revisions to the company s methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance as they become necessary 
concentrations of credit risk are discussed under concentrations of credit 
concentrations exist in real estate  lodging and construction loans and commitments 
additionally  a geographic concentration of credit risk also arises because bnccorp operates primarily in the upper midwest with percent of loans outstanding as of december  having been extended to customers in minnesota  north dakota and south dakota 
other groups of credit risk may not constitute a significant concentration  but are analyzed based on other evident risk factors for the purpose of determining an adequate allowance level 
nonperforming and potential problem loans are defined and discussed under nonperforming loans and assets and potential problem loans 
nonperforming loans decreased from million at december  to  at december  many of these loans are specifically analyzed for purposes of determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
estimating the risk and amount of loss on any loan is subjective and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
although management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual credit losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of the company s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require bnc to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

capital resources and expenditures 
bnc s management actively monitors compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  including risk based and leverage capital measures 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital

bnc is a party to transactions involving financial instruments that create risks that may or may not be reflected on a traditional balance sheet 
these financial instruments can be subdivided into three categories cash financial instruments  generally characterized as on balance sheet items  include investments  loans  mortgage based securities  deposits and other debt obligations 
credit related financial instruments  generally characterized as off balance sheet items  include such instruments as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
derivative financial instruments  until january  generally characterized as off balance sheet items  include such instruments as interest rate  foreign exchange  commodity price and equity price contracts  including forwards  swaps and options 
the company s risk management policies are intended to monitor and limit exposure to liquidity  market and credit risks that arise from each of these financial instruments 
see loan portfolio for a discussion of the company s credit risk management strategies 
liquidity risk management 
liquidity risk management encompasses the company s ability to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
the objectives of liquidity management policies are to maintain adequate liquid assets  liability diversification among instruments  maturities and customers and a presence in both the wholesale purchased funds market and the retail deposit market 
the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements included under item present data on cash and cash equivalents provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities 
in addition to liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  bnc utilizes brokered deposits  sells securities under agreements to repurchase and borrows overnight federal funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlb  which affords it the opportunity to borrow funds in terms ranging from overnight to ten years and beyond 
borrowings from the fhlb are generally collateralized by the bank s mortgage loans and various investment securities 
see investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item the company has also obtained funding through the issuance of its subordinated notes and trust preferred securities

bnc s liquidity is measured by its ability to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost and with a minimum of loss 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as the company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity is supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines with the fhlb  credit lines with correspondent banks for federal funds  wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  brokered certificates of deposit and direct non brokered national certificates of deposit through national deposit networks 
bnc s management measures its liquidity position on a monthly basis 
key factors that determine the company s liquidity are the reliability or stability of its deposit base  the pledged nonpledged status of its investments and potential loan demand 
bnc s liquidity management system divides the balance sheet into liquid assets  and short term liabilities that are assumed to be vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities is measured over a day planning horizon 
assumptions for short term liabilities vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions are based on a historical analysis of the month to month percentage changes in deposits 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities and other key factors such as expected loan demand as well as access to other sources of liquidity such as lines with the fhlb  federal funds  and those other supplemental sources listed above are tied together to provide a measure of the company s liquidity 
management has a targeted range and manages its operations such that these targets can be achieved 
management believes that its prudent management policies and guidelines will ensure adequate levels of liquidity to fund anticipated needs of on and off balance sheet items 
in addition  a contingency funding policy statement identifies actions to be taken in response to an adverse liquidity event 
forward looking statements statements included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company cautions readers that forward looking statements  including without limitation  those relating to the company s future business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs and income  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements due to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to risks of loans and investments  including dependence on local economic conditions  competition for the company s customers from other providers of financial services  possible adverse effects of changes in interest rates  risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  and other risks which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
effects of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  banking organizations do not necessarily gain or lose due to the effects of inflation 
changes in interest rates  which are a major determinant of a financial service organization s profitability  do not necessarily correspond to changes in the prices of goods and services 
an analysis of a banking organization s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates and maintain profitability 
the financial statements and supplementary financial data have been prepared  primarily  on a historical basis which is mandated by generally accepted accounting principles 
fluctuations in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on the company s earnings or value 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk can result from re pricing risk timing differences in the maturity re pricing of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  options risk the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  basis risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more different rates of similar maturity  and the resulting impact on the behavior of lending and funding rates  and yield curve risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more rates of different maturities from the same type of instrument 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
to date the company has not conducted trading activities as a means of managing interest rate risk 
bnc s asset liability management process is utilized to manage the company s interest rate risk 
the measurement of interest rate risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
interest rate risk exposure is actively managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on current earnings and on the market value of equity 
in general  the assets and liabilities generated through ordinary business activities do not naturally create offsetting positions with respect to repricing or maturity characteristics 
access to the derivatives market can be an important element in maintaining the company s interest rate risk position within policy guidelines 
using off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate floors and caps  the interest rate sensitivity of specific on balance sheet transactions  as well as pools of assets or liabilities  is adjusted to maintain the desired interest rate risk profile 
see loan portfolio interest rate floors and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of the company s accounting policies pertaining to such instruments 
the company s primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk is net interest income simulation 
this exercise includes management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products savings  now  money market and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
interest rate caps and floors are included to the extent that they are exercised in the month simulation period 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of the residential mortgage and mortgage backed securities portfolios in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
finally  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that the company will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not entirely possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the overall level of net interest income 
the company monitors the results of net interest income simulation on a monthly basis at regularly scheduled asset liability management committee meetings 
each month net interest income is simulated for the upcoming month horizon in seven interest scenarios 
the scenarios modeled are parallel interest ramps of bp  bp  and bp along with a rates unchanged scenario 
the parallel movement of interest rates means all projected market interest rates move up or down by the same amount 
a ramp in interest rates means that the projected change in market interest rates occurs over the month horizon projected 
for example  in the bp scenario  the projected prime rate will increase from its starting point at december  of percent to percent months later 
the prime rate in this example will increase th of the overall increase of basis points each month 
the net interest income simulation results for the month horizon that covers the calendar year of is shown below 
the growth assumption used for this simulation was based on the growth projections built into the company s budget 
the impact of each interest rate scenario on projected net interest income is displayed before and after the impact of the million notional interest rate floor on the prime rate with an percent strike 
net interest income simulation amounts in thousands movement in interest rates bp bp bp unchanged bp bp bp projected month net interest income        dollar change from rates unchanged scenario percentage change from rates unchanged scenario cost of mm floor total net interest income impact with floor        dollar change from flat w floor  percentage change from unchanged w floor benefit from amortization of deferred gain on sale of interest rate swap total net interest income impact w floor swap gain        dollar change from flat w floor swap  percentage change from flat w floor swap policy limits in september  the company purchased an interest rate floor 
the notional amount of the floor is million with a maturity date of september  the floor s reference rate is the prime rate with a strike of percent 
the company paid a premium of  or per million 
through december   the premium was being amortized on a straight line basis 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see loan portfolio interest rate floors and note and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial investments 
the swap was sold in the gain recognized upon sale of the swap is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the original swap contract 
the company s rate sensitivity position over the projected twelve month horizon is liability sensitive 
this is evidenced by the projected decrease of net interest income in the rising interest rate scenarios  and the increase in net interest income in falling rate scenarios 
the primary reason for this interest rate risk profile is the growth of the wealthbuilder deposit products along with the continued growth in these products that is projected into  as well as the growth and mix of components of the asset side of the balance sheet 
the company s general policy is to limit the percentage change in projected net interest income to   and from the rates unchanged scenario for the bp  bp  and bp interest rate ramp scenarios  respectively 
the company was within its policy limits for each projected scenario in the table above 
static gap analysis is another tool which may be used for interest rate risk measurement 
the net differences between the amount of assets  liabilities  equity and off balance sheet instruments repricing within a cumulative calendar period is typically referred to as the rate sensitivity position or gap position 
the following table sets forth the company s rate sensitivity position as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever occurs first interest sensitivity gap analysis estimated maturity or repricing at december  over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash equivalents investment securities      fixed rate loans      floating rate loans 
     total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now and money market accounts   savings   time deposits under time deposits  and over     borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities 
    interest rate gap      cumulative interest rate gap at december  cumulative interest rate gap to total assets investment securities are generally reported in the timeframe representing the earliest of repricing date  call date for callable securities  estimated life or maturity date 
estimated lives of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on published industry prepayment estimates for securities with comparable weighted average interest rates and contractual maturities 
loans are stated gross of the allowance for credit losses and are placed in the earliest timeframe in which maturity or repricing may occur 
the table assumes that all savings and interest bearing demand deposits reprice in the earliest period presented  however  bnc s management believes a significant portion of these accounts constitute a core component and are generally not rate sensitive 
management s position is supported by the fact that aggressive reductions in interest rates paid on these deposits historically has not caused notable reductions in balances 
the table does not necessarily indicate the future impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
static gap analysis does not fully capture the impact of embedded options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  or certain off balance sheet sensitivities to interest rate movements 
therefore  this tool cannot be used in isolation to determine the level of interest rate risk exposure in more complex banking institutions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  these analyses are not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of changes in market interest rates such as those indicated above on the company 
further  this analysis is based on the company s assets and liabilities as of december  with forward adjustments for planned growth and anticipated business activities and does not contemplate any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates
