general we provide hardware and software based data storage solutions to the open systems marketplace 
our storage solutions integrate into a wide range of rapidly evolving network computing environments and are designed to enable organizations to organize  protect and retrieve complex mission critical data 
we design  manufacture  sell and support specialized data storage hardware and software products and provide related services 
currently  we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of storage libraries and related service and support 
as a result of our investments in software development  we expect sales of our proprietary software products to increase in the future 
we distribute our products primarily through value added resellers vars  distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems  and we also sell directly to large end users 
our general trends include significant growth in our north american core business of mid range data storage products  growth in our oem business and a reduction in sales of standalone digital linear tape dlt drives 
gross margins have increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal due to volume increases and a reduction in sales of the lower margin products 
gross profit margins depend on a number of factors  including customer and product mix  price competition and tape drive costs 
we expect that continued growth in sales to oems may cause our gross profit margins to decrease in fiscal in august  we acquired emass  inc for million in cash and the assumption of million in indebtedness  and expensed million of acquired in process research and development 
emass established our presence in denver and expanded our operations in europe 
this acquisition brought with it certain product offerings  including large scale libraries and proprietary software products designed to operate in conjunction with our hardware products and the hardware products of our competitors 
additionally  we gained a field service organization which now serves our combined business

foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of our operation of european subsidiaries  the functional currencies of which are the french franc  german mark and british pound sterling 
all monetary assets are translated into the functional currencies on the financial statements of these subsidiaries 
some us dollar receivables and payables in these subsidiaries offset each other to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses 
to the extent that these monetary assets and liabilities do not fully offset each other and the us dollar exchange rate changes with respect to these currencies  transaction gains or losses may result 
for large sales denominated in other currencies  we attempt to implement appropriate hedging strategies 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal strong sales growth of faststor and scalar products in both branded and oem business account for most of the growth 
this was offset in part by reductions in sales of larger libraries and associated service revenues in europe 
the reduction in european sales results in part from the strength of the dollar compared to the european currencies 
revenue from branded products increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal revenue from oems was million or of total revenue for fiscal and million or of total revenue for fiscal revenue from a single oem was of net sales in fiscal these oem sales consisted primarily of the small library faststor products 
net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases are due primarily to a combination of product mix and overall volume increase in higher margin tape libraries 
however  increased oem revenue is expected to have a negative effect on gross margin in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases are due to a combination of increased sales and administrative personnel both in the headquarters office and in regional offices  and marketing costs associated with launching new products and penetrating into new sales channels 
we expect to continue increasing spending levels as opportunities are identified 
acquired in process technology 
in connection with the acquisition of mountaingate in fiscal  acquired in process technology of million was identified and valued by an independent third party appraisal and was expensed immediately 
the value of acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the stage of development of in process research and development projects at the date of acquisition and estimating cash flows resulting from anticipated revenues generated from such projects  and then discounting the projected net cash flow 
in fiscal  we continued to incur significant engineering time and material costs to develop the acquired in process technology into a commercially viable product

during fiscal  we eliminated the valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets due to our belief that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased to million compared with net sales of million in fiscal this increase reflects the recognition of revenue associated with the emass business for all of fiscal compared with recognition for two months of fiscal  as well as strong sales growth across our major product lines in both our branded products and oem business 
revenue from branded products increased in fiscal to million 
revenue from oems was million or of total revenue for fiscal and million or of total revenue for fiscal revenue from a single oem was in fiscal these oem sales consisted primarily of the small library faststor products 
net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the increase was due to a shift in product mix toward higher margin tape libraries  software and service  and away from lower margin standalone tape drives and media  as well as the effects of overall volume increases 
gross profit in fiscal was adversely impacted by higher overhead with our new washington facility  increases in personnel to support our oem business  and lower than anticipated product revenues 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to increased sales and administrative personnel both in the headquarters office and in regional offices throughout the united states and increased advertising and promotion costs

there were significant deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences associated with subsidiaries acquired in the emass transaction 
at october   a full valuation allowance had been established on these deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that we could realize the deferred tax assets and consequently reduced the previously established valuation allowance by million 
we reduced the valuation of certain noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition by the same amount 
at october   we had a valuation allowance of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows used in operating activities were million for fiscal  while in fiscal and  million and million were provided by operations 
in fiscal  proceeds from the sale of equity securities of million are included in cash flows from investing activities 
taxes associated with the related gains of million were paid via estimated tax payments during fiscal and are included as a component of cash flow used in operating activities 
the cash provided by income taxes payable of million reflects the difference of the provision for income taxes and the actual taxes paid 
in each of the three years  operating cash was used to fund increases in accounts receivable and inventories and was offset by net income  depreciation and other allowances and accounts payable growth 
additionally  in fiscal and  net income was reduced by the expensing of acquired in process technology  a noncash item 
other noncash items in fiscal and include increases in the allowance for inventory obsolescence of million and million  respectively 
as our installed base of library products has increased  the need for service and warranty repair inventory  especially inventory at regional locations to support on site service  has also increased 
we have provided an allowance against these inventories  as well as for inventories used for demonstration purposes  in addition to our allowance for excess and obsolescence 
because these inventories can remain in the field for an extended time  the amount of this allowance has increased substantially over the past two years 
cash flows provided by investing activities was million in fiscal cash flows used in investing activities were million for fiscal and million for fiscal fiscal reflects the proceeds associated with our sale of crossroads systems  inc securities as well as an investment in marketable equity securities of million

a credit agreement covers the line of credit and long term note payable and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios and levels of working capital  tangible net worth and profitability 
we had no material or unusual commitments as of october  other than annual rental commitments 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  bank line of credit  and anticipated cash flow from our operating activities  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we may utilize cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that we believe are strategic 
we regularly evaluate other companies and technologies for possible acquisition by us

recent accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
fas defers the effective date until the fiscal year ending october  we will adopt fas in our quarter ending january  and do not expect such adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
this pronouncement summarizes certain of the sec staff s views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
we are required to adopt sab for our fiscal year ending october  we do not expect that the adoption of sab will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we may enter into various derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar  and are translated in us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
a depreciation in the us dollar would result in an approximately million decrease in income before provision for income taxes for fiscal at october   we had variable rate debt of approximately million provided by german banks  and fixed rate debt of million  also provided by a german bank 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet at october  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement on the variable rate debt  which fixes the interest rate at 
interest on the fixed rate debt is impact of european monetary conversion we are aware of the issues associated with the changes in europe resulting from the formation of a european economic and monetary union 
one change resulting from this union required european monetary union  or emu  member states to irrevocably fix their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro  as of january   at which date the euro became a functional legal currency of these countries 
during the next three years  business in the emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency  such as the french franc or the german mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
we have committed to the worldwide implementation of a fully integrated enterprise resource planning information system 
this system will be implemented in europe in fiscal and will provide us the capability to meet the requirements of the emu 
the majority of the costs of this system were incurred in connection with the north america installation  we expect that additional costs will be approximately million
