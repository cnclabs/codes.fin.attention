the company also administers self insured plans for large employer groups 
coventry was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on december  and is the successor to coventry corporation  which was incorporated on november  the company s commercial managed care premium revenues during the three years ended december  were comprised of premiums from its commercial hmo products and flexible provider products  including ppo and pos products for which the company assumes full underwriting risk 
premiums for such commercial ppo and pos products are typically lower than hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and copayments that are required from the ppo and pos members 
premium rates for commercial hmo products are reviewed by various state agencies based on rate filings 
while the company has not had such filings modified  no assurance can be given that approvals for rate submissions will continue 
the public sector managed care premium revenues consist of premiums from the company s medicare and medicaid products 
the company provides comprehensive health benefits to members participating in government programs and receives premium payments from federal and state governments 
premium rates for the medicaid and medicare products are established by governmental regulatory agencies and may be reduced by regulatory action 
during the three years ended december   the company experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due primarily to membership increases 
much of the growth was in and was attributable to the acquisition of the principal health care  inc phc health plans effective april  additional membership growth was achieved through marketing efforts  acquisitions  geographic expansion and increased product offerings 
one such product offering is the expansion of the company s ppo risk product to all of its health plans in the company s management services revenues result from operations in which the company s health plans provide administrative and other services to self insured employers and to employer group beneficiaries that have elected hmo coverage 
the company receives an administrative fee for these services  but does not assume underwriting risk 
in addition  the company offers a ppo product to other third party payors  under which it provides rental of and access to the company s ppo network  claims repricing and utilization review  and does not assume underwriting risk 
a significant portion of the company s management services revenue in and was a result of the acquisition of certain phc health plans from principal life insurance company principal life 
the company recognized revenue under a marketing services agreement  management services agreement and ppo access agreement with principal life 
these agreements have either expired or have been terminated as of december  as of december   coventry had  members for whom it assumes underwriting risk risk members and  members of self insured employers for whom it provides management services but does not assume underwriting risk non risk members in continuing operations

louis       west virginia     wichita   total       for january  the company added about  members to december results 
commercial risk membership grew by about  members primarily due to the acquisition of health partners of the midwest s health partners commercial membership  in our st 
louis market  offset by the loss of one large group 
medicare membership decreased by about  due to the loss of membership resulting from a change in benefits 
medicaid membership increased by about  members mainly due to normal growth in the healthcare usa plan 
the remaining  member increase was a result of modest growth in non risk membership due to the health partners acquisition offset by several large group terminations 
coventry s operating expenses are primarily medical costs  including medical claims under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers  and capitation payments 
medical claims expense also includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
coventry currently believes that the estimates for ibnr liabilities are adequate to satisfy its ultimate medical claims liability after all medical claims have been reported 
in determining the company s ibnr liabilities  coventry employs plan by plan standard actuarial reserve methods specific to the plan s membership  product characteristics  geographic territories and provider network that consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient  outpatient  pharmacy and other medical costs  as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements 
reserve estimates are reviewed by underwriting  finance and accounting  and other appropriate plan and corporate personnel and judgments are then made as to the necessity for reserves in addition to the estimated amounts 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience  changes in the delivery system  changes in pricing due to ancillary capitation and fluctuations in the claims backlog could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
coventry continually monitors and reviews its ibnr reserves  and as actual settlements are made or accruals adjusted  reflects these differences in current operations

effective june   coventry amended these agreements with principal life and waived its rights to reinsure and renew principal life s health insurance indemnity business located in coventry s service area

given the short time period between the respective acquisition and sale dates and the lack of events or other evidence which would indicate differing values  no gain or loss was recognized on the sales of the florida and illinois health plans  as the sale prices were considered by management to be equivalent to the fair values allocable to these plans at the date of their acquisition from principal life in april in connection with the acquisition of certain phc health plans and the sales of the florida and illinois plans  coventry established reserves of approximately million for the estimated transition costs of the phc health plans

legal proceedings in the normal course of business  the company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the company  medical malpractice actions  and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
with respect to medical malpractice  the company carries professional malpractice and general liability insurance for each of its operations on a claims made basis with varying deductibles for which the company maintains reserves 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
other managed care companies have been sued recently in class action lawsuits claiming violations of the federal racketeering act  racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico  and the employee retirement income security act of erisa  and generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care 
although it is possible that the company may be the target of a similar suit  the company believes there is no valid basis for such a suit 
the company s industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could have significant effect on the company s operations 
comparison of to managed care premium revenues increased in over as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout both years and as a result of member growth  both organic and through acquisitions 
premium rate increasing by an average of over on a per member per month pmpm basis  to pmpm is the primary reason for the increased revenues 
coventry will continue to be diligent in attempting to obtain adequate premium increases and expects premium rates to increase more than for renewals in the first quarter of the acquisitions that contributed to the increase in premium revenues occurred in the fourth quarter of and in the first  third  and fourth quarters of membership  and thus premium revenues  in the medicare and medicaid program continues to grow not only through acquisitions  but also organically 
more than half of the increase in governmental program membership came from growth in existing markets 
management services revenue decreased in from the prior year as a result of the expiration of the ppo access  marketing services and management services agreements with principal life 
the expiration of these agreements was anticipated and was offset by reduced sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue  premium rate increases and strategic acquisitions 
medical expense increased in compared to due almost equally to the additional expenses associated with acquisitions and medical trends 
despite the increase in expense  the medical loss ratio  excluding charges  decreased to from in due to medical expenses increasing at a lessor pace than that of premium rates 
medical claim liability accruals are continually monitored and reviewed  with differences for actual settlements from reserves reflected in current operations 
in addition to the procedures for determining reserves as discussed above  the company reviews the actual payout of claims relating to prior period accruals  which may take more than six months to develop fully 
medical costs are affected by a variety of factors  including the severity and frequency of claims  that are difficult to predict and may not be entirely within the company s control 
the company continually refines its actuarial practices to incorporate new cost events and trends 
sg a expense increased due primarily to the additional expense associated with the acquired carelink  primeone  maxicare and wellpath health plans 
sg a expense  as a percent of revenue  decreased to in  compared to in due to improved operational efficiencies driven by the consolidation of eighteen service centers into three regional service centers and continued management scrutiny of administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to intangible assets relating to the principal health plan acquisition that were fully amortized by the end of the decrease of intangible asset amortization was partially offset by an increase in amortization of goodwill relating to acquisitions and an increase in computer software and hardware depreciation 
other income  net of interest expense  increased in from due to increased investment income as a result of an increase in the company s long term investments compared to the prior year 
the company incurred no interest expense in due to the extinguishment of all outstanding debt in comparison of to managed care premium revenues increased in over primarily due to the additional revenue associated with the acquisitions of carelink and the kfhpnc membership in the fourth quarter of and also due to the increase in medicare and medicaid membership of  or  in continuing markets 
in addition to the increase in risk membership  premiums increased by an average of  or  over on a pmpm basis  to pmpm  as a result of rate increases 
the medicare and medicaid programs continued to grow in existing markets through expanded programs 
on a same store basis  the increase in medicare and medicaid membership was offset by a decrease in commercial membership of  or 
the decrease in commercial membership occurred primarily in the western pennsylvania market  attributable to the disruption caused by the aherf bankruptcy filing and the conversion of a large group from a commercial risk product to a self funded product 
membership also decreased in other markets due to coventry s efforts to adhere to a strict pricing discipline 
management services revenue increased in from primarily due to an increase in self funded membership of  or  including the conversion of a large group from a commercial risk product to a self funded product 
medical expense increased in compared to due primarily to the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions of carelink and kfhpnc membership 
exclusive of the carelink and kfhpnc transactions  health benefits expense decreased million 
coventry s medical loss ratio decreased slightly to from in due to premium rate increases  which were a result of coventry s efforts to maintain a strict pricing discipline 
sg a expense  as a percent of revenue  remained unchanged at in  compared to the increase in sg a expense was primarily attributable to additional expense associated with the acquired carelink health plan and coventry s consolidation of eighteen service centers into three regional service centers 
in an effort to control costs and improve customer service  coventry transferred certain of its operating activities eg  customer service  claims processing  billing and enrollment to regional service centers 
depreciation and amortization increased compared to primarily as a result of the depreciation related to the net capital expenditures of million in and the additional amortization related to the intangibles recorded as part of the acquisition of the phc health plans in april other income  net of interest expense  increased from  primarily due to the reduction of interest expense from the reduction of debt and increased investment income resulting from the increase in invested assets subsequent to the acquisition of the phc health plans 
liquidity and capital resources the company s total cash and investments  excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the company s million of net earnings excluding depreciation and amortization 
the increase was also due in part to the cash and investments acquired of million  net of purchase price  net worth and transactions costs  for acquisitions of primeone  maxicare  and wellpath in the year the company s investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide short term liquidity and minimize the risk to principal 
the company believes that since its long term investments are available for sale  the amount of such investments should be added to current assets when assessing the company s working capital and liquidity 
on such basis  current assets plus long term investments available for sale less current liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  the company s hmos and its insurance company subsidiary  coventry health and life insurance company ch l  are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the company may receive from its hmos and its insurance company subsidiary 
after giving effect to these statutory reserve requirements  the company s hmo subsidiaries had surplus in excess of statutory requirements of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
if all states adopt a policy that would require the health plans to maintain a statutory reserve equal to of their risk based capital rbc  the company s hmo subsidiaries would have a surplus in excess of statutory requirements of approximately million at december  ch l had surplus in excess of statutory requirements of approximately million and million at december  and amended  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to statutory rbc requirements changing from to of authorized control level rbc 
excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation  the company had cash and investments of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  which are available to pay intercompany balances to regulated subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes 
the company also has entered into agreements with certain of its regulated subsidiaries to provide additional capital if necessary to prevent the subsidiary s impairment of net worth requirements 
during the quarter ended june   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement warburg agreement with warburg  pincus ventures  lp warburg and franklin capital associates iii  lp franklin for the purchase of million of the company s convertible exchangeable senior subordinated notes coventry notes  together with warrants to purchase million shares of the company s common stock for million 
the original amounts of the coventry notes  million held by warburg and million held by franklin  were exchangeable at the company s or warburg s option for shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
during the second and third quarters of  the company converted all coventry notes held by warburg and franklin totaling million  including accumulated interest  into  shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock at a price of per share 
the preferred stock was convertible to common stock on a share for share basis  subject to adjustment for anti dilution  and was callable by the company if the market price of the company s common stock exceeded certain agreed upon targets 
on july   franklin converted all of its  shares of preferred stock into  shares of common stock of the company on a one for one basis as adjusted for anti dilution in january on december   warburg converted all of its  shares of preferred stock into  shares of common stock of the company on a one for one basis adjusted for anti dilution  thus eliminating all outstanding shares of preferred stock 
projected capital investments in of approximately million consist primarily of computer hardware  software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communications systems 
the company believes that cash flows generated from operations  cash and investments  and excess funds in certain of its regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through december  share repurchase program on december   the company announced a program to purchase up to of its outstanding common stock 
stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market  by block purchase or in private transactions 
the company purchased  and  shares of its common stock in and  respectively  for the treasury at an aggregate cost of million and million in and  respectively 
coventry had approximately million diluted shares of common stock outstanding as of december  legislation and regulation numerous proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to health care reform 
some proposals  if enacted  could among other things  restrict the company s ability to raise prices and to contract independently with employers and providers 
certain reform proposals favor the growth of managed health care  while others would adversely affect managed care 
although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time  management of the company believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations in the short term 
litigation and insurance the company may be subject to certain types of litigation  including medical malpractice claims  claim disputes pertaining to contracts and other arrangements with providers  employer groups and their employees and individual members  and disputes relating to hmo denials of coverage for certain types of medical procedures or treatments 
in addition  the company has contingent litigation risk in connection with certain discontinued operations 
such litigation may result in losses to the company 
the company maintains insurance coverage in amounts it believes to be adequate  including professional liability medical malpractice and general liability insurance 
contracting physicians are required to maintain professional liability insurance 
in addition  the company carries stop loss reinsurance to reimburse it for costs resulting from catastrophic injuries or illnesses to its members 
nonetheless  no assurance can be given as to the future availability or cost of such insurance and reinsurance or that litigation losses will not exceed the limits of the insurance coverage and reserves 
in the opinion of management and based on the facts currently known  the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company

this proposed statement would prohibit registrants from using the pooling method of accounting for business combinations 
this guidance would also continue to require recognition of purchased goodwill as an asset but would prohibit amortization of such goodwill 
goodwill would instead be tested for impairment on an ongoing basis using a fair value approach  and any adjustments thereto would result in a separate charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment took place

risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
health care costs may rise faster than our ability to increase our premium rates  causing our gross profit margin and net income to shrink 
in the future  the costs of health care services and supplies that we provide to our membership may rise faster than our ability to increase premium rates 
if costs rise and we are unable to increase premium rates  our gross profit margin will shrink 
a shrinking gross profit margin may reduce our net income and adversely affect the value of your investment in coventry 
premium rates for managed care plans generally have increased in recent months  but we could experience severely limited increases in future premium rates 
also  we derived of our premium revenues for the year ended december  from governmental programs  including medicare and medicaid 
the government generally calculates these premium rates and we cannot adjust them based on our anticipated costs 
recent legislation has limited medicare premium rate increases substantially as compared to increases permitted in prior years 
as a result  in the future the total costs of our government programs could exceed the total premiums that these programs pay to us 
if we are unable to increase our revenues and our gross profit margin shrinks  or if we are unable to maintain our revenues  our net income may decrease 
in the future  we may not be able to increase or maintain our current revenues 
increases in our revenues will generally be dependent upon our ability to increase premiums and membership 
several factors may affect our ability to maintain or increase revenues  including loss of membership to our competitors failure to attract new members inability to increase premiums due to regulatory restrictions loss of membership due to increased premium rates withdrawal from unprofitable markets consumer preferences for lower priced health care options price competition our failure to accurately estimate future health care costs may result in premiums that are insufficient to cover medical costs  which may negatively affect our operating results 
if we underestimate the costs of health care services and supplies that we provide to our members  we may set our premium rates too low 
low premiums may render us unable to generate revenues sufficient to pay future health care costs 
this shortfall could significantly change our results of operations  affect profitability and adversely affect the value of your investment in us 
while we attempt to base the premiums we charge  at least in part  on our estimate of expected health care costs over the fixed premium period  various factors may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs and could cause actual health care costs to exceed estimated health care costs 
these factors could include the increased cost of individual health care services the type and number of individual health care services delivered the occurrence of catastrophes or epidemics seasonality and trends general inflation new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs competitive pressures other unforeseen occurrences failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and loss of membership 
we expect that providers contracting with us will serve substantially all of our members by providing the required medical care 
our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets 
in addition  the terms of those provider contracts also have a material affect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
in some of our markets  there are provider systems that have a major presence 
these provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and profitability if they refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are unfavorable to us 
providers with whom we have capitation contracts may be financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their payment or medical care obligations under capitation agreements and our members may prefer to utilize other providers with whom we do not have capitation contracts 
medical cost control techniques we have utilized include capitation agreements with providers 
under these agreements  we pay providers a fixed dollar amount per member per month 
in exchange for these fixed payments  providers agree to provide all of a particular type of medical service required by our members 
under these agreements  a single integrated hospital physician provider system provides almost all hospital and medical services to a large number of members for a fixed percentage of the premium we charge for those members 
while these arrangements may shift to the contracting provider system the risk that medical costs will exceed the amounts anticipated  we will be exposed to the risks if the provider systems are financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their payment or medical care obligations under the capitation agreements 
in addition  members may prefer other providers in the market with whom we do not have capitation agreements 
if our members choose to utilize providers with whom we do not have capitation agreements  we may incur higher costs 
these higher costs may negatively affect our operating results 
significant shareholders may have the ability to exercise control over us 
as a result of our acquisition of the health plans of principal health care  inc  a subsidiary of principal life  in  principal life acquired approximately of our common stock  on a fully diluted basis 
on september   principal life sold million shares of coventry s common stock to affiliates of warburg  pincus ventures  lp warburg in a private transaction 
as a result of this sale  principal life s ownership interest was reduced to approximately of our common stock 
because of previously agreed upon limitations effective through april  principal life may purchase additional shares of our common stock up to  but not more than  ownership of our fully diluted common stock 
in addition to its ownership position  principal life currently has four designated members serving on our ten member board of directors 
as long as principal life owns at least of our outstanding common stock  it has the right to designate one member of our board of directors for each of our outstanding common stock that it holds 
on september   principal life sold million shares of our outstanding common stock to warburg in a private transaction 
as a result  principal life s ownership percentage decreased from approximately to approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  principal life s right to designate members on our board of directors has correspondingly decreased and principal life currently has the right to designate up to at least three members of our board of directors 
principal life s current ownership position and its representation on our board of directors allow it to exert significant influence over the direction and operations of coventry 
this influence could be used in a manner that is contrary to the best interests of our other shareholders and may accordingly decrease the value of your investment in coventry 
principal life has agreed that  prior to april  it will vote its shares of common stock in favor of any acquisition required to be approved by our shareholders  that a special committee of our board of directors has recommended and a majority of our shareholders  other than principal life  has approved 
the special committee will consist of members of our board of directors that are neither management nor designees of principal life 
prior to april  principal life has also agreed to vote its shares for the election of directors nominated by the nominating committee of the board of directors and not to oppose or seek removal of any person nominated by this nominating committee 
once the previously agreed upon limitations imposed on principal life expire in april  principal life could acquire additional shares of our common stock to the point that it exercises virtually complete control over the company 
when warburg purchased the million shares of our common stock from principal life in september  warburgs ownership interest increased to approximately of our fully diluted common shares 
warburg may purchase additional shares of our common stock  but warburg has agreed  effective through may  not to own more than of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
once the previously agreed upon limitations imposed on warburg expire in may  warburg could acquire additional shares of our common stock to the point that it exercises virtually complete control over the company 
in addition to its ownership position  warburg has designated two directors currently serving on our board of directors 
warburg had the right to designate at least two directors of our board of directors until such time as warburg converted its shares of our series a convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock  which occurred on december  as long as warburg retains ownership of at least of the shares of our common stock it beneficially owned at the time of its original investment in our common stock in  warburg has the right to designate at least one member on our board of directors 
as of march   warburg continues to hold all shares represented by its original investment in coventry and  therefore  currently has the right to designate one member of our board of directors 
warburg and principal life currently own approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding common shares  and could individually or together exert significant influence over the direction and operations of coventry 
the value of your investment in coventry could decline as future investors may not consider our common stock to be an attractive stock due to the percentage of our common stock held by  or that may be held by  principal life and warburg 
future and existing laws and regulations may impact our business and negatively affect our profitability 
our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and regulations governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and regulations are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth and or increase our health care and administrative costs 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services 
delay in obtaining or failing to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our covered lives  or could increase our costs 
we face periodic audits under our contracts with federal and state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business 
coventry contracts with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
these agencies include the united states office of personnel management that contracts with us to provide managed health care services for federal employees under the federal employees health benefits program  the u 
s 
health care financing administration that contracts with us to provide a medicare product to eligible beneficiaries  and states that contract with us to provide a medicaid product to eligible recipients 
these contracts and applicable federal and state regulations  among other requirements  establish premium rating requirements or fixed premiums per member per month 
these governmental agencies and states may periodically audit us to verify our compliance with their contracts and applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
these audits could result in material adjustments 
an adverse audit of our contracts with governmental agencies could result in the loss of licensure  the loss of the right to participate in programs  the imposition of fines  penalties  and other sanctions and could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
in the future  we may not be able to meet certain minimum capitalization requirements that may be adopted by states in which we do business 
the national association of insurance commissioners has proposed that states adopt risk based capital standards that  if implemented  would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
several states where we have hmo operations have adopted those standards  effective either in or to be phased in over a period of years 
while we do not expect the legislation enacted to date to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position in the near future  we cannot assure that additional legislation of this type will not unduly burden our financial resources 
costs associated with litigation may result in losses to us that could negatively affect us 
we are susceptible to litigation and insurance risks  including medical malpractice liability  disputes relating to the denial of coverage and the adequacy of stop loss reinsurance for costs resulting from catastrophic injuries or illnesses 
we also face contingent litigation risk from discontinued operations 
these litigation and insurance risks may result in losses to us that could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial performance  cash flows or future prospects
