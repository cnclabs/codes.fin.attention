page results of operations revenues revenues for fiscal were  million  an increase of million or compared to revenues for fiscal  and an increase of million or compared to revenues for fiscal cypress derives its revenues from the sale of memory products and non memory products  which are primarily targeted to the data communications and computation markets 
year ended increase december  january  january  to to in thousands memory products    non memory products    total revenues    revenues from the sale of memory products for fiscal increased million or over revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal and increased million  or compared to fiscal the increase in memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted from both higher average selling prices asps and an increase in unit sales 
asps grew from fiscal to fiscal and unit saes increased over the same period 
when comparing fiscal to fiscal  unit sales volume of memory products increased  and asps increased 
the increase in unit sales in fiscal can be attributed primarily to new product revenues  particularly in the meg synchronous family  which includes the no bus latency nobl static random access memories ram s  the and meg more battery life mobl and the meg micro power family of products 
the synchronous demand was driven by the surge in the networking market  while sales for mobl and other micro power devices were driven by growth in the cellular phone market 
high asps are a result of strong demand for static rams and the continuing increase in the average density mbits unit of static ram products sold 
revenues in from the sale of non memory products increased million or from and grew million or from the growth was predominantly unit related and can be attributed to the market acceptance of cypress physical layer phy  data communication  clock and usb products 
key products in the portfolio include our hotlink optical transceivers  the roboclock family of clock buffers  our low skew and low jitter programmable clocks  our broad portfolio of specialty multi port memories and our plug and play usb devices 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  asps of products generally decline over the lifetime of the products 
to increase revenues  cypress seeks to expand its market share in the markets it currently serves and to introduce and sell new products with higher asps 
cypress will seek to remain competitive with respect to its pricing to prevent a further decline in sales 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal were of revenues  compared to of revenues for fiscal and of revenues for fiscal the decrease in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was primarily due to a significant increase in unit sales  resulting in a lower fixed cost per unit sold and to the introduction of new products with higher margins 
cost of revenues for fiscal included one time non recurring charges totaling million 
these charges included million related to the write down of inventory  million for the write off of pre operating costs and million for the write off of certain equipment 
the million charge for incremental inventory reserves arose due to market conditions resulting in the ongoing  over supply and continued inventory corrections by end user customers 
the write off of pre operating costs included million related to cypress s wafer fabrication operation in bloomington  minnesota and million related to its assembly and test operations in the philippines 
as a result of the restructuring activities  cypress wrote off its previously capitalized pre operating costs as an impaired asset due to uncertainties surrounding their future economic benefits 
page the write off of equipment was related to equipment identified as obsolete during cypress s periodic review of equipment and no longer considered usable

this conversion has helped speed the pace of advanced technology transfers to production 
selling  general and administrative year ended increase december  january  january  to to in thousands revenues    selling  general and administrative    sg a as percent of revenues selling  general and administrative sg a spending increases from fiscal to fiscal have been driven primarily by increased selling and marketing expenses

legal and professional costs related to patent infringement litigation including the successful defense of the emi lawsuit in  patent filing and our tax rate optimization program have contributed to increases in administrative costs over the three year period

sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cypress is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  cypress utilizes derivative financial instruments 
cypress does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of cypress s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of cypress s investment portfolio 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of cypress s debt obligation 
a majority of cypress s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  cypress does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and certain other european currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  cypress has established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
cypress s hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency rate movements 
based on cypress s overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar would have an immaterial effect on cypress s financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on cypress s balances as of december  page
