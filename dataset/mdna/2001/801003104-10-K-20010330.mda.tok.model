item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
in particular  we have included forward looking statements regarding the following i our strategy  ii the anticipated timing of our regulatory filings and approvals  iii other product development efforts that we intend to undertake  including expanded uses and indications for existing products  and the related capital outlays  iv the growth of our product sales and markets  v the results of our litigation  vi our future revenue and expenses  and vii the anticipated timing of the sale of our division known as the transplant pharmacy 
sangstat is a global biotechnology company building on its foundation in transplantation to discover  develop and market high value therapeutic products in the transplantation  immunology and hematology oncology areas 
since  we have been dedicated to improving the outcome of organ and bone marrow transplantation through the development and marketing of products to address all phases of transplantation in the worldwide market 
our us headquarters are in fremont  california 
we also maintain a strong european presence  including direct sales and marketing forces in all major european markets and distributors throughout the rest of the world 
our business is currently organized into two segments pharmaceutical products and transplantation services 
the pharmaceutical products segment consists of five marketed products  three principal product candidates and additional product candidates in various stages of research and development 
we plan to capitalize on our products and product pipeline by developing relationships with key providers and managed care organizations to better integrate the management of transplant recipients care to improve the outcomes and lower the costs of transplants 
the transplantation services segment consists of the transplant pharmacy ttp 
in october  we announced that we hoped to sell ttp 
in early march  we received several non binding offers to purchase ttp  one of which we accepted on march   thus committing to a formal plan to sell this segment 
we are currently in advanced negotiations with this bidder and expect to complete the sale of ttp by april  consequently  the historical consolidated statements of operations and cash flows have been restated for all periods presented to account for ttp as a discontinued operation 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
our accumulated deficit from inception through december  was  our operating loss has been substantial each year since inception and losses are expected to continue in the foreseeable future as a result of a number of factors  including the uncertainty in the timing and the amount of revenue to be earned upon product sales  and expenses required for product development  clinical trials and marketing and sales activities 
in addition  our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the success of our research and development efforts  litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  obtaining and enforcing patents important to our business  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process  reliance on third parties to manufacture products or product candidates  competition from other products and uncertainties associated with health care reform measures 
even if our products appear promising at various stages of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the product candidates will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  be uneconomical to market  be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties or be unacceptable to providers  payers or patients 
additional expenses  delays and losses of opportunities that may arise out of these and other risks could harm our business and results of operations 
acquisition of imtix on september   we completed the acquisition of pasteur m rieux connaught s aventis organ transplant business known as imtix 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the resulting wholly owned subsidiary  named imtix sangstat imtix  is dedicated to the research  development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals for transplantation 
the aggregate gross purchase price of approximately million consisted of million paid upon closing and a non interest bearing note of million payable over five years see liquidity and capital resources 
the resulting aggregate net purchase price totaled million and was allocated to the net tangible assets acquired of million  based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  identifiable intangible assets of million and purchased in process research and development of million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to existing technology  and is being amortized over a period of fourteen years 
the purchased in process research and development of approximately million was charged to our operations in the third quarter of and represents the value of products that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the purchased in process technology acquired primarily consisted of a single drug  anti lfa anti lfa is a monoclonal  biologically manufactured immunosuppressant compound intended to be used in preventing the rejection of organ transplants 
the estimated value for the in process technology was determined using the income approach which discounted to present value the cash flows expected to be derived from the product as it was still in development at the date of acquisition 
the projections were based on future expectations of the acquired company s revenue and expenses to be generated from the product still under development 
revenues and operating profit attributable to the in process technology were estimated to total million and million  respectively  over a fourteen year projection period 
the resulting projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value of million using a discount rate of  adjusted on a prorata basis for negative goodwill 
the discount rate used was calculated based on the weighted average cost of capital and adjusted for the technology risk associated with development of the in process product 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product principally related to the completion of clinical trials to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population 
upon successful completion of the trials  fda approval would be required before marketing the product for a specified use 
during  following our evaluation of the outcome of the ongoing clinical studies  we decided to discontinue the development of anti lfa the consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of imtix from october  accordingly  the results of operations for and include a full year of imtix s results versus three months in results of operations revenues 
net sales of pharmaceutical products for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over net sales of  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to sales of gengraf  which was launched in the us in may  and increased sales of thymoglobulin in the us  which accounted for  and  of the increase  respectively 
this increase was partially offset by lower sales outside the us 
in particular  sales in europe for the year ended december  were adversely affected by weakening currencies 
had average exchange rates remained the same as in fiscal  net sales in fiscal would have been higher by million 
on june  we  in discussions with the fda that began on june   concluded that a recall of sangcya oral solution from the us market would be required 
following further discussions with the fda as to the type of recall and mechanism for conducting it  we announced this decision on july  as a result  net sales for the year ended december  have been reduced by  for returns of sangcya oral solution from customers following the product recall 
net sales of pharmaceutical products for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over net sales of  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to sales of thymoglobulin in the us following the launch of that product in february in addition  net product sales in fiscal included a full year of sales of therapeutic products in europe as a result of the acquisition of imtix  compared with only one quarter of sales in fiscal included in net sales of pharmaceutical products was revenue from collaborative agreements of  in  an increase of  or over revenue from collaborative agreements of  in revenue from such agreements in fiscal represented an increase of  or over revenue of  for the year ended december  in and  we recognized revenue of  and  from milestone payments from abbott laboratories under the co promotion agreement for cyclosporine 
the unamortized portion of these milestone payments is shown as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the co promotion agreement 
we also recognized revenue from milestone payments of  and  in and respectively from amgen under the collaborative distribution agreement for our cyclosporine products in certain territories outside the us 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for pharmaceutical products were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or over cost of sales of  for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  was primarily due to the establishment of inventory reserves resulting from the us recall of sangcya oral solution 
these product recall charges  which totaled  included a percent reserve for all sangcya oral solution and cyclotech finished goods and components  as well as a partial reserve against our bulk cyclosporine inventories that we do not expect to use prior to lot expiration 
the remainder of the increase in cost of sales for the year ended december  was due to the overall increase in sales and the higher cost of gengraf compared to our other products 
cost of sales for pharmaceutical products of  for the year ended december  represented an increase of  or over cost of sales of  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increased sales of pharmaceutical products 
cost of sales in fiscal also included provisions of  for short dated sangcya oral solution finished goods inventory 
research and development 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or over research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase in spending on research and development for the year ended december  mainly relates to charges for a license fee and reimbursement of development costs for abx cbl totaling million  clinical trials to pursue label expansion of thymoglobulin and continued pre clinical work on rdp  a product in development that inhibits synthesis of tnf alpha 
the expenses for the year ended december  also included  to cover the cost of terminating sangcya oral solution clinical trials following the previously discussed product recall 
research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  represented a decrease of  or over research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in spending on clinical trials for thymoglobulin and sangcya oral solution 
thymoglobulin was approved by the us food and drug administration fda on december  and was launched in the us in february following its approval in the us by the fda on october   sangcya oral solution was approved by the medicines control agency in the united kingdom in february and was launched in that country in april selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the expenses of  associated with the launch of gengraf 
expenses for the year ended december  also included  to cover the cost of managing the product recall of sangcya oral solution and terminating ongoing marketing programs 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by an overall reduction in spending resulting from the cost containment measures announced in october selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  represented an increase of  or over selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses in fiscal reflects the inclusion of imtix expenses for the whole year and an increase in expenses incurred in the us 
this increase was due primarily to sales and marketing expenses for thymoglobulin and sangcya oral solution  as well as legal expenses relating to the novartis lawsuits 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of imtix  we recorded a charge of  for purchased in process research and development in this charge was primarily associated with the ongoing development of anti lfa during  following our evaluation of the outcome of the ongoing clinical studies  we decided to discontinue the development of anti lfa amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense for the imtix acquisition related intangible assets was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  over amortization expense of  for the year ended december  amortization expense for the year ended december  was  since this expense occurred only in the fourth quarter of interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  for both fiscal and  the change in interest income versus the prior year primarily reflected the change in the average cash balance available for investment

for the year ended december   we recorded a similar provision of  based on income earned by our european affiliates for the fourth quarter of fiscal net loss from continuing operations 
net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in net loss for fiscal was due primarily to the product recall returns and charges of  and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by the increase in net sales net of related cost of sales 
net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was due primarily to the increase in net sales net of related cost of sales  partially offset by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses

net sales of transplantation services for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over sales of  for the year ended december  net sales of transplantation services in fiscal represented an increase of  or over sales of  for the year ended december  the increase in net sales in both fiscal and was due primarily to an increase in the number of patients serviced by the transplant pharmacy 
net sales for all periods consisted entirely of drug sales to transplant patients 
net loss for transplantation services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was due primarily to the increase in operating expenses  partially offset by an increase in sales of the transplant pharmacy 
net loss for transplantation services for the year ended december was  a decrease of  or compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was due primarily to the increase in sales of the transplant pharmacy 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we financed our operations substantially from proceeds of approximately  from public offerings of our common stock   from private placements of equity securities and  from the convertible note and the note payable to abbott laboratories 
during the years ended december   and  our net cash used in continuing operating activities was approximately   and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was substantially due to a reduction in net inventories and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase in net loss 
the reduction in inventories is primarily due to provisions of  relating to the sangcya oral solution product recall  which resulted in a corresponding increase in net loss for the year net cash used in also included an increase in other current assets reflecting  cash used as collateral for the note payable to finova 
in fiscal years and  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the amount of net loss incurred  as well as an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable over the prior year 
in fiscal year these uses of cash were partially offset by the receipt of  in milestone payments from abbott laboratories in connection with our co promotion agreement with abbott 
the cash used in the discontinued operation approximated the net loss of the discontinued operation for the years ended december   and as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and total assets of  net cash provided by investing activities totaled   and  during the years ended december   and respectively

on august   we entered into a global co development  supply and license agreement with abgenix  inc for abx cbl  an antibody developed by abgenix 
we will have an exclusive worldwide license for the marketing and sale of abx cbl  an anti cd monoclonal antibody for the treatment of steroid resistant graft versus host disease gvhd 
abx cbl is currently in a multicenter  randomized  and controlled phase ii iii study 
we made an initial license fee payment of million and an additional payment to abgenix of million as partial reimbursement of one half of the development costs incurred by abgenix between january  and august  we will pay a further million as reimbursement of these development costs in two equal installments at the end of june and development costs incurred after august  will be shared equally  as would any potential profits from future sales of collaboration products 
we share responsibility for product development  including the ongoing clinical trial 
abgenix will be responsible for manufacturing abx cbl 
we also have the right  subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  to commercialize other anti cd antibodies developed by abgenix 
on april  we signed an agreement with finova to provide a line of credit of up to million the loan agreement 
the loan agreement has a three year term and may be renewed annually thereafter if both parties agree 
the line of credit consists of two elements a million line of credit bearing interest at the prime rate at december  and secured by a matching compensating cash balance  and a million line of credit bearing interest at the prime rate plus and based on eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory  as defined in the loan agreement 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we are required to maintain a loan balance of at least million 
as collateral for the line of credit  we have granted finova a first priority security interest in certain of its tangible and intangible assets and have pledged the stock of our two french subsidiaries  imtix sangstat sas and sangstat atlantique sa 
in addition  we are required to meet certain financial covenants 
at december  we had drawn down million under the line of credit and had set aside a corresponding compensating balance  which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have not drawn down any additional amounts under this line of credit and have no plans to do so 
in connection with this financing  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
this warrant has been valued using the black scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions expected life  five years  stock volatility   risk free interest rate   and no dividend payments during the expected term 
the calculated value of the warrant of  and the additional financing fees of  have been included in other assets and are being amortized over the three year life of the loan agreement 
as of december   we were in default of the tangible net worth covenant under the loan agreement as a result of the reserve we took against inventory due to the sangcya oral solution recall 
the loan agreement does not provide for a cure period for such a default 
finova has requested that the parties amend the loan agreement to terminate it as of september  and eliminate the portion of the line of credit collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory from the date of the amendment until termination of the loan agreement 
in exchange  finova would waive the default and all early termination penalties with respect to the loan agreement 
we are currently in negotiations with finova regarding this proposed amendment 
in march  we issued a million convertible note due march  this note bears interest at the rate of through march  and thereafter at the rate of on any overdue amount 
the interest is payable semi annually in september and march 
the note  or any portion thereof  is convertible at the option of the holder at any time on or after march  and before march  into shares of our common stock at the rate of shares of common stock for each  principal amount 
we received net proceeds of  in may  we received a loan of million from abbott laboratories 
the loan bears interest at  payable annually 
the loan matures on december   and can be pre paid without penalty at any time prior to maturity 
notes payable include  and  at december  and  respectively  representing the current accreted value of the non interest bearing note issued in connection with the acquisition of imtix 
the note was discounted at a rate of and the remaining unpaid balance of million at december  is payable as follows million in  million in  and million in in february  we completed a private placement of approximately  shares of common stock with an institutional investor 
the stock was issued at  the closing price of the stock on february   for aggregate proceeds of  on january   we completed a private placement of approximately million shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately million with a group of institutional investors 
shares were purchased at a discount to the closing market price on the date the agreements were signed 
the transaction occurred in two tranches of approximately million  shares and million  shares respectively  the first of which closed december   the second of which closed january  we did not pay any investment banking fees and did not issue any warrants with respect to this placement 
we intend to use the proceeds to provide additional working capital to fund our anticipated future growth 
in fiscal years  and we purchased   and  respectively  of new property and equipment 
in fiscal years and this spending consisted primarily of manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements for our new corporate headquarters in fremont  california and expenditures associated with the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning erp system 
in fiscal year spending consisted primarily of manufacturing and other equipment 
at december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately   and  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
in addition  we had available research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately  and  for federal and state tax purposes 
our ability to realize the benefits of the nol and credit carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in the respective taxing jurisdictions prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to avail ourselves of such benefits 
furthermore  utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
we believe that we have sufficient cash to finance our current operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through additional financings  including private or public equity and or debt offerings and collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners in order to pursue new business opportunities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the status of competitive products  the maintenance of our manufacturing facility and the establishment of third party manufacturing arrangements  the establishment and maintenance of sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties  and the costs of manufacturing scale up and working capital requirements for inventory and financing of accounts receivable 
euro currency the single european currency euro was introduced on january  with complete transition to this new currency required by january we have made and expect to continue to make changes to our internal systems in preparation for the transition to the euro 
changes made to date include changing the operating currency of our two french subsidiaries from the french franc to the euro  which became effective during the second quarter of we expect to convert the other european subsidiaries that are affected by the euro within the next twelve months 
we further expect that use of the euro may affect our foreign exchange activities and may result in increased fluctuations in foreign currency results 
any delays in our ability to be euro compliant could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
we adopted sfas effective january  we have completed our evaluation of the impact that will result from adopting sfas as amended and interpreted and have concluded that adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
 as amended  was effective for us in the fourth quarter of and clarified the sec s views on us gaap for revenue recognition in financial statements 
the requirements of sab no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
replaces sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
it revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
we have adopted the applicable disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in our consolidated financial statements as of december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the remaining provisions of sfas no 
 which will be effective for transactions entered into after march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity security prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of government and corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount  which is consistent with the estimated effects at december  we generally have the ability to hold fixed income investments until maturity and therefore do not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
substantially all of our long term obligations bear interest at fixed rates which are not subject to future increases in interest rates 
the fair value of these long term obligations  including current portion  at december  was million compared to book value of million see note to consolidated financial statements 
the corresponding fair value at december  was million compared to book value of million 
we therefore do not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
if our notes payable and convertible debt were subject to rate fluctuation  a hypothetical interest rate increase of would have added approximately  to our interest expense for and  for equity price risk 
following the sale of our portfolio of corporate equity securities in december and january for a net gain of  we no longer hold any such securities 
foreign currency risk 
many of our foreign sales are invoiced in local currencies  creating receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro and the japanese yen 
the risk due to foreign currency fluctuations associated with these receivables is partially reduced by local payables denominated in the same currencies  and presently we do not consider it necessary to hedge these exposures 
we intend to re assess our hedging policy from time to time as our foreign operations change 
a movement in the currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial position or the results of operations 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december  and actual results may differ materially
