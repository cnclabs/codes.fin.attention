table of contents previously described as having been incurred in connection with the keystone merger 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  included in the determination of goodwill were charges totaling million  net of applicable income taxes  for severance of former chase and fnb employees  legal and other professional fees  and termination of contracts for data processing and other services

despite the impact of the securitization of approximately billion of residential mortgage loans during the second quarter of  average loans and leases rose to billion in  an increase of billion or from billion in excluding the impact of the securitization  average loans and leases grew approximately billion in  approximately half of which was due to new originations  net of repayments 
the remaining increase was largely the result of the billion of loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of keystone on october  a increase in average loans outstanding in was the most significant factor contributing to the rise in that year s net interest income from million in average loans and leases and average earning assets in were billion and billion  respectively 
net interest margin  or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  has remained stable throughout the past three years  measuring in and  and in reflecting favorable credit loss experience  the provision for credit losses decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs totaled million in  significantly lower than million in and million in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases 
table of contents outstanding declined to 
in from 
in and 
in noninterest income grew by to million in from million in contributing to the higher noninterest income were increases in service charges on deposit accounts  income from leasing activities  and brokerage services income  partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues and losses from sales of bank investment securities 
approximately of the increase in noninterest income from to was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the keystone acquisition 
in january  m t contributed appreciated investment securities with a fair value of million to an affiliated  tax exempt private charitable foundation 
as a result of the contribution  in the company recognized charitable contributions expense of million and recognized tax exempt other income of million 
the contribution provided an income tax benefit of approximately million and  accordingly  resulted in an after tax increase in s net income of thousand  or 
per diluted share 
excluding the effect of this contribution  noninterest income in increased from million in growth in mortgage banking revenues and fees earned from deposit services  as well as a full year of revenues associated with operations obtained in the onbancorp acquisition  were factors that contributed to the increase from to noninterest expenses associated with operations  which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and certain nonrecurring expenses  were million in  an increase of from million in the excluded items consist of nonrecurring merger related expenses of million and million in and  respectively  and amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of million in and million in higher salaries and employee benefits expenses  including merit salary increases  incentive based compensation arrangements  and increased staffing levels as a result of acquisitions in and  contributed to the increase in noninterest operating expenses 
after excluding million of nonrecurring merger related expenses  million of amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible  and million of expense related to the contribution to the affiliated charitable foundation  noninterest expenses associated with operations totaled million in higher expenses related to salaries  employee benefits and occupancy contributed to the higher expense level in compared with the efficiency ratio  or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  measures how much of a company s revenue is consumed by operating expenses 
reflecting the smooth integration of the acquisitions into m t  the efficiency ratio  calculated using the adjusted income and expense totals noted above and excluding gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income  was in  compared with in and in cash operating results unlike many other banking companies  m t has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the company had recorded intangible assets consisting predominately of goodwill and core deposit intangible totaling billion  million and million at december   and  respectively 
included in such intangible assets at december   and was goodwill of billion  million and million  respectively 
since the amortization of these acquired intangible assets does not result in a cash expense  m t believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results on 
table of contents a cash  or tangible basis which excludes the after tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and the related asset balances represents a relevant measure of financial performance 
the supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of other non cash operating expenses such as depreciation  provision for credit losses  or deferred income taxes associated with the results of operations 
unless noted otherwise  cash basis data does  however  exclude the after tax impact of nonrecurring merger related expenses associated with acquisitions 
cash net income grew to million in  an improvement of from million in diluted and basic cash earnings per share in both increased by to and  respectively  from and in in  cash net income was million  while diluted and basic cash earnings per share were and  respectively

net interest income lending and funding activities net interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis rose to million in from million in  largely the result of growth in average earning assets  which increased billion or to billion in from billion in taxable equivalent net interest income and average earning assets in were million and billion  respectively 
the growth in average earning assets in and was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding  which totaled billion in  up from billion in and higher than billion in growth in average loans and leases resulting from origination and acquisition activities was partially offset in by the impact of the securitization of approximately billion of residential mortgage loans during the second quarter 
the resulting mortgage backed securities  which are fully guaranteed by the federal national mortgage association  are included in the company s portfolio of available for sale investment securities 
excluding the impact of the securitization  average loans and leases grew by approximately billion  or  from to approximately half of such growth was attributable to new originations  net of the impact of repayments 
the remaining increase was largely the result of the billion of loans obtained in the october  acquisition of keystone 
those acquired loans included approximately billion of commercial loans  billion of commercial real estate loans  billion of residential mortgage loans and billion of consumer loans and leases 
in addition to net origination activities  the impact of the million of loans obtained in june from the fnb transaction and the full year impact of the billion of loans acquired in the april onbancorp transaction contributed to the higher average loan balances in compared with the accompanying table summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years

for borrowers in good standing  the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest 
in response to customer needs  in recent years the company has also originated fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years 
in general  these loans have original maturity terms of approximately ten years 
the company also originates adjustable rate commercial real estate loans 
as of december   approximately of the commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate loans 
the accompanying table presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area  type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at december  of the billion of commercial real estate loans in the new york city metropolitan area  approximately were secured by multi family residential properties  by retail space and by office space 
the company s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multi family residential properties 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of new york city area loans were for million or less  while loans of more than million made up approximately of the total

the company has also invested in debt securities issued by municipalities and debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions 
when purchasing investment securities  the company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to prepayment and other risks assumed 
in managing its investment securities portfolio  the company occasionally sells investment securities following completion of a business combination  such as the recent acquisition of keystone  and as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads  actual or anticipated prepayments  or credit risk associated with a particular security 
investment securities obtained in the keystone transaction totaled approximately billion on october  through december   approximately million of such securities were sold 
the size of the investment securities portfolio is influenced by such factors as demand for loans  which generally yield more than investment securities  ongoing repayments  the level of deposits  and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios

domestic time deposits over  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  averaged billion in  compared with billion in and billion in offshore branch deposits  comprised primarily of accounts with balances of  or more  averaged million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
brokered deposits averaged million in  compared with billion in and billion in  and totaled million at december  brokered deposits have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings to lengthen the average maturity of interest bearing liabilities 
the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits at december  was years 
certain of the brokered deposits have provisions that allow early redemption 
in connection with the company s management of interest rate risk  interest rate swaps have been entered into under which the company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms similar to the amounts and terms of many of the brokered deposits 
additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time 
the company also uses borrowings from banks  securities dealers  the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh together  the fhlb  and others as sources of funding

as previously noted  m t bank issued million of subordinated capital notes on october  in anticipation of the keystone and premier acquisitions 
changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as described herein  as well as changes in interest rates and spreads  can impact net interest income 
net interest spread  or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in  compared with in as a result of generally rising interest rates during much of  the yield on earning assets increased basis points hundredths of one 
table of contents percent to from in however  the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased even further  rising basis points to from in actions taken by the federal reserve in and contributed to the rising level of interest rates in in  the net interest spread was  the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 
net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  partially offset by goodwill and core deposit intangible  bank owned life insurance and other non earning assets 
net interest free funds contributed 
to net interest margin in  compared with 
in and 
in average net interest free funds totaled billion in  billion in and billion in the increase in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in as compared with resulted from the impact of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution and a million increase in the average balance of net interest free funds  largely comprised of higher average balances in noninterest bearing deposits and retained earnings 
the decline from to in the contribution to net interest margin of net interest free funds was due  in part  to the goodwill and core deposit intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the fnb  chase branch and onbancorp acquisitions and the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
goodwill and core deposit intangible assets averaged million in  million in and million in  while the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged million in  million in and million in increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income  but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations 
future changes in market interest rates or spreads  as well as changes in the composition of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under a number of different interest rate scenarios 
as part of the management of interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
revenue and expense arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields earned on assets or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was approximately million 
in general  under the terms of these swaps  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at variable rates 
in anticipation of the previously noted issuance of million of fixed rate subordinated notes in october  the company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements during september  including forward starting swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million 
under the terms of the terminated swaps  the company would have made fixed rate payments and received variable rate payments 
the termination of these swaps  which had been entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed rate commercial real estate loans  resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately million which will be recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the swaps 
the impact of the termination of the swaps on the company s results of operations in was not significant 
the average notional amounts of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes  the related effect on net interest income and margin  and the weighted average rate paid or received on those swaps are presented in the accompanying table 
table of contents the company estimates that as of december  it would have received approximately million if all interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes had been terminated  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap portfolio results from the effects of changing interest rates 
additional information about interest rate swaps is included in note of notes to financial statements 
through december   changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes were not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting for interest rate swaps and other derivative financial instruments that became effective january  is presented herein under the heading recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 
provision for credit losses a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the company s allowance for credit losses to a level that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the provision for credit losses was million in  down from million in and million in net loan charge offs in were million  significantly lower than million in and million in net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreased to 
in from 
in and 
in nonperforming loans  consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans  totaled million or 
of loans and leases outstanding at december   compared with million or 
a year earlier and million or 
at december  the increase at december  as compared with and reflects the inclusion of approximately million of nonperforming loans acquired in the merger with keystone on october  accruing loans past due days or more totaled million or 
of total loans and leases at december   compared with million or 
at december  and million or 
at december  the increase resulted largely from the inclusion at december  of million of one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the company and repurchased during the fourth quarter of from the government national mortgage association gnma 
the outstanding principal balances of such loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies 
the loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with the loans  including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments to gnma that had not been received from individual mortgagors 
expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of associated with the repurchased loans were approximately million and have been included in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income 
the allowance for credit losses was million or of net loans and leases at the end of  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year end  and was  and  respectively 
the decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at december  as compared with prior years reflects management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each date  the relatively favorable and or stable economic environment for many commercial borrowers during much of the recent year  the july sale of the company s retail credit card business  and other factors 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any 
table of contents collateral 
significant loans are individually analyzed  while other smaller balance loans are evaluated by loan category 
management cautiously evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for credit losses as of december  in addition to the impact of acquisitions  factors considered by management when performing such assessment included  but were not limited to i the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the company s loan portfolio  particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state  in general  and in the new york city metropolitan area  in particular  ii the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area that have not experienced the same degree of economic growth experienced by the vast majority of other regions of the country in recent years  and iii significant growth in loans to individual consumers 
based upon the results of such review  management believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date 
the accompanying table presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based upon management s classification of loans under the company s internal loan grading system and assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by the company s internal loan review department and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from i comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the company that have not experienced the same degree of economic growth evident in much of the rest of the country in recent years  ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type  collateral type and geographic location  in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area and other areas of new york state  iii the effect of expansion into new markets  including market areas entered through acquisitions  iv the introduction of new loan product types  including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years  and  v the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance 
led by growth in new york city  the economy in new york state expanded during at a rate similar to that of the national average 
however  although improved when compared to prior years  economic growth in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area continued to lag behind the rest of the country 
furthermore  consistent with other regions of the country  the rate of employment growth in new york state slowed during the second half of slower job growth  coupled with a declining population base  has left the upstate new york region susceptible to potential credit problems  particularly related to commercial customers 
after contracting throughout and  the economy in central pennsylvania stabilized in nevertheless  the rate of employment growth in central pennsylvania in was approximately one half the rate experienced in the rest of the country 
given the company s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in new york state  including the upstate new york region  and central pennsylvania  and considering the other factors already discussed  the level of the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was deemed prudent and reasonable by management 
nevertheless  the allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category 
accordingly  the amounts presented in the table are not necessarily indicative of future losses within the individual loan categories 
several factors influence the company s credit loss experience  
table of contents including overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective 
commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate  economic conditions and interest rates  and  in many cases  the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property

liquidity refers to the company s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals  to fund operating costs  and to be used for other corporate purposes 
liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the company 
core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with and at december  and  respectively 
the company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings  including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  brokered certificates of deposit  and borrowings from the fhlb and others 
m t bank 
table of contents had short term and long term credit facilities with the fhlb aggregating billion at december  outstanding borrowings under the fhlb credit facilities totaled billion at december  and billion at december  such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities 
m t bank and m t bank  na had available lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york at december  totaling approximately billion 
the amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at either december  or as previously noted  m t bank issued million of fixed rate subordinated capital notes in october that provided liquidity and facilitated the acquisitions of keystone and premier 
although informal and sometimes reciprocal  sources of funding are available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
m t s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses  stockholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
these historic sources of cash flow were augmented in by the proceeds from issuance of million of trust preferred securities  which provided a substantial portion of m t s funding needs during and additional information regarding the trust preferred securities is included in note of notes to financial statements 
m t also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  of which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  outstanding borrowings under a similar million line of credit that expired during totaled million at december  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business 
management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either m t or its subsidiary banks 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the company s financial instruments 
the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the company to interest rate risk  which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
as a result  net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future years under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income 
the balances of both on and off balance sheet financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the company s financial instruments 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was approximately million 
information about interest rate swaps entered into for 
table of contents interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
the company s asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken action  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or entering into additional interest rate swap agreements 
the accompanying table as of december  and displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from changes in interest rates during the first modeling year 
many assumptions were utilized by the company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the company s net interest income 
the more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets  cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the company also assumed gradual changes in rates of and basis points up and down during a twelve month period 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter such changes 
in accordance with industry practice  the accompanying table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes 
management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities 
trading activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities  us treasury and other government securities  mortgage backed securities and interest rate contracts  such as swaps 
the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions 
the amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the asset liability committee 

table of contents the notional amounts of interest rate and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet

the obligations to return such collateral were recorded as noninterest bearing trading account liabilities and were included in accrued interest and other liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of such collateral and the related obligation to return collateral was million at december  given the company s policies  limits and positions  management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material as of december  and additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note of notes to financial statements
