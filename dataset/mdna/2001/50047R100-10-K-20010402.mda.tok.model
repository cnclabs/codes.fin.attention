following the reincorporation on december   the company reorganized as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust an upreit 
the company then contributed to kpt properties  lp formerly fac properties  lp  a delaware limited partnership the operating partnership  all of its assets and liabilities 
in exchange for the company s assets  the company received limited partnership interests op units in the operating partnership in an amount and designation that corresponded to the number and designation of outstanding shares of capital stock of the company at the time 
the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and owned a interest as of december  as additional limited partners are admitted to the operating partnership in exchange for the contribution of properties  the company s percentage ownership in the operating partnership will decline 
as the company issues additional shares of capital stock  it will contribute the proceeds for that capital stock to the operating partnership in exchange for a number of op units equal to the number of shares that the company issues 
the company conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets through the operating partnership either directly or through subsidiaries such that an op unit is economically equivalent to a share of the company s common stock

effectively  this allows the company to use units instead of stock to acquire properties  which provides an advantage over non upreit entities

economic conditions inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years with certain segments of the economy experiencing disinflation  such as apparel sales 
disinflation in this market segment has slowed the growth of tenant sales  which adversely affects the company s revenue due to lower percentage and overage rents on some properties 
any weakness in the overall retail environment as it relates to tenant sales volumes may have an impact on the company s ability to renew leases at current rental rates or to re lease space to other tenants 
a decline in sales can effect renewal of tenant leases as well as the viability of the tenant  which could result in reduced revenue 
percentage and overage rent are directly impacted by sales volumes and represented of the company s total revenue for the years ended december  and continuation of this trend may affect the company s operating centers occupancy rate  rental rates  and concessions  if any  granted on new leases or re leases of space 
this in turn may cause fluctuations in the cash flow from the operation and performance of the operating centers
