item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial services company which invests in a portfolio of securities and investments backed principally by single family mortgage loans  commercial mortgage loans and manufactured housing installment loans 
such loans have been funded generally by the company s loan production operations or purchased in bulk in the market 
loans funded through the company s production operations have generally been pooled and pledged as collateral using a collateralized bond security structure  which provides long term financing for the loans while limiting credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
financial condition december  amounts in thousands except per share data investments collateral for collateralized bonds   securities   other investments   loans held for sale or securitization   non recourse debt   recourse debt   shareholders equity   book value per common share collateral for collateralized bonds collateral for collateralized bonds consists primarily of securities backed by adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage loans secured by first liens on single family properties  fixed rate loans secured by first liens on multifamily and commercial properties  manufactured housing installment loans secured by either a ucc filing or a motor vehicle title and delinquent property tax receivables 
as of december   the company had series of collateralized bonds outstanding 
collateral for collateralized bonds are considered available for sale  and are therefore carried at estimated fair value 
the collateral for collateralized bonds decreased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  this decrease of billion is primarily the result of paydowns on collateral and in an increase in the unrealized loss 
securities securities at december  consist primarily of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
securities also include derivative and residual securities 
securities at december  include the aforementioned securities as well as fixed rate funding notes and securities secured by automobile installment contracts 
derivative securities are classes of collateralized bonds  mortgage pass through certificates or mortgage certificates that pay to the holder substantially all interest ie  an interest only security  or substantially all principal ie  a principal only security 
residual interests represent the right to receive the excess of i the cash flow from the collateral pledged to secure related mortgage backed securities  together with any reinvestment income thereon  over ii the amount required for principal and interest payments on the mortgage backed securities or repurchase arrangements  together with any related administrative expenses 
securities decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  primarily as a result of the sale of such securities  which were sold in order to repay recourse debt 
other investments other investments consist primarily of delinquent property tax receivables and a note receivable received in connection with the sale of the company s single family mortgage operations in may other investments decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease of million was primarily the result of paydown on the note receivable of million  partially offset by the purchase of additional delinquent property tax receivables of million in loans held for sale loans held for sale or securitization decreased from million at december  to million at december  principally due to sales in the proceeds from the sales of loans were used to repay associated recourse debt outstanding 
non recourse debt collateralized bonds issued by the company are recourse only to the assets pledged as collateral  and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
collateralized bonds decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease was primarily a result of principal paydowns made during the year  from the principal payments received from the associated collateral for collateralized bonds 
recourse debt recourse debt decreased from million at december  to million at december  at december   the company was in violation of certain covenants on a substantial portion of its recourse debt  and during  the company focused its efforts on the repayment of such debt  primarily from sales of associated assets pledged to secure such recourse debt

in addition  during the company reduced its obligations under letters of credit and conditional bond repurchase agreements by million 
shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was a combined result of a million increase in the net unrealized loss on investments available for sale from million at december  to million at december   and a net loss of million during the year 
results of operations for the year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share information net interest margin before provision for losses    provision for losses    net interest margin    net loss on sales  write downs and impairment charges related to commercial production operations   related to sales of investments and trading activities    related to autobond and autobond securities    related to sale of loan production operations  other equity in losses earnings of dhi   general and administrative expenses    net administrative fees and expenses to dhi   net income loss before preferred stock dividends    basic net income loss per common share diluted net income loss per common share dividends declared per share common series a and b preferred series c preferred adjusted for both the two for one common stock split effective may  and the one for four reverse common stock split effective august  compared to the decrease in net income and net income per common share during as compared to is primarily the result of a decrease in net interest margin  which is partially offset by a a decrease in net loss on sales  b impairment charges and write downs  and c decreases in general and administrative expenses and net administrative fees and expenses to dhi 
net interest margin before provision for losses for the year ended december  decreased million  or to million  from million for the same period for the decrease in net interest margin was primarily the result of the decline in average interest earning assets from billion in  to billion in in addition  the average cost of funds of the company increased to in from in due to an overall market increase in short term interest rates  and to a lesser extent  fees paid and rate increases associated with the company s recourse borrowings 
provision for losses increased to million in  or of average interest earning assets  from million or during the provision for losses increased as a result of an overall increase in credit risk retained from securities issued by the company principally for securities issued in the latter portion of  and a charge of million in the fourth quarter of due to the underperformance of the company s securitized manufactured housing loan portfolio 
the company has seen the loss severity on manufactured housing loans increase dramatically since the end of the third quarter of as a result of the saturation in the market place with both new and used repossessed manufactured housing units 
in addition  the company has seen some increase in overall default rates on its manufactured housing loans 
the company anticipates that market conditions for manufactured housing loans will remain unfavorable through net loss on sales  impairment charges and write downs decreased from an aggregated net loss of million in  to million in during  the company incurred losses related to the phasing out of its commercial production operations  including the sales of substantially all of the company s remaining commercial and multifamily loan positions 
in addition  as discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  the company was party to various conditional bond repurchase agreements whereby the company had the option to purchase million of tax exempt bonds secured by multifamily mortgage loans which expired in june the company did not exercise this option  as it did not have the ability to finance this purchase  and the counterparty to the agreement retained million in cash collateral as settlement as provided for in the related agreements

as a result of the sale of securities  the company either sold or terminated related derivative hedge positions at an aggregate net loss of million 
during  the company had gains of million related to various derivative trading positions opened and closed during the company had no such gains in net administrative fees and expenses to dhi decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in these decreases are principally a combined result of the sale of the company s model home purchase leaseback and manufactured housing loan production operations during all general and administrative expenses of these businesses were incurred by dhi 
compared to the decrease in net income and net income per common share during as compared to is primarily the result of i a decrease in net interest margin ii an increase in the loss on sale of investments and trading activities and iii write downs associated with the commercial loan production operations 
these decreases were partially offset by the reduction in general and administrative expenses and net administrative fees and expenses to dhi and the gain on the sale of the model home purchase leaseback and the manufactured housing lending operations in net interest margin for the year ended december  decreased to million  or  versus net interest margin of million for the same period in this decrease in net interest margin was primarily the result of the decline in average interest earning assets from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  in addition  provision for losses increased to million or on an annualized basis of interest earning assets during the year ended december   compared to million and during the same period in this increase in provision for losses was a result of increasing the reserve for probable losses on the various loan pools pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds where the company has retained credit risk 
during  dynex reit recorded a loss of million related to the writedown of million of multifamily and commercial loans held for sale at december  in addition  the company realized losses of million  which were primarily related to the write off of previously deferred hedging costs on million of multifamily and commercial loan commitments which expired and were not extended by the company during the fourth quarter of or the first quarter of these costs were related to now closed options and futures positions entered into by the company in and the net loss on sale of investments and trading activities for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the same period in the increase for the year ended december  is primarily the result of a million loss on the sale of million of securities during and a million loss on the sale of million of commercial loans during these increases were partially offset by million of realized gains on various derivative trading positions entered into during the loss on sale of investments and trading activities during is primarily the results of net losses recognized of million on trading positions entered into during during  dynex reit recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the funding notes and other autobond securities held by the company at december  in addition  dynex reit recorded a charge of million related to the establishment of a reserve for the autobond litigation discussed in item legal proceedings 
during  dynex reit recorded charges to earnings totaling million in regard to autobond related assets 
this charge included an impairment charge on the funding notes of million and million to other autobond related securities 
net administrative fees and expenses to dhi decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of decreased origination volume of the company s commercial loan production operations and the sale of the company s model home purchase leaseback and manufactured housing loan production operations during the following table summarizes the average balances of interest earning assets and their average effective yields  along with the average interest bearing liabilities and the related average effective interest rates  for each of the periods presented

effective rates are calculated excluding non interest related collateralized bond expenses and provision for credit losses 
compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  decreased to  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the increased cost of interest bearing liabilities as the result of overall increases in short term rates between the years 
a substantial portion of the company s interest bearing liabilities reprice monthly  and are indexed to one month libor  which on average increased to for  versus for this increase in one month libor accounts for a substantial portion of the overall increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the company also experienced overall increases in borrowing costs on its recourse debt as a result of extension fees  covenant violations and other related issues during the overall yield on interest earnings assets  increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in  benefited from the rising rate environment  but lagging relative to the company s liabilities 
individually  the net interest spread on collateral for collateralized bonds decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in this decrease was largely due to the effect of the increase in short term rates during the year 
the net interest spread on securities decreased to a negative basis points for the year ended december   from a negative basis points for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of increased borrowing costs on securities due to both the increase in the average one month libor during the nine months ended september  as well as an increase in the interest spread on certain credit facilities during the past twelve months 
the net interest spread on other investments increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december   to basis points for the same period in  primarily due to the sale or paydown of lower yielding investments  leaving principally the higher yielding delinquent property tax receivables 
the net interest spread on loans held for sale decreased basis points for the year ended december  from basis points to basis points for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased borrowing costs due to a the increase in the average one month libor during  b increases in the interest spread on certain credit facilities  c higher fees as a result of violation of certain covenants under certain of these facilities in  and d fees for extensions of these facilities to provide additional time for the company to sell the related collateral  principally loans held for sale and funding notes and securities 
compared to the net interest spread increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in this increase was primarily due to a reduction in premium amortization expense related to collateral for collateralized bonds  which decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the overall yield on interest earnings assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in individually  the net interest spread on collateral for collateralized bonds increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in this increase was primarily due to lower premium amortization caused by decreased prepayments during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the net interest spread on securities decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to a negative basis points for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a basis point increase during of the interest spread on the notes payable secured by the funding notes  and the sale of certain higher coupon collateral during the third quarter of in addition  several of the company s residual arm trusts were placed on non accrual status during the third quarter of the net interest spread on other investments increased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the same period in  primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding property tax receivables during the net interest spread on loans held for sale or securitization decreased basis points  from basis points for the year ended december   to basis points for the same period in this decrease is primarily attributable to the funding of lower coupon collateral during the following tables summarize the amount of change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in interest rates versus changes in volume to to rate volume total rate volume total collateral for collateralized bonds      securities      other investments     loans held for sale or securitization     total interest income       non recourse debt       recourse debt collateralized bonds      retained total collateralized bonds       recourse debt secured by investments securities       other investments     loans held for sale or securitization      recourse debt unsecured     total interest expense       net margin on portfolio      note the change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be segregated  has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

amortization expense as a percentage of principal paydowns has increased to for the year ended december  from in as the company experienced higher prepayment activity during on its securitized single family loan portfolio which it owns above par 
the amortization expense as a percentage of principal paydowns increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in primarily due to the addition of premium at the very end of from the securitization of approximately million of multifamily and commercial loans

will have a material impact on its financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations from a variety of sources 
these sources have included cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  including net interest income and principal payments and prepayments  common stock offerings through the dividend reinvestment plan  short term warehouse lines of credit with commercial and investment banks  repurchase agreements and the capital markets via the asset backed securities market which provides long term non recourse funding of the investment portfolio via the issuance of collateralized bonds 
historically  cash flow generated from the investment portfolio has satisfied its working capital needs  and the company has had sufficient access to capital to fund its loan production operations  on both a short term prior to securitization and long term after securitization basis 
however  market conditions since october have substantially reduced the company s access to capital 
the company is currently unable to access short term warehouse lines of credit  and is unable to efficiently access the asset backed securities market to meet its long term funding needs 
largely as a result of its inability to access additional capital  the company sold its manufactured housing and model home purchase leaseback operations in  and ceased issuing new commitments in its commercial lending operations 
for all of  the company was focused on substantially reducing both its short term debt and capital requirements  generally through the sale of assets 
during  the company reduced its recourse debt by approximately million  from million at december  to million at december  recourse debt was reduced primarily through the sale of various assets of the company 
as of march   the company has fully satisfied all of its warehouse facility obligations  has been or was released from all obligations under letters of credit or conditional bond repurchase obligations  and had reduced its repurchase agreement borrowings to million 
non recourse debt dynex reit  through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  has issued non recourse debt in the form of collateralized bonds to fund the majority of its investment portfolio 
the obligations under the collateralized bonds are payable solely from the collateral for collateralized bonds and are otherwise non recourse to dynex reit 
collateral for collateralized bonds are not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class of collateralized bonds is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   dynex reit had billion of collateralized bonds outstanding 
recourse debt secured 
at december   the company had a secured non revolving credit facility under which million of letters of credit to support tax exempt bonds were outstanding 
these letters of credit were secured  in part  by million in cash held in escrow 
these letters of credit were released during the first quarter of as a result of the purchase  sale or transfer of the underlying tax exempt bonds  and the facility was extinguished 
the company also uses repurchase agreements to finance a portion of its investments  which generally have maturities of thirty days or less 
repurchase agreements allow the company to sell investments for cash together with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same investments on a specified date for a price which is equal to the original sales price plus an interest component 
at december   the company had repurchase agreements outstanding of million  all with lehman brothers  inc these repurchase agreements remain on an overnight or one day basis  and were secured by securities with an unpaid principal balance of approximately million  and a fair value of approximately million 
the majority of these securities are rated investment grade 
increases in short term interest rates  long term interest rates or market risk could negatively impact the valuation of securities and may limit the company s borrowing ability or cause various lenders to initiate margin calls for securities financed using repurchase agreements 
additionally  certain investments are classes of securities rated aa  a or bbb that are subordinated to other classes from the same series of securities 
such subordinated classes may have less liquidity than securities that are not subordinated and the value of such classes is more dependent on the credit rating of the related insurer or the credit performance of the underlying loans or receivables 
in instances of a downgrade of an insurer or the deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying collateral  the company may be required to sell certain investments in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of the assets  which could result in losses 
unsecured 
as of december   the company has million outstanding of its senior unsecured notes issued in july and due july  the july notes 
on march   the company entered into an amendment to the related indenture governing the july notes whereby the company pledged to the trustee of the july notes substantially all of the company s unencumbered assets and the stock of its subsidiaries 
in consideration of this pledge  the indenture was further amended to provide for the release of the company from certain covenant restrictions in the indenture  and specifically provided for the company s ability to make distributions on its capital stock in an amount not to exceed the sum of a million  b the cash proceeds of any permitted subordinated indebtedness  c the cash proceeds of the issuance of any qualified capital stock  and d any distributions required in order for the company to maintain its reit status 
in addition  the company entered into a purchase agreement with holders of of the notes which require the purchase by the company of such securities at various discounts based on a computation of available cash 
on march   the company retired an additional million of the july notes for million in cash under the purchase agreement 
the discounts provided for under the purchase agreement are as follows by april    by july    by october    by january    by march    thereafter until maturity  
the table below sets forth the recourse debt and recourse debt to equity of the company as of december    and total recourse debt decreased from billion for december  to billion for december  and billion in these decreases are the result of the company s efforts since the end of to reduce its exposure to recourse debt through the securitization or sale of assets 
recourse debt as a percentage of equity also declined as a result of pay downs on recourse debt  offset partially by the company s declining equity base due to the increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses and operating losses in total recourse debt in millions total recourse debt to december  total recourse debt equity summary of selected quarterly results unaudited amounts in thousands except share data first second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  quarter operating results total revenues     net interest margin     net loss    basic net loss per common share

forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by general economic conditions 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
the company relies on a repurchase facility with an investment banking firm to help provide the company s short term funding needs 
the company s access to alternative or additional sources of financing has been significantly reduced 
capital markets 
the company relies on the capital markets for the sale upon securitization of its collateralized bonds or other types of securities 
while the company has historically been able to sell such collateralized bonds and securities into the capital markets  the company s access to capital markets has been substantially reduced  which may impair the company s ability to call and re securitize its existing securitizations in the future 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the loans currently pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds by the company are fixed rate 
the company currently finances these fixed rate assets through non recourse debt  approximately million of which is variable rate 
in addition  a significant amount of the investments held by the company are variable rate collateral for collateralized bonds 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term collateralized bonds and  to a lesser extent  recourse short term repurchase agreements 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have periodic interest rate caps and the related borrowing have no such interest rate caps 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans retained by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company at the time of securitization 
the allowance for losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severities may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks on loans that were delinquent as of december  prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market has adversely affected the company  and may continue to do so 
regulatory changes 
the company s businesses as of december  are not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools or its ability to collect on its delinquent property tax receivables 
risks and uncertainties 
see note to the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest income comprises the primary component of the company s earnings 
as a result  the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or reprice within specified periods 
the company s strategy has been to mitigate interest rate risk through the creation of a diversified investment portfolio of high quality assets that  in the aggregate  preserves the company s capital base while generating stable income in a variety of interest rate and prepayment environments 
the company monitors the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and market value of its investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
the company measures the sensitivity of its net interest income  excluding various accounting adjustments including provision for losses  and premium and discount amortization  to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
the company estimates its interest income for the next twelve months assuming no changes in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income  excluding various accounting adjustments as set forth above 
the following table summarizes the company s net interest margin sensitivity analysis as of december  this analysis represents management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin given a parallel shift in interest rates 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the model considers the effects of these embedded options when projecting cash flows and earnings 
the most significant option affecting the company s portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
while the company s model considers these factors  the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  its projected results assume no additions or subtractions to the company s portfolio  and no change to the company s liability structure 
historically  the company has made significant changes to its assets and liabilities  and is likely to do so in the future 
basis point change in net increase decrease in interest margin from interest rates base case base the company s investment policy sets forth guidelines for assuming interest rate risk 
the investment policy stipulates that given a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the estimated net interest margin may not change by more than of current net interest margin during the subsequent one year period approximately billion of the company s investment portfolio as of december  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately and of the arm loans underlying the company s arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor and one year cmt  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  the company s net interest spread earned on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i the lag in resets of the arm loans underlying the arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings and ii rate resets on the arm loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as short term interest rates stabilize and the arm loans reset  the net interest margin may be restored to its former level as the yields on the arm loans adjust to market conditions 
conversely  net interest margin may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the arm loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
in each case  however  the company expects that the increase or decrease in the net interest spread due to changes in the short term interest rates to be temporary 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that the company has entered into such agreements 
the remaining portion of the company s investments portfolio as of december   approximately billion  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
the company has substantially limited its interest rate risk on such investments through i the issuance of fixed rate collateralized bonds and notes payable which approximated billion as of december   and ii equity  which approximated million as of the same date 
overall  the company s interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates  and to the level of short term interest rates
