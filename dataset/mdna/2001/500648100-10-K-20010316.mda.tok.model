item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a predecessor corporation to the company was formed in july under the name of kos pharmaceuticals  inc principally to conduct research and development on new formulations of existing prescription pharmaceutical products 
in june  aeropharm technology  inc aeropharm  a then majority owned subsidiary of the company  was formed to conduct research and development activities on aerosolized products for the treatment of respiratory diseases 
during june  this predecessor corporation acquired the outstanding minority interest in aeropharm  changed its name to kos holdings  inc holdings  established the company as a wholly owned subsidiary under the name of kos pharmaceuticals  inc  and  effective as of june   transferred all of its existing assets  liabilities and intellectual property  other than certain net operating loss carryforwards  to the company 
accordingly  all references in this k filing to the company s business include the business and operations of holdings until june  on march   the company completed an initial public offering ipo of its common stock 
through december   the company had accumulated a deficit from operations of approximately million 
in connection with the transfer of operations from holdings to the company on june   net operating loss carryforwards amounting to approximately million and related tax benefits were retained by holdings and not transferred to the company 
consequently  the company may utilize net operating losses sustained subsequent to june   amounting to approximately million as of december   to offset future taxable net income  if any 
from inception through its june   reporting period  the company was a development stage company engaged primarily in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory pharmaceutical products 
on july   the company was granted clearance by the fda to market its lead product  niaspan 
the company began shipping niaspan to wholesalers in mid august and began detailing niaspan to physicians in september the company s board of directors changed the end of the company s fiscal year from june to december effective with its december   reporting period 
fiscal years presented and referred to in the company s consolidated financial statements  along with all other financial data  have been restated to conform with a december fiscal year basis 
results of operations years ended december  and the company s revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase was attributable to a growth of million in net sales of the company s niaspan product  and to an increase of million in co promotion revenue resulting from the company s co promotion agreement with knoll pharmaceutical company hereinafter knoll  for the promotion of knoll s mavik and tarka products within the united states the knoll agreement 
under the terms of the knoll agreement  the company receives an increasing percentage of revenue based on sales thresholds 
during the years ended december  and  certain customers of the company purchased abnormally high levels of the niaspan product 
the company believes that these higher than expected niaspan purchases were primarily due to seasonal fluctuations in customer purchasing patterns rather than underlying market demand for the niaspan product 
as a result  at december  and  the amount of the company s niaspan product being warehoused by these customers increased above normal levels 
the company has deferred the recognition of million and million in revenues and related expenses associated with these sales  as of december  and  respectively  until the level of the company s niaspan product warehoused by these customers returns to normal levels 
cost of sales was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the higher cost of sales in was attributable to higher niaspan volume during the period  partially offset by efficiencies attained in the production of niaspan 
the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increased expenses related primarily to increases of million in personnel and personnel related costs  of million in formulation development costs for products under development  of million in costs associated with nda submission expenses for the company s single tablet niaspan lovastatin combination product the combination product  and of million in costs associated with licensing activities 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease of million in the costs of clinical trials resulting from the completion of most of the clinical trial activities associated with the submission of a new drug application nda to the us food and drug administration for the combination product during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses remained at the same level overall for the years ended december  and within this category  however  selling expenses decreased million primarily as a result of a decrease of million in sales force operating expenses  and of million in marketing programs in support of niaspan 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in marketing costs associated with mavik and tarka promotional efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the preceding period  primarily as a result of an increase of million in royalty expenses associated with the increase in net sales of the niaspan product  and of an increase of million in personnel and personnel related costs 
the company is subject to the terms of the july   million credit facility the credit facility  the september   million credit facility the supplemental credit facility  and the december   million credit facility the standby facility  with michael jaharis  chairman of the company s board of directors and its principal shareholder 
borrowings under these credit facilities totaled million as of december  and bear interest at the prime rate as of december  
interest expense under these credit facilities totaled approximately million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  years ended december  and the company s revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a growth of million in net sales of the company s niaspan product and to million in co promotion revenue resulting from the knoll agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  certain customers of the company purchased abnormally high levels of the company s niaspan product 
the company believes that this higher than expected niaspan demand was primarily due to seasonal fluctuations in customer purchasing patterns 
prior to  the company had not been materially affected by seasonal fluctuations in customer purchasing patterns 
as a result  at december   the amount of the company s niaspan product being warehoused by these customers increased above normal levels 
the company deferred the recognition of million in revenues and related expenses associated with these sales until the level of the company s niaspan product warehoused by these customers returned to normal levels 
cost of sales was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the higher cost of sales in was attributable to higher sales of the niaspan product during the period  partially offset by efficiencies attained in the production of niaspan 
the company s research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the reduced expenses related primarily to decreases of million in formulation development costs of the company s combination product and other products under development  of million in medical education programs in support of the niaspan product  and of million in development costs paid to other parties 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million in the costs of clinical trials principally associated with the company s combination product 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  selling expenses decreased million  primarily as a result of a million reduction in marketing program costs and other costs associated with the niaspan product  the reduction principally reflects the absence of launch expenses incurred in this reduction was partially offset by million in mavik and tarka marketing expenses  and by an increase of million in personnel and personnel related costs as a result of the full impact of the presence  during the period  of the company s expanded sales and marketing organization 
general and administrative costs increased to million for the period  from million during the preceding period  primarily as a result of an increase of million in royalty expenses associated with the increase in net sales of the niaspan product 
during  the company received million in net proceeds from its march ipo and million in net proceeds from an october follow on offering of its common stock 
during  the remaining net proceeds from these offerings  along with other cash balances  were invested primarily in us treasury and highly rated corporate debt securities 
the company recorded million of interest income for the year ended december   as a result of these investments

the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  years ended december  and the company s revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the company began sales of its niaspan product to wholesalers during august cost of sales was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the higher cost of sales in was attributable to higher sales of the niaspan product during the period 
the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the change related primarily to increases of million during the period in connection with formulation development of the company s combination product and other products under development  million in medical education programs in support of niaspan  and million in personnel and personnel related costs in support of the company s expanded research and development activities 
these increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by a million fee received by the company in related to the exchange of certain technology rights with another unaffiliated company 
the increases were also partially offset by the absence of a million charge attributable to entering into an agreement  in february  with an unaffiliated generic drug manufacturer to resolve  as between themselves  the effects of a potential patent interference proceeding  of million of licensing fees associated with obtaining access to certain aerosol safety and toxicology data  and of million of development costs paid to third parties in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  selling expenses increased million as a result of the continued expansion of the company s sales and marketing organization and the initiation of a variety of marketing programs in connection with the niaspan product 
general and administrative costs also increased during the period  mostly as a result of increases of million in personnel and personnel related costs  million in royalty expenses for the company s niaspan product  and other expenses associated with the expanded activities of the company 
from july   to the completion of its ipo on march   the company funded its operations from the proceeds of a loan from kos investments  inc the convertible note  the sole shareholder of holdings 
the convertible note and its accrued interest were convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price per share equal to the ipo price per share 
interest expense under the convertible note totaled million for the year ended december  on october   the outstanding principal and interest of the convertible note was converted into  shares of common stock 
at the time of conversion  the convertible note accrued interest at a rate of per year and had outstanding principal and interest of million and million  respectively 
the company recorded million and million of interest income for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of its investment in marketable securities from the net proceeds of the ipo and the follow on offering 
the company also recorded  mostly as a result of the credit facility during the period and of the convertible note during the period   and million of interest expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and negative working capital of million 
the company s primary uses of cash to date have been to fund selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses  including clinical trials 
as of december   the company s investment in equipment and leasehold improvements  net of depreciation and amortization  was million 
during the year ended december   the company spent million in capital expenditures 
the company expects to increase the level of capital expenditures during mostly to provide increased production capacity for the combination product 
accordingly  capital expenditures are expected to be significantly higher than those incurred during the year ended december  on july   the company entered into a million credit facility the credit facility with michael jaharis  chairman of the company s board of directors and its principal shareholder 
on june   in order to reduce interest costs  the company utilized the proceeds of a million equity contribution from dupont pharmaceuticals company dupont to pay off borrowings made under the credit facility 
in connection with this loan repayment  mr 
jaharis agreed to continue to make available to the company the full original borrowing capacity of the credit facility  provided that future company borrowings from mr 
jaharis be first made from the existing borrowing capacity of mr 
jaharis other credit lines with kos 
all other terms of the credit facility remain in full force and effect 
borrowings under the credit facility totaled million as of december   bear interest at the prime rate as of december   and are due december  on september   the company formally agreed to the terms of an additional million funding arrangement initially entered into with michael jaharis on october  the supplemental credit facility 
borrowings under the supplemental credit facility totaled million as of december   bear interest at the prime rate  are convertible at per share into shares of the company s common stock  and will be due december  as of december   the conversion of amounts borrowed from mr 
jaharis under the supplemental credit facility into shares of the company s common stock would have resulted in the issuance of  additional shares of the company s common stock  thus causing material dilution to existing shareholders of the company 
on december   mr 
jaharis agreed to extend another million loan to the company the standby facility 
borrowings made under the standby facility totaled million as of december   are due june   and are also subject to most of the terms and conditions of borrowings made under the supplemental credit facility 
borrowings made under the standby facility are not  however  convertible into shares of the company s common stock 
in lieu of a conversion feature  the company has granted to mr 
jaharis non detachable warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share  which approximates the market value of the company s common stock on the effective date of the standby facility 
the warrants are exercisable at any time until june  the exercise of a significant number of the warrants issued under the standby facility will cause material dilution to existing shareholders of the company 
the company entered into an agreement  effective may   with dupont to form a strategic alliance for the purpose of co promoting the company s combination product  now in development  in the united states and canada the dupont agreement 
under the terms of the dupont agreement  the company and dupont will share in the future development and commercialization of the company s combination product 
specifically  dupont has agreed i to make equity investments in the company up to million through the date of food and drug administration fda approval of the combination product  ii to pay the company million in milestone payments upon fda approval of the combination product  iii to fund up to million for future clinical development of the combination product  and iv to share equally in the costs associated with promoting the combination product and share equally in product profits after deducting a royalty to the company 
on may   dupont made a million equity investment in the company in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
although the company currently anticipates that  including the capital available to the company under the credit facility  the supplemental credit facility and the standby facility  it has or has access to an amount of working capital that will be sufficient to fund the company s operations until it has positive cash flows  the company s cash requirements during this period will be substantial and may exceed the amount of working capital available to the company 
the company s ability to fund its operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital until it achieves positive cash flows will depend primarily on its ability to generate substantial growth in sales of its niaspan product  to receive approval of the nda for the company s combination product on a timely basis  and to successfully market the combination product 
further  during this period  the company s ability to fund its operating requirements may  among other things  be affected by its ability to reduce its operating expenses 
the company s failure to generate substantial growth in the sales of niaspan  reduce operating expenses  obtain regulatory approval for its combination product  or meet the conditions necessary for the company to obtain funding under the credit facility  the supplemental credit facility and the standby facility  and other events including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of the company s products under development  the company s ability to obtain regulatory approvals  the company s ability to manufacture products at an economically feasible cost  costs in filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent and terms of any collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing  joint venture  or other arrangements  and changes in economic  regulatory  or competitive conditions or the company s planned business could cause the company to require additional capital prior to achieving positive cash flows 
in the event that the company must raise additional capital to fund its working capital needs  it may seek to raise such capital through loans or the issuance of debt securities that would require the consent of the company s current lender  or through the issuance of equity securities 
to the extent the company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity  ownership dilution to existing shareholders will result  and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing shareholders 
moreover  there can be no assurance that any additional capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
forward looking information certain cautionary statements certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report that are not related to historical results are forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward looking statements 
further  certain forward looking statements are based upon assumptions of future events  which may not prove to be accurate 
subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or to persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
market acceptance and sales growth of niaspan the company s success currently depends primarily upon its ability to successfully market and sell increasing quantities of its niaspan product 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the niaspan product will depend significantly on the increasing acceptance of the niaspan product by physicians and their patients 
the company believes that intolerable flushing and potential liver toxicity associated with currently available formulations of niacin are the principal reasons why physicians generally have been reluctant to prescribe or recommend such currently available formulations 
flushing episodes are often characterized by facial redness  tingling or rash 
although most patients taking the niaspan product will sometimes flush  the formulation and dosing regimen for niaspan have been designed to maximize patient acceptance and minimize the occurrence of flushing 
there can be no assurance  however  that patients using the niaspan product will not suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable 
the failure of physicians to prescribe the niaspan product or the failure of patients to continue taking niaspan due to intolerable flushing or to other side effects would have a material adverse effect on the company 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning the niaspan product or any other product incorporating technology similar to that used in the niaspan product also could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain regulatory approvals  to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  or patients  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
uncertainties related to fda approval of the combination product the company has submitted an nda to the fda for the combination product 
if the fda believes that the results of the pivotal clinical trials for the combination product do not establish the safety and efficacy of the combination product in the treatment of any or all of the referenced indications  the company will not receive the approvals necessary to market the combination product 
failure to obtain fda approval to market the combination product on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on the company  including delaying or terminating the company s right to receive milestone payments under the co promotion agreement for the combination product 
the company may be required to conduct additional clinical trials in order to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the combination product 
such trials  among other things  could delay the approval of the nda for the combination product  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of the combination product on a timely basis  or at all 
history of operating losses  uncertainty of future profitability to date  the company has dedicated most of its financial resources to the development and commercialization of its niaspan product  the development of other products  and general and administrative expenses 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses for at least the next twelve months  due primarily to continued manufacturing and marketing  sales and administrative expenses associated with the niaspan product  with the anticipated commercial launch of the combination product  and for investments in its research and development programs 
no assurance can be given that additional significant losses will not continue thereafter 
the company s ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend  among other things  on the commercial success of the niaspan product  on the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval for and achieve market acceptance for the combination product  to successfully exploit its manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  to complete the development of  and obtain regulatory approvals for  and achieve market acceptance for its other products under development  and on its ability to maintain sufficient funds to finance its activities 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
in connection with the transfer of operations from holdings to the company on june   net operating loss carryforwards amounting to approximately million and related tax benefits remained with holdings and were not transferred to the company 
consequently  the company may utilize net operating loss carryforwards sustained subsequent to june   amounting to million as of december   to offset future taxable net income  if any 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to achieve profitability to utilize such carryforwards or that profitability  if any  can be sustained 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since its inception 
the company has spent and will continue to be required to spend substantial funds to continue research and development  including clinical trials of its products under development  and to commercialize the niaspan product and its products under development if regulatory approvals are obtained for such products under development 
the company believes that it has sufficient resources  including funds available to the company under certain funding arrangements  to fund the operations of the company until the company achieves positive cash flows 
the company  however  may need or may elect to raise additional capital prior to such date 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  primarily relating to the near term commercial success of niaspan  the company s ability to obtain regulatory approval for  and successfully market  the combination product  the company s ability to meet the conditions necessary to obtain funding under the credit facility and the standby facility  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by companies at this stage of development  the progress of the company s research  development  and clinical trial programs  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of the company s products under development  the company s ability to obtain such regulatory approvals  costs in filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent and terms of any collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing  or other arrangements  and changes in economic  regulatory  or competitive conditions or the company s planned business 
estimates about the adequacy of funding for the company s activities are based on certain assumptions  including assumptions regarding the marketing and sales success of the company s niaspan product  the regulatory and commercial success of the combination product  and that testing and regulatory procedures relating to the company s products under development can be conducted at projected costs and within projected time frames 
there can be no assurances that any of these assumptions will prove to be accurate 
to satisfy its capital requirements  the company may seek to raise funds in the public or private capital markets 
the company s ability to raise additional funds in the public markets may be adversely affected if the company s sales of its niaspan product do not increase rapidly  if the company is not able to obtain regulatory approval for  and successfully market  the combination product  if the results of the company s clinical trials for its products under development are not favorable  or if regulatory approval for any of the company s products under development is not obtained 
the company may seek additional funding through corporate collaborations and other financing vehicles 
there can be no assurance that any such funding will be available to the company  or if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly one or more of its research or development programs or it may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with future collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to the niaspan product  to the combination product  or to some or all of its technologies or products under development or take significant cost reducing actions or both 
if the company is successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of common stock 
limited sales and marketing experience and resources although the company markets its niaspan product and the mavik and tarka products and intends to market the combination product and its other products under development through its own specialty sales force  its current marketing resources are limited 
substantial resources will continue to be required for the company to promote the sale of the niaspan  mavik and tarka products  the combination product  and its products under development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to devote resources to the niaspan  mavik and tarka products  to the combination product  or to its other products under development sufficient to achieve increasing market acceptance 
the company s failure to expend the resources to adequately promote the niaspan  mavik and tarka products  the combination product  or its products under development would have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  the company has fewer sales persons than many of its competitors and there can be no assurance that the company s sales force will be able to detail successfully physicians who prescribe lipid altering medications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its current sales representatives  that any additional representatives hired by the company will be immediately effective in promoting the sale of the niaspan  mavik and tarka products  or that the company s sales representatives will be able to generate significantly increased sales of the niaspan  mavik and tarka products 
the failure of the company s sales representatives to generate increased sales of the niaspan product would have a material adverse effect on the company 
control by existing shareholder michael jaharis  the chairman of the board of directors of the company and one of its founders  owns  directly or indirectly  approximately of the common stock outstanding as of december  accordingly  this shareholder can control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in the company s articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership by one person  along with the factors described in a subsequent section  anti takeover provisions  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of the company 
in addition  the supplemental credit facility gives mr 
jaharis the right to convert at per share amounts owed to mr 
jaharis by the company into shares of the company s common stock and the standby facility gives mr 
jaharis the right to exercise warrants to purchase up to million shares of the company s common stock 
if this conversion option or warrant exercise were to occur  mr 
jaharis would own a significantly greater percentage of the company s outstanding common stock thus resulting in substantial dilution to existing shareholders 
competition and technological change many products are commercially available for the treatment of elevated ldl cholesterol  and the manufacturers of such products  individually and collectively  have significantly greater financial resources and sales and manufacturing capabilities than the company  including a combined field sales force exceeding  representatives compared with the company s approximately person field sales force 
the company estimates that its existing niaspan prescriptions account for approximately of the total prescriptions currently being written in the united states for cholesterol lowering pharmaceutical compounds 
there can be no assurance that niaspan  the combination product  or any other product developed by the company will be able to compete successfully with any of those products or that the company will be able to overcome such competition and achieve increasing sales of its niaspan product 
moreover  the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is available in several other formulations  most of which do not require a prescription 
although the company believes that there are no other currently available niacin formulations that have been approved by the fda specifically for once a day dosing  there can be no assurance that physicians will not prescribe or recommend some of these unapproved niacin formulations  using the niaspan product s dosing regimen  to try to achieve the same results as niaspan 
substitution of other niacin formulations for the niaspan product could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  manufacturers of other niacin formulations could promote their products using the niaspan product s dosing regimen and could promote the sale of their products to treat the indications for which the company has received clearance to market niaspan 
although such promotion would be a violation of fda regulations  the occurrence of such practices would have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  many established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  and other research institutions with resources significantly greater than the company s may develop products that directly compete with the company s products 
even if the company s products under development prove to be more effective than those developed by other entities  such other entities may be more successful in marketing their products than the company because of greater financial resources  stronger sales and marketing efforts  and other factors 
these entities may succeed in developing products that are safer  more effective or less costly than the products developed by the company 
there can be no assurance that any products developed by the company will be able to compete successfully with any of those products 
no assurance of adequate third party reimbursement the company s ability to commercialize successfully its products under development is dependent in part on the extent to which appropriate levels of reimbursement for the niaspan product  the combination product  or for the company s products under development are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers  and managed care organizations such as health maintenance organizations hmos 
managed care organizations and other third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states  the growth of organizations such as hmos  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products  resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for niaspan  the combination product  or the company s products under development 
such cost containment measures and potential legislative reform could affect the company s ability to sell niaspan  the combination product  or its products under development and may have a material adverse effect on the company 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
although the company has obtained approvals for reimbursement for the cost of niaspan from many third party payers  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such approvals 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries will be available for niaspan  the combination product  or any of the company s products under development  that any reimbursement granted will be maintained  or that limits on reimbursement available from third party payors will not reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  niaspan  the combination product  or the company s products under development 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party reimbursement for niaspan  the combination product  or the company s products under development would have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company is dependent on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  management and sales personnel 
the company faces intense competition for personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities  and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for the expansion of the company s activities  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and its business 
products under development although the company obtained clearance from the fda to market the niaspan product  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully formulate any of its other products as planned  or that the company will be successful in demonstrating the safety and efficacy of such products in human clinical trials 
these trials may be costly and time consuming 
the administration of any product the company develops may produce undesirable side effects that could result in the interruption  delay or suspension of clinical trials  or the failure to obtain fda or other regulatory approval for any or all targeted indications 
even if regulatory approval is secured  the company s products under development may later produce adverse effects that limit or prevent their widespread use or that necessitate their withdrawal from the market 
the company may discontinue the development of any of its products under development at any time 
patents and trademarks  interference the company s ability to commercialize any of its products under development will depend  in part  on its or its licensors ability to obtain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
in addition  the patents for which the company has applied relating to niaspan and certain other of the company s products under development are based on  among other things  the timed administration of niaspan 
if the indications treated by niaspan and such other products under development could be treated using drugs without such timed administration  the company s patents  if issued  would not prevent the use of such drugs for the treatment of such indications  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the patent applications licensed to or owned by the company will result in issued patents  that patent protection will be secured for any particular technology  that any patents that have been or may be issued to the company or its licensors will be valid or enforceable or that any patents will provide meaningful protection to the company 
in general  the us patents and patent applications owned by or licensed to the company are method of use patents that cover the timed use of certain compounds to treat specified conditions 
composition of matter protection is not available for the active ingredient in niaspan 
the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is currently sold in the united states and other markets for lipid altering and for other uses 
even in jurisdictions where the use of the active ingredient in niaspan for lipid altering and other indications may be covered by the claims of a use patent licensed to the company  off label sales might occur  especially if another company markets the active ingredient at a price that is less than the price of niaspan  thereby potentially reducing the sales of niaspan 
the us patent and trademark office pto has issued us patents numbers  and  to the company with claims covering niaspan s method of use consistent with its recommended once a day dosing regimen 
on february   the company and a privately owned generic manufacturer which allegedly claims the same dosing regimen invention as that of the niaspan product  entered into a cross licensing agreement the license agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to resolve  as between themselves  the effects of such potential interference by granting licenses under their respective patents 
the company is aware that certain european and us patents have been issued with claims covering products that contain certain non cfc propellant driven aerosol formulations 
the european patents are currently subject to an opposition proceeding in europe  and certain claims in such patents have been held invalid in the united kingdom 
certain or all of the company s aerosol products under development may use a formulation covered by such european or us patents 
in such event  the company would be prevented from making  using or selling such products unless the company obtains a license under such patents  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or unless such patents are determined to be invalid or unenforceable in europe or the united states  respectively 
the company s development of products that are covered by such patents and its failure to obtain licenses under such patents in the event such patents are determined to be valid and enforceable could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance that the patents owned and licensed by the company  or any future patents  will prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products or that others will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of company products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any of the company s future products or methods will be patentable  that such products or methods will not infringe upon the patents of third parties  or that the company s patents or future patents will give the company an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents 
the company may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain a license  defend an infringement action  or challenge the validity of the patents in court 
there can be no assurance that a license will be available to the company  if at all  on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  or that the company will prevail in any patent litigation 
patent litigation is costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that the company will have or will devote sufficient resources to pursue such litigation 
if the company does not obtain a license under such patents  is found liable for infringement or is not able to have such patents declared invalid  the company may be liable for significant money damages  may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market  or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use  or sale of products or methods of treatment requiring such licenses 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in its product development activities 
to the extent that the company relies on trade secrets and unpatented know how to maintain its competitive technological position  there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies 
the company seeks to protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
nevertheless  these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of the company s confidential information and may not provide the company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
if the company s employees  scientific consultants or collaborators develop inventions or processes independently that may be applicable to the company s products under development  disputes may arise about ownership of proprietary rights to those inventions and processes 
such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the company s property  but may remain the property of those persons or their employers 
protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the company s proprietary rights 
failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company engages in collaborations  sponsored research agreements  and other arrangements with academic researchers and institutions that have received and may receive funding from us government agencies 
as a result of these arrangements  the us government or certain third parties may have rights in certain inventions developed during the course of the performance of such collaborations and agreements as required by law or such agreements 
several legislative bills affecting patent rights have been introduced in the united states congress 
these bills address various aspects of patent law  including publication  patent term  re examination subject matter and enforceability 
it is not certain whether any of these bills will be enacted into law or what form such new laws may take 
accordingly  the effect of such potential legislative changes on the company s intellectual property estate is uncertain 
government regulation  no assurances of regulatory approval the company s research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of its products are currently subject to extensive regulation by the fda and may in the future be subject to foreign regulations 
the drug approval process takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approval 
although the company may consult the fda for guidance in developing protocols for clinical trials  that consultation provides no assurance that the fda will accept the clinical trials as adequate or well controlled or accept the results of those trials 
in addition  delays or rejections of applications for regulatory approval may result from changes in or additions to fda regulations concerning the drug approval process 
similar delays may also be encountered in foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that any regulatory review will be conducted in a timely manner or that regulatory approvals will be obtained for any products developed by the company 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval may be limited as to the indicated uses for which it may be promoted or marketed 
in addition  a marketed drug  its bulk chemical supplier  its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual regulatory review and periodic inspections  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  supplier  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturers  which may require a withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business is also subject to regulation under state  federal and local laws  rules  regulations and policies relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety  including those governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all such laws  rules  regulations and policies applicable to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the future 
the company s research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable state  federal and local regulations  the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company and materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on collaborators the company relies on various third parties for certain aspects of the development and promotion of the company s presently planned or future products  including the company s combination product 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
even if the company is successful in entering into such collaborative agreements  there can be no assurance that any such arrangement will be successful 
the success of any such arrangement is dependent on  among other things  the skills  experience and efforts of the third party s employees responsible for the project  the third party s commitment to the arrangement  and the financial condition of the third party  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
limited manufacturing experience  risk of scale up the company manufactures the niaspan product in one manufacturing plant that has been inspected and approved by the fda  and it expects to manufacture the combination product in another manufacturing plant where the clinical materials for its products under development are currently being manufactured 
the company believes both plants operate in substantial compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products 
the company may need to further scale up certain of its current manufacturing processes to achieve production levels consistent with the commercial sale of its products 
further  modifications to the facilities  systems and procedures may be necessary to maintain capacity at a level sufficient to meet market demand or to maintain compliance with cgmp regulations and other regulations prescribed by various regulatory agencies including the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
failure by the company to successfully further scale up  expand in connection with manufacture for commercial sale  or modify its manufacturing process or to comply with cgmp regulations and other regulations could delay the approval of the company s products under development or limit the company s ability to meet the demand for its products  either of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
such occurrences may require the company to acquire alternative means of manufacturing its products  which may not be available to the company on a timely basis  on commercially practicable terms  or at all 
dependence on single sources of supply some materials used in the company s products  including niacin  the active ingredient in niaspan  are currently sourced from a single qualified supplier 
the company does not have a contractual arrangement with its sole supplier of niacin 
although the company has not experienced difficulty to date in acquiring niacin  or other materials for product development  no assurance can be given that supply interruptions will not occur in the future or that the company will not have to obtain substitute materials  which would require additional product validations and regulatory submissions 
any such interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of such products 
risk of product liability claims  no assurance of adequate insurance manufacturing  marketing  selling  and testing niaspan  the combination product  and the company s products under development entails a risk of product liability 
the company could be subject to product liability claims in the event the company s products or products under development fail to perform as intended 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources and could damage the company s reputation and impair the marketability of the company s products 
while the company maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that a successful claim could not be made against the company  that the amount of indemnification payments or insurance would be adequate to cover the costs of defending against or paying such a claim  or that damages payable by the company would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations and on the price of the company s common stock 
shares eligible for future sale  registration rights the company has granted certain registration rights to the company s controlling shareholder and to kos investments  inc which entitle such entities to cause the company to effect three registrations under the securities act of sales of shares of the company s common stock owned by such entities 
these registration rights generally would also permit the holders of such rights to include shares in any registration statement otherwise filed by the company 
by exercising these registration rights  these entities could cause a large number of shares to be registered and become freely tradeable without restrictions under the securities act except for those purchased in the offering by affiliates of the company immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration 
such sales may have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock and could impair the company s ability to raise additional capital 
possible stock price volatility the stock market  including the nasdaq national market  on which the company s shares are listed  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market price of the company s common stock  like the stock prices of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
the sale by the company s controlling shareholder or members of the company s management of shares of common stock  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or its competitors  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to the niaspan product  the combination product  or to products under development by the company or its competitors  regulatory developments in either the united states or foreign countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and economic and other external factors  as well as the trend of prescriptions for the niaspan product and the period to period fluctuations in sales or other financial results  among other factors  may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
anti takeover provisions certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws  as well as the florida business corporation act  could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of the company without approval of the company s board of directors 
such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock 
certain of such provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
moreover  certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation or bylaws generally permit removal of directors only for cause by a vote of the shareholders of the company  require a vote of the shareholders to amend the company s articles of incorporation or bylaws  require a demand of at least of the company s shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders  and prohibit shareholder actions by written consent
