readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a developer and marketer of wireless  communications  diagnostic utility and ecommerce software products and a provider of professional consulting services 
we design integrated  cross platform  easy to use software for personal computing and business solutions and provide consulting services consisting of integrated internet business services to middle market companies 
our software includes products developed for the internet and broad band technologies  products that enable ecommerce  internet communications voice over ip  video conferencing  wireless communications  general system utility products and network fax along with traditional computer telephony 
we continue to develop new products that leverage off our core technologies to address the consumer s use of the internet and corporate intranets 
we intend to leverage our experience and position with original equipment manufacturers  commonly known as oems  to deploy these new product releases 
additionally  we are expanding our customer base to include manufacturers that produce devices that take advantage of the high bandwidth internet connectivity such as cable and xdsl modems 
our corporate products are designed to provide cost effective and efficient methods of communicating that take advantage of corporate local and wide area networks  including the internet or intranets 
through our consulting services  we offer a comprehensive suite of services to assist middle market clients in planning  implementing and supporting ecommerce  ebusiness and infrastructure initiatives 
in april  we expanded our macintosh division with the stf acquisition 
goodwill recorded in the acquisition of stf was  and is amortized over seven years 
in september  we merged with pcs to provide ecommerce business solutions 
in july  we acquired the touchstone checkit product line see note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquired technology recorded in the acquisition of the touchstone checkit asset was  and is amortized over three years through charges against cost of revenues 
also  in september  we acquired the consulting practice unit of quickstart technologies  inc  a provider of integrated internet business services to middle market companies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill recorded in the acquisition of the quickstart unit was  and is amortized over three years 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software as completed products are shipped and title passes  from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  and collection is deemed probable 
revenues for consulting services are recognized as such services are performed 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to introduce new products and our future success will depend in part on the continued introduction of new and enhanced oem  retail and corporate products that achieve market acceptance 
revenues are net of estimated returns and other adjustments at the time the products are shipped 
the oem product ordering cycle beginning from placement of an order to shipment is very short 
oem customers generally operate under a just in time system and order software to be delivered as needed by their manufacturing operations 
we generally ship our products as we receive orders and  accordingly  we have historically operated with little backlog 
we do not consider backlog to be a significant indication of future performance 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
moreover  we generally do not produce software in advance of orders and  therefore  have not maintained a material amount of software inventory 
beginning in the third quarter of  we renewed our commitment of resources and efforts towards the retail channel 
our effort coincided with the launch of our first retail internet telephony product  internet commsuite 
our strongest retail product continues to be hotfax messagecenter  which provides fax  answering machine and data communication functionality via the pc 
our acquisition of the touchstone product line in september has significantly increased our retail product offering 
we are in various retail outlets  particularly office supply chains such as staples  office depot and office max and numerous internet retail stores 
as a result of this expansion  sales to ingram micro  a retail distributor  were of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in inventory in the retail channel exposes us to product returns 
we consider this exposure when we establish allowances for product returns 
while returns have historically been estimatable  substantial returns of products from the retail channel could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenues software consulting services total net revenues cost of revenues software consulting services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss interest income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss years ended december    and revenues total net revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to  and  or  from to ingram micro  a distribution customer  accounted for  and of total revenues for  and respectively 
software 
net software revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or  from to the increase in net software revenue from to was due  in part  from additional retail sales provided by the touchstone acquisition which took place in july and from sales of our new quick link mobile software to cellular phone manufacturers 
software revenues accounted for of total revenues in and were not separately classified in the previous years being reported 
our efforts to diversify our markets generated the growth in our net software revenues with contributions to this increase coming from our retail product sales  additional sales of apple macintosh products as a result of the acquisition of stf in april and ecommerce products resulting from the acquisition of pcs in september consulting services 
consulting services revenues were million in and were not significant in or consulting services revenues were generated by the acquisition of pcs in september  which we expanded upon in  and the quickstart acquisition which took place in september consulting services revenue accounted for of total revenues in cost of revenues cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing no change from to and a decrease of  or  from to cost of software revenue as a percentage of software revenues was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of software revenue as a percentage of software revenues from to was due primarily to the continuation of increased oem business being derived from royalties as opposed to kitted product 
the decrease in cost of software revenue as a percentage of software revenue from to was attributable primarily to an increased amount of oem business being derived from royalties and an increase in the amount of retail sales in our overall sales mix 
cost of consulting service revenues 
cost of consulting service revenues was million in since we did not begin consulting services until september  cost of consulting service revenues was not significant in and non existent in cost of consulting services revenues includes the cost of our consulting personnel and the cost of hiring outside contractors to support our staff of consultants 
cost of consulting services revenues as a percentage of consulting services revenues in was 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to and an increase of million  or  from to our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
the decrease in our selling and marketing expenses in over was primarily the result of an approximate million reduction in spending for costs related to advertising and trade shows 
these savings were partially offset by increases in hiring related spending increases in our ecommerce business  including salaries and related personnel expenses and facilities expenses which totaled approximately  the increase in our selling and marketing expenses in over was primarily due to increased expenditures for our major retail products  and our expansion efforts in the ecommerce and macintosh markets 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct our software development efforts 
we remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology  particularly our internet technology 
our development efforts include work on our ecommerce products  internet telephony and videoconferencing products  including macintosh versions  wireless products and new digital cameras as they are developed 
the increase in our research and development expenses in over was primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses of approximately  which was offset by reductions in purchased technologies of approximately  the increase in our research and development expenses in over was primarily due to the additional engineering resources acquired in the expansion of our macintosh division through the acquisition of stf technologies 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to the increase in our general and administrative expenses in over resulted when reductions in salaries and related expenses of approximately  were offset by increases in consulting fees for investor relations of approximately  bad debt expense of approximately  primarily related to our ecommerce business and increased amortization expense of approximately  related to the acquisition of quickstart in september interest income 
interest income was   and  million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and a decrease of  or  from to deceases in our interest income  in each of years being reported  are directly related to the reductions in our cash balance 
we have not changed our investment strategy during the periods being reported on  with our excess cash consistently being invested in short term marketable securities 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion elsewhere in this annual report 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was   and a benefit of million in  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in is primarily due to taxes on increased foreign income 
we increased the provision for income taxes in over because we increased our valuation allowance to offset all deferred tax assets 
this increase was taken because  we believed at that time  our results of operations provided insufficient evidence that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we may reduce our valuation allowance in the future at such time when there is sufficient evidence that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from proceeds generated by our initial public offering in net cash used in operations was million in compared to million in and  in the primary use of cash in each year was the company s net loss 
we used  in  million in  and  in for investing activities 
our primary use of cash for investing activities in all years related to our acquisitions  including our acquisition of stf technologies in for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we also invested in property and equipment  including computers and production equipment  during each of  and in   was generated from financing activities  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
this compared to  in  which was offset by the repayment of a loan assumed in the acquisition of stf 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million of working capital and million in accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and other adjustments 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  which  among other things  addressed accounting consequences of a modification that reduces the exercise price of a fixed stock option award otherwise known as repricing 
if the exercise price of a fixed stock option award is reduced  the award must be accounted for as variable price stock plan from the date of the modification to the date the award is exercised  is forfeited  or expires unexercised 
the exercise price of an option award has been reduced if the fair value of the consideration required to be paid by the grantee upon exercise is less than or potentially less than the fair value of the consideration that was required to be paid pursuant to the award s original terms 
the requirements about modifications to fixed stock option awards that directly or indirectly reduce the exercise price of an award apply to modifications made after december   and was applied as of july  the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
sab was adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of and did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
risk factors before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  that could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the size and timing of orders from and shipments to our major customers  our ability to maintain or increase gross margins  general economic and market conditions  variations in the our sales channels or the mix of our product sales  the gain or loss of a key customer  our ability to specify  develop  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us  our competitors or our customers  the effect of new and emerging technologies  and deferrals of orders by our customers in anticipation of new products  applications  product enhancements or operating systems 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and capital lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our total revenue does not meet our expectations  we probably would not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
we recently began offering new services and products with which have limited prior experience 
we increased our ebusiness consulting services in september with the acquisition of the ebusiness consulting practice of quickstart technologies  inc in addition  we launched a new product line with the acquisition of the checkit r line of software products from touchstone software corporation and its affiliates in july the consulting segment of our business accounted for approximately of our revenue in we expect sales from our consulting practice and the checkit r product line to constitute an increasing portion of our future revenue growth 
however  we have limited prior experience and expertise providing consulting services and in building  managing and marketing a consulting practice 
similarly  although we have established distribution channels and marketing plans for selling retail products  the checkit r products are new to us and each new product line presents its own unique issues and challenges 
we are devoting significant resources to promoting awareness of our consulting services and our consulting related products  as well as the new checkit r line of products 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that the consulting portion of our business or the checkit r products will become or remain profitable 
if we are unable to build market awareness of the need for these products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
technology and customer needs change rapidly in our market which could render our products obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands  keep up with evolving industry standards  including changes in the microsoft operating systems with which our products are designed to be compatible  and to promote those products successfully 
the communications and utilities software markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and short product life cycles 
any of these factors could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers 
if the communications software markets do not develop as we anticipate or our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  or if we are unable to develop new versions of our software products that can operate on future operating systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations could by materially and adversely affected 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors 
we operate in markets that are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology 
microsoft corporation poses a significant competitive threat to us because the latest microsoft operating systems  windows  windows  windows and windows nt  include capabilities now provided by certain of our oem and retail software products 
if users are satisfied relying on the communications capabilities of windows  windows  windows  windows nt or other operating systems  sales of our products are likely to decline 
in addition  our principal fax related retail products  hotfaxmessagecenter and hotfax  currently compete directly with symantec s winfax pro 
our new internet communications software products  internet commsuite and videolink pro  presently compete with product offerings by microsoft  intel  white pine and vocaltech  among others 
our new checkit r products  checkit r netoptimizer  checkit r utilities  checkit r fastmove r  and checkit r suite  compete currently with mcafee s office pro  symantec s systemworks and ontrack s systemsuite  among others 
in addition  because there are low barriers to entry into the software market  we expect significant competition from other established and emerging software companies in the future 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential oem customers may acquire or develop products that compete directly with our products 
microsoft corporation and many of our other current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
there is also a substantial risk that announcements of competing products by large competitors such as microsoft and symantec could result in the cancellation of orders by retailers  distributors or other customers in anticipation of the introduction of such new products 
in addition  some of our competitors  such as symantec  currently make complementary products that are sold separately 
such competitors could decide to enhance their competitive position by bundling their products to attract customers seeking integrated  cost effective software applications 
some competitors have a retail emphasis and offer oem products with a reduced set of features 
the opportunity for retail upgrade sales may induce these and other competitors to make oem products available at their own cost or even at a loss 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations  which may lead to the creation of additional large and well financed competitors 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
we rely on one distributor for a significant portion of our total revenues 
sales to ingram micro  a retail distributor  represented of our net revenues for the year ended december   of our net revenues for the year ended december  and of our net revenues for the year ended december  we may not be able to control the factors influencing whether and in what quantity ingram purchases products from us 
the loss of  or a significant curtailment of  purchases by ingram micro could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to develop and maintain relationships with distributors and retailers to sell our retail software products 
we depend on distributors  retailers such as staples  compusa  office depot  and officemax  internet distributors and value added resellers  commonly known as vars  to market and distribute our retail software products 
our relationships with our distributors and retailers depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to meet certain minimum sales volume requirements 
in addition  with little or no advanced notice to us our retailers and vars may purchase fewer products from us in any given quarter for reasons beyond our control and in many cases unrelated to end user demand  such as a decision to change their inventory strategies 
our agreements with retailers and vars are not exclusive and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause 
if this happens or if we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with distributors and retailers to sell our retail software products  our retail sales will be adversely affected 
we may have excessive  unanticipated product returns 
we are exposed to the risk of product returns and markdown allowances with respect to our distributors and retailers 
we are generally not contractually obligated to accept returns  except for defective and damaged products 
however  we may permit customers to return or exchange product and may provide price protection on products unsold by a customer 
we consider return requests on a case by case basis  taking into consideration factors such as the products involved  the customer s historical sales volume and the customer s credit status 
in addition  we provide markdown allowances  which consist of credits given to customers to induce them to lower the retail sales price of certain products in an effort to increase sales to consumers and to help manage our customers inventory levels in the distribution channel 
although we maintain a reserve for returns and markdown allowances  and although we manage our returns and markdown allowances through our authorization procedure  we could choose to accept substantial product returns and provide markdown allowances to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels 
product returns and markdown allowances that exceed our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and diversion of management attention 
we have in the past made and we expect to continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make any additional acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operation  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
acquisitions may also subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition 
we may also have to incur debt or issue equity securities in order to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability will be affected because of acquisition related costs or amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have not or limited prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies with out existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisitions 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  general economic conditions and conditions within the communications software markets  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related and other high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
our products may contain undetected software errors 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected errors 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period it took to correct these errors 
although we and our oem customers test our products  it is possible that errors may be found in our new or existing products after we have commenced commercial shipment of those products 
these undetected errors could result in adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance of our products or claims against us by customers 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional money to fund our activities beyond the next year 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish right to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
our efforts to develop a market for our retail software products require substantial investments that may adversely affect our operating margins 
in order to strengthen recognition of and build distribution channels for our retail software products  including our new checkit r line of products  we have had to make significant investments in marketing and sales related to these products 
we expect to have to continue to incur these costs and perhaps even to increase them in the future 
accordingly  our retail sales may not provide us with the same contribution margin to operating income that we have historically achieved on our oem sales 
inability or delays in deliveries from our component suppliers could damage our reputation and could cause our net revenues to decline and harm our results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with the components for our product kits 
these components include cds and printed manuals 
we also rely on third parties for cd rom replication 
we do not have long term supply arrangements with any vendor to obtain these necessary components for our products 
if we are unable to purchase components from these suppliers or if the cd rom replication facilities that we use do not deliver our requirements on schedule  we may not be able to deliver products in a cd rom format to our customers on a timely basis or enter into new orders because of a shortage in components 
any delays that we experience in delivering our products to customers could impair our customer relationships and adversely impact our reputation and our business 
in addition  if our third party suppliers raise their prices for components or cd rom replication services  our gross margins would be reduced 
because we currently operate with little backlog  our revenues in each quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
we currently have backlog orders only in our internet solutions division for our consulting related sales and we only began building this backlog during the year ended december  in our other divisions  we operate with little backlog because we generally ship our software products as we receive orders and because our royalty revenue is based upon our customers actual usage in a given period 
accordingly  we recognize revenue shortly after orders are received or royalty reports are generated 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders that we book and ship in that quarter 
this makes it difficult for us to predict what our revenues and operating results will be in any quarter 
if orders in the first month or two of a quarter fall short of expectations  it is likely that we will not meet our revenue targets for that quarter 
if this happens  our quarterly operating results would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
our success is dependent upon our software code base  our programming methodologies and other intellectual properties and proprietary rights 
in order to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright and trademark law 
however  these measures afford us only limited protection 
we currently own united states trademark registrations for certain of our trademarks  but we have not yet obtained registrations for all of our trademarks in the united states or other countries 
in addition  prior to becoming a publicly held entity  we did not require our employees to sign proprietary information and inventions agreements stipulating to our software ownership rights 
we only recently started the patent application process for a number of technologies relating to our existing products and products under development 
furthermore  we rely primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
accordingly  despite the precautions we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain our rights without our authorization 
it is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of trademarks  patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights asserted by companies in our industry grows and the coverage of these patents and other rights and the functionality of software products increasingly overlap 
from time to time  we have received communications from third parties asserting that our trade name or features  content  or trademarks of certain of our products infringe upon intellectual property rights held by such third parties 
we have also received correspondence from third parties separately asserting that our fax products may infringe on certain patents held by each of the parties 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to our current or future products 
infringement claims  whether with or without merit  could result in time consuming and costly litigation  divert the attention of our management  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties 
if we are required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  they may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements could seriously impair our ability to market our products 
we must continue to hire and retain key personnel in an intensely competitive labor market 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and other key technical and consulting personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with our key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of our key employees would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing research and development required to develop and enhance our communication software products as well those in our highly specialized consulting business 
competition for these employees is intense and employee retention is a common problem in our industry 
our inability to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are essential to our product development  consulting services  marketing  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate revenue  develop new products or product enhancements and generally have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if internet usage fails to grow or declines  or if commerce conducted over the internet is not accepted by consumers and businesses  our future sales and future profits will decline 
if ecommerce does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  demand for our products and services will be reduced 
our products enhance companies abilities to transact business and conduct web based operations 
as a result  our future sales and any future profits are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by consumers and businesses 
to be successful we must rely on consumers and businesses who have not historically used the internet to transact business and exchange information 
consumers and businesses may reject the internet as a viable commercial medium for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate network infrastructure  slow development of enabling technologies  insufficient commercial support or privacy concerns 
the internet s infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by increased usage 
in addition  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or increased government regulation  could cause the internet to lose its viability as a commercial medium 
even if the required infrastructure  standards  protocols and complementary products  services or facilities are developed  we may incur substantial expenses adapting our solutions to changing or emerging technologies 
as our international business expands  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
approximately   and of our revenue for the years ended december   and was derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in the future  we intend to continue to expand these international business activities 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our officers and directors could control matters submitted to our stockholders 
as of march   william w 
smith jr  the president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of our company  and rhonda l 
smith  the secretary  treasurer and vice chairman of the board of our company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
william w 
smith jr 
and rhonda l 
smith are married to one another and  acting together  will have the ability to elect our directors and determine the outcome of any corporate action requiring stockholder approval  including a merger or business combination  irrespective of how you may vote 
this concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to buy our company  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock could cause the price of our shares to decline 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
of this amount  the  shares held by william w 
smith  jr 
and rhonda l 
smith became available for sale in the public market subject to the volume and other applicable restrictions of rule in september  following the expiration of a two year lock up agreement with certain representatives of the underwriters of our initial public offering  which consummated in september sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by william w 
smith  jr  rhonda l 
smith or any other person  either individually or when aggregated with sales by other persons  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could make a takeover of our company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for instance  our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of shares of any series of preferred stock  without action by our stockholders 
as a result  the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock  which could delay or prevent a change of control because the rights given to the holders of such preferred stock may prohibit a merger  reorganization  sale or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
in addition  we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and certain provisions of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
