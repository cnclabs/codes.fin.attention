the adoption of this statement or any transition adjustment will not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
inflation in the nine months ended december  and the years ended december  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company 
periods of high inflation could have an adverse effect to the extent that increased borrowing costs for floating rate debt may not be offset by increases in subscriber rates 
at december   after giving effect to interest rate hedging agreements  approximately  of the company s total debt was subject to floating interest rates 
regulatory and competitive matters the cable television operations of the company may be adversely affected by changes and developments in governmental regulation  competitive forces and technology 
the cable television industry and the company are subject to extensive regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
the cable act significantly expanded the scope of regulation of certain subscriber rates and a number of other matters in the cable industry  such as mandatory carriage of local broadcast stations and retransmission consent  and increased the administrative costs of complying with such regulations 
the fcc has adopted rate regulations that establish  on a system by system basis  maximum allowable rates for i basic programming services based upon a benchmark methodology  and ii associated equipment and installation services based upon cost plus a reasonable profit 
under the fcc rules  franchising authorities are authorized to regulate rates for basic services and associated equipment and installation services 
the act ended fcc regulation of cable programming service tier rates on march  rates for basic services are set pursuant to a benchmark formula 
alternatively  a cable operator may elect to use a cost of service methodology to show that rates for basic services are reasonable 
refunds with interest will be required to be paid by cable operators who are required to reduce regulated rates 
the fcc has reserved the right to reduce or increase the benchmarks it has established 
the rate regulations also limit increases in regulated rates to an inflation indexed amount plus increases in certain costs such as taxes  franchise fees  costs associated with specific franchise requirements and increased programming costs 
cost based adjustments to these capped rates can also be made in the event a cable operator adds or deletes channels or completes a significant system rebuild or upgrade 
because of the limitation on rate increases for regulated services  future revenue growth from cable services will rely to a much greater extent than has been true in the past on increased revenues from unregulated services and new subscribers than from increases in previously unregulated rates 
the fcc has adopted regulations implementing all of the requirements of the cable act 
the fcc is also likely to continue to modify  clarify or refine the rate regulations 
adelphia cannot predict the effect of future rulemaking proceedings or changes to the rate regulations 
cable television companies operate under franchises granted by local authorities  which are subject to renewal and renegotiation from time to time 
because such franchises are generally non exclusive  there is a potential for competition with the systems from other operators of cable television systems  including public systems operated by municipal franchising authorities themselves  and from other distribution systems capable of delivering television programming to homes 
the cable act and the act contain provisions which encourage competition from such other sources 
the company cannot predict the extent to which competition will materialize from other cable television operators  local telephone companies  other distribution systems for delivering television programming to the home  or other potential competitors  or  if such competition materializes  the extent of its effect on the company 
the act repealed the prohibition on clecs from providing video programming directly to customers within their local exchange areas other than in rural areas or by specific waiver of fcc rules 
the act also authorized clecs to operate open video systems ovs without obtaining a local cable franchise  although clecs operating such a system can be required to make payments to local governmental bodies in lieu of cable franchise fees 
where demand exceeds capacity  up to two thirds of the channels on an ovs must be available to programmers unaffiliated with the clec 
the statute states that the ovs scheme supplants the fcc s video dialtone rules 
the fcc has promulgated rules to implement the ovs concept 
the company believes that the provision of video programming by telephone companies in competition with the company s existing operations could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
at this time  the impact of any such effect is not known or estimable 
the company also competes with dbs service providers 
dbs has been available to consumers since a single dbs satellite can provide more than channels of programming 
dbs service can be received virtually anywhere in the united states through the installation of a small outdoor antenna 
dbs service is being heavily marketed on a nationwide basis by several service providers  some of which are now offering local programming channels 
at this time  any impact of dbs competition on the company s future results is not known or estimable
