it is management s policy to maintain an allowance for estimated losses based on the risk of loss in the loan portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
management classifies all delinquent assets as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
a reserve level is estimated by management for each category of classified loans  with an estimated percentage applied to the delinquent loan category balance 
in addition  management notes that there is an inherent risk of potential loan loss in the company s overall  non classified loan portfolio 
this inherent risk is addressed by applying an estimated potential loss to the remaining unclassified loan portfolio 
activity for the period under analysis is also taken into account charge offs  recoveries  provision 
while management has allocated the allowance to different loan categories  the allowance is general in nature and is available for the loan portfolio in its entirety

see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to income taxes 
asset and liability management the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during a given time period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income  and during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap within shorter maturities would have the opposite effect 
as of september   the amount of the company s interest bearing liabilities which were estimated to mature or reprice within one year exceeded the company s interest earning assets with the same characteristics by million or of the company s total assets 
the company s actions with respect to interest rate risk and its asset liability gap management are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee of the board of directors 
this committee meets at least quarterly to  among other things  set interest rate risk targets and review the company s current composition of assets and liabilities in light of the prevailing interest rate environment 
the committee assesses its interest rate risk strategy at the bank quarterly  which is reviewed by the full board of directors 
the company has historically emphasized the origination of long term fixed rate residential real estate loans for retention in its portfolio 
at september   million or of the company s total loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
however  as of such date  the company also held in its loan portfolio million of one  three and five year arms and million of long term residential mortgage loans which have interest rate adjustment features at seven years and fifteen years 
the company has attempted to mitigate the interest rate risk of holding a significant portion of fixed rate loans in its portfolio through the origination of the arms and short term construction and consumer loans 
at september   arms comprised million or of the total loan portfolio and construction  commercial and consumer loans aggregated million or of the total loan portfolio 
at september   million or of the company s total assets consisted of investment securities  of which have terms to maturity of less than five years 
in addition  the company has invested in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
at september   million or of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio was comprised of arms 
at september   the company classified million or of its investment and mortgage backed securities portfolios as available for sale  which permits the company to sell such securities if deemed appropriate in response to  among other things  changes in interest rates 
management presently monitors and evaluates the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the level of net interest income and the economic value of the company s equity eve on a monthly basis 
eve is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the company focuses on the impact of a plus and minus basis point immediate interest rate shock on its net interest income 
the company utilizes the sendero system for its in house modeling efforts and also works with an outside banking consultant in modeling its interest rate risk position 
the following table presents the company s eve as of september  economic value of portfolio equity change in estimated eve interest rates as a percentage amount of basis points estimated eve of assets change percent dollars in thousands the following table presents the company s eve as of september  economic value of portfolio equity change in estimated eve interest rates as a percentage amount of basis points estimated eve of assets change percent dollars in thousands as noted on the previous tables  significant increases or decreases in interest rates may adversely affect the company s net interest income and or eve because of the excess of interest bearing liabilities over interest earning assets repricing within shorter periods and because the company s adjustable rate  interest earning assets generally are not as responsive to changes in interest rates as its interest bearing liabilities due to terms which generally permit only annual adjustments to the interest rate and which generally limit the amount which interest rates can adjust at such time and over the life of the related asset 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans and assets in the company s loan and investment portfolio could decrease in future periods if market rates of interest remain at or decrease below current levels 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  advances from the fhlb  repayments  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the movement of interest rates in general  economic conditions and competition 
the company manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a deposit balance deemed appropriate and desirable 
in addition  the company invests in short term investment securities and interest earning assets which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
although the company s deposits have historically represented the majority of its total liabilities  the company also utilizes other borrowing sources  primarily advances from the fhlb 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as cash and cash equivalents  and us government agency securities 
on a longer term basis  the company invests in various loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities 
the company uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments to pay maturing savings certificates and savings withdrawals  fund loan commitments and maintain an investment securities portfolio 
at september   the total approved loan commitments outstanding excluding undisbursed portions of loans in process amounted to million 
at the same date  the unadvanced portion of loans in process approximated million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at september  totaled million 
management of the company believes that the company has adequate resources  including principal prepayments and repayments of loans and maturing investments  to fund all of its commitments to the extent required 
based upon its historical run off experience  management believes that a significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with the company 
as of september   the company had regulatory capital which was in excess of applicable limits

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels
