item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the company included elsewhere herein as well as the other portions of this report on form k 
in particular  the reader should review uncertainty of forward looking statements and information found on page of this report on form k for information regarding forward looking statements made in this discussion and certain risks inherent in the company s business 
other risks involved in the company s business are discussed under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk beginning on page of this report 
current business environment during most of  the us ngl industry benefited from a steady demand for ngls  petroleum liquids and mtbe as a result of the strong us economy and firm international demand 
overall  the company enjoyed outstanding earnings in in all of its business segments despite the tighter processing margins encountered late in the fourth quarter 
the company s solid performance in is the result of an integrated ngl system that allows the company to extract margins through its access to multiple supplies and markets 
the near term enthusiasm of the us ngl industry was somewhat dampened at the end of last year as the cost of natural gas which is the most significant variable operating expense of most facilities soared to all time record levels in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of natural gas prices increased from an average of mmbtu in the first quarter of to mmbtu in the fourth quarter of with december being the highest of the year at mmbtu 
in january  the price of natural gas reached record levels of approximately mmbtu or per barrel on a crude oil equivalent 
generally  as the cost of natural gas increases  certain facilities may become too expensive to operate and are consequently shutdown temporarily 
in the case of a natural gas processing plant  high natural gas prices may result in the cost of fuel and shrinkage exceeding the value of the ngls extracted leading either to shutdown of the facility or to operate at decreased extraction rates ie  to operate in rejection mode 
because the company has an integrated ngl system  the company s natural gas processing plants continued to operate at high levels during the fourth quarter of when many of its competitors were in rejection mode or shutdown 
in december  the company maintained an equity ngl production rate of mbpd  or about of the full ngl extraction rate 
at the beginning of january  with natural gas prices climbing to near mmbtu  it finally became uneconomic to run the company s natural gas processing facilities at these high extraction rates 
as a result of minimal or no ngl extraction  natural gas volumes downstream of the processing plants became higher in ngl content than allowed by pipeline specifications 
the natural gas pipeline operators responded by issuing operational flow orders that threatened to shut in some of the rich natural gas from the deepwater developments unless the ngl content of these natural gas streams was reduced to lower levels 
in order to meet the specifications of the natural gas pipeline operators  the company and producers negotiated interim reductions in fuel and shrinkage costs to levels that were significantly below the prevailing cost of natural gas 
with these interim provisions in place  the company s gas processing plants increased ngl extraction rates with the objective to lower the ngl content of the natural gas to a level satisfactory to the pipeline operators 
as natural gas prices increased to unprecedented levels in january  refiners switched to burning propane as fuel and sold their natural gas into the spot markets 
in late december and january  petrochemical demand softened as petrochemical companies elected to deplete their ngl raw material inventories and their finished product inventories of ethylene and propylene and optimized their ethylene production from cracking naptha 
management believes that the petrochemical companies can take this position for only a short time and these companies will return to the ngl marketplace to purchase ethane later in the first quarter of due to their needs for greater ethylene production 
as a result of reduced supplies of ngls from gas processing facilities and refineries in december and extending into the first quarter of  us gulf coast fractionation and pipeline volumes including those at the company s facilities declined 
this situation  however  also created regional shortages of ngls  especially propane  which resulted in large regional pricing differences 
this provided the company with opportunities to serve these supply short markets through the sale of inventory by its processing merchant business 
management believes that the gas processing business will have a challenging first quarter of the current processing environment does  however  present opportunities to take advantage of the company s integrated ngl system 
looking back over the last year  the company s ngl production has significantly increased over levels as a result of steadily growing levels of natural gas production available for processing  higher ngl content natural gas and new processing facilities such as the company s neptune plant 
neptune commenced operations in february and added approximately mbpd of equity ngl production for the year 
for  equity ngl production averaged mbpd versus mbpd in management believes that the company s equity ngl production volumes will continue to increase in as a result of gas production from several new gulf of mexico gas fields scheduled to come on line in which the company holds gas processing rights  the most significant of which is shell s deepwater brutus development with an expected equity ngl production of mbpd by the end of 
management s belief is based in part on the premise that natural gas prices will continue to moderate over the coming months see first quarter natural gas prices in the table on page  however  if fuel costs return to the record levels seen in january  equity ngl production rates may actually decline in the highly competitive environment in which the company s mont belvieu ngl fractionators operate has continued to suppress ngl fractionation fees at these facilities 
the company has and is continuing to aggressively acquire new and reacquire previous ngl fractionation customers  along with offering competitively priced bundled service packages involving transportation  fractionation and other services 
these service packages allow the company to take advantage of its presence throughout the entire gulf coast ngl value chain 
as a result of these efforts  gross processing volumes at the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility increased to mbpd in from mbpd in with the completion of the lou tex ngl pipeline in the fourth quarter of  the company is positioned to fully utilize its mont belvieu ngl fractionation facilities to process ngl s from louisiana starting in the first quarter of in january  the company announced that it had entered into a long term agreement to exchange ngls produced at the sea robin natural gas processing plant in vermilion parish  louisiana  for finished ngl products at mont belvieu using the lou tex ngl pipeline 
initial gross processing volumes are expected to be mbpd and are forecast to increase to over mbpd by the end of the demand for commercial isomerization services depends upon the industry s requirements for i isobutane in excess of naturally occurring isobutane produced from ngl fractionation and refinery operations and ii high purity isobutane 
the market for the company s services was firm throughout most of due to the continued need for isobutane for alkylation and the production of propylene oxide and mtbe 
as part of its commercial isomerization business  the company produces the high purity isobutane used in the production of mtbe at the bef facility 
isobutane demand from the bef facility was temporarily curtailed due to a maintenance outage at the mtbe plant that began in early december with the startup of the bef plant in mid february  management anticipates that the demand for its commercial isomerization services will return to normal levels 
during the third quarter of  the rapid price increase for propylene experienced during the first half of began to reverse 
during the first half  propylene prices were driven by the dramatic increases in crude oil and ngl prices 
these factors contributed to similar increases in the cost for ethylene and propylene from steam crackers and for refinery grade propylene produced by refineries 
in addition  the price spike in motor gasoline  natural gas and propane created a very competitive market for refinery grade propylene which is used in the production of alkylate which is blended into motor gasoline  substituted for natural gas as refinery fuel and blended into propane streams for the fuels market 
with the perceived stabilization and softening in crude oil and natural gas prices  propylene buyers have been successful in achieving price reductions by reducing purchases and consuming inventory 
contract prices for polymer grade propylene increased from approximately cents per pound at the beginning of to cents per pound by the end of june 
by the end of december  the contract price had slipped to cents per pound 
management anticipates that prices will continue to soften in early with the price leveling out to that seen at the beginning of the company is exposed to these price decreases only to the extent that it sells product pursuant to long term agreements having market based pricing or transactions on the spot market see page for a discussion of propylene merchant business contracts 
during  the favorable domestic economy supported strong demand for the company s pipeline transportation services as ngl feedstocks and products were consumed at record levels throughout the gulf coast region 
the company s pipeline volumes increased significantly to mbpd in from mbpd in primarily due to volumes attributable to the assets acquired in the tngl acquisition  the purchase of the lou tex propylene pipeline in march and the completion of the lou tex ngl pipeline in november as noted above  pipeline volumes weakened as ngl production from gas processing facilities decreased in late and january in reaction to the high natural gas prices 
this trend began to reverse itself in february as natural gas prices declined and processing volumes at the company s gas processing facilities increased 
the company anticipates using the lou tex ngl pipeline to provide transportation services for ngl products and mixed propane propylene streams between the louisiana and texas markets in addition to transporting ngl production from louisiana gas processing facilities to mont belvieu for fractionation 
management believes that the company s pipeline system and storage assets in the louisiana to mont belvieu  texas corridor and its import export terminal on the houston ship channel provide the company with the infrastructure for continued success in the ngl marketplace 
during the second quarter of  bef s mtbe operations classified under the octane enhancement business segment benefited from higher crude oil prices as well as a tight international mtbe supply environment 
due to contractual arrangements  bef began selling its mtbe at market related prices in april at a time when mtbe market prices were increasing significantly due to their indirect link to crude oil prices which were on the increase  mtbe supply imbalances between europe and the united states due to the temporary diversion of middle east mtbe production to europe and domestic gasoline refining demand in anticipation of the normal summer driving season 
the combination of these external factors resulted in the market price for mtbe increasing to near record levels in the second quarter of peaking at an average per gallon in june 
during the third quarter  mtbe market prices deflated rapidly as imports returned to the domestic market and as gasoline refiners trimmed oxygenate usage due to the end of the summer driving season and depleted mtbe inventories in anticipation of falling crude oil prices 
by october  mtbe prices had hit a low of per gallon 
as mtbe prices weakened during the latter half of  feedstock costs began to increase primarily due to the rise in natural gas prices mentioned previously resulting in negative operating margins 
in order to reduce its exposure to negative margins  bef management elected to reschedule routine annual maintenance activities that had been originally planned for the spring of to be performed during december and january the facility restarted operations in mid february with the return of positive operating margins 
management anticipates that mtbe prices will strengthen in the next few months as refiners begin purchasing mtbe in preparation of gasoline blending requirements for the upcoming summer driving season

recent acquisitions acquisitions 
the company completed two acquisitions during the third quarter of effective august   the company acquired tngl from shell  in exchange for million non distribution bearing  convertible special partnership units of the company and million in cash 
the company also agreed to issue up to million additional non distribution bearing special partnership units to shell in the future if the volumes of natural gas that the company processes for shell reach agreed upon levels in and the first million of these additional special partnership units were issued on august  the tngl businesses acquired include natural gas processing and ngl fractionation  transportation and storage in louisiana and mississippi and its ngl supply and merchant business 
tngl has varying interests in eleven natural gas processing plants  four ngl fractionation facilities  four ngl storage facilities  approximately  miles of pipelines and is party to the shell processing agreement  a year natural gas processing agreement 
the company accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method 
the purchase price allocation for the year natural gas processing agreement classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet was a net million and million at december  and  respectively 
during  the asset s recorded value was increased to reflect the million additional special partnership units issued to shell on august   purchase accounting adjustments and related amortization 
effective july   the company acquired an additional interest in the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility from kinder morgan for a purchase price of million in cash and the assumption of million in debt 
an additional interest in the same facility was purchased from epco for million in cash 
this acquisition referred to as the mba acquisition increased the company s effective interest in the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility from to 
as a result of this acquisition  the results of operations after july  were consolidated rather than included in equity income from unconsolidated affiliates 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include five month s impact of the tngl businesses acquired from shell and six month s impact of the additional ownership interest in the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility acquired from kinder morgan and epco 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for selected pro forma financial data reflecting these transactions as if they had occurred on january  and acquisitions 
the company has recently announced and or completed the acquisition of three louisiana based natural gas pipeline systems acadian gas  llc acadian  stingray pipeline company  llc stingray and west cameron dehydration  llc west cameron  and sailfish pipeline company  llc sailfish and moray pipeline company  llc moray 
the acquisition of these natural gas pipeline systems represents a strategic investment for the company and allows for entry into the natural gas gathering  transportation  marketing and storage business 
management believes that these assets have attractive growth attributes given the expected long term increase in natural gas demand for industrial and power generation uses 
in addition  these assets extend the company s midstream energy service relationship with long term ngl customers producers  petrochemical suppliers and refineries and offer additional fee based cash flows and opportunities for enhanced services to customers 
acadian 
on september   the company announced that it had executed a definitive agreement to purchase acadian from coral energy  an affiliate of shell  for million in cash  inclusive of working capital 
the acquisition of acadian integrates its natural gas pipeline systems in south louisiana with the company s gulf coast natural gas processing and ngl fractionation  pipeline and storage system 
the acadian acquisition gives the company an extensive intrastate natural gas pipeline system with access to both supply and markets  positions the company to compete for incremental natural gas supplies from new discoveries onshore  the offshore louisiana continental shelf and gulf of mexico deepwater developments  enables the company to take advantage of growing industrial and petrochemical demand including new gas fired power generation projects along with additional natural gas processing opportunities 
acadian s assets are comprised of the mile acadian  mile cypress and mile evangeline natural gas pipeline systems  which together have over one billion cubic feet bcf per day of capacity 
these natural gas pipeline systems are wholly owned by acadian with the exception of the evangeline system in which acadian holds an approximate economic interest 
the system includes a leased natural gas storage facility at napoleonville  louisiana 
completion of this transaction is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals 
the purchase is expected to be completed during the first quarter of stingray  west cameron  sailfish and moray collectively  the el paso acquisition 
on january   the company announced that it had completed the purchase of of the membership interests of stingray and west cameron  together with some offshore lateral pipelines for approximately million in cash from affiliates of el paso energy partners lp epe and coastal corp 
shell purchased the remaining membership interests of both stingray and west cameron for an equal amount of cash 
in addition  the company purchased from epe of the membership interests of sailfish and moray for approximately million in cash 
collectively  the company acquired interests in five natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in the gulf of mexico totaling approximately miles of pipeline with an aggregate gross capacity of bcfd 
these pipelines and their associated assets are strategically located to serve continental shelf and deepwater developments in the central gulf of mexico 
as with the acadian acquisition  the el paso acquisition broadens the company s midstream business by providing additional services to customers  and it benefits from increased natural gas production from deepwater gulf of mexico development 
management believes that the assets acquired from epe complement and integrate well with those of the acadian acquisition 
stingray owns a mile ferc regulated two phase natural gas pipeline system that transports natural gas and injected condensate from the high island  west cameron  east cameron  vermillion and garden banks areas in the gulf of mexico to onshore transmission systems at holly beach and cameron parish  louisiana 
west cameron is an unregulated dehydration facility located at and connected to the onshore terminal of stingray 
shell is the operator of the stingray and west cameron facilities 
sailfish owns a interest in manta ray offshore gathering company  llc manta ray and nautilus pipeline company  llc nautilus 
moray owns a interest in the nemo gathering company  llc nemo 
manta ray which is jointly owned by sailfish  shell and marathon gas transmission company inc owns miles of unregulated natural gas transmission lines primarily located on the outer continental shelf offshore louisiana 
nautilus which is owned by sailfish  shell and marathon gas transmission company inc owns miles of ferc regulated natural gas pipelines and related facilities extending from points offshore louisiana to interconnecting pipelines near the garden city and neptune gas processing facilities 
nemo which is jointly owned by moray and shell is a development stage enterprise that is constructing and will operate an offshore louisiana natural gas gathering pipeline and related facilities that will connect certain shell offshore platform assets to manta ray 
management believes that these assets have a significant upside potential  since shell and marathon have dedicated production from over  square miles of offshore natural gas leases to these systems and only a small portion of this total has been developed to date 
shell is the operator of the manta ray  nautilus and nemo systems 
equistar storage facility 
in addition to the natural gas pipeline acquisitions  the company announced on february  that it had acquired a ngl storage facility from equistar chemicals  lp for approximately million 
the salt dome storage cavern  which is located near the company s mont belvieu  texas complex  has a capacity of one million barrels 
the purchase also includes adjacent acreage which would support the development of additional storage capacity 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues  costs and expenses and operating income 
the company s revenues increased to  million in compared to  million in the company s operating costs and expenses increased by to  million in versus  million in operating income increased to million in from million in the principal factors behind the increase in operating income were a the improvement in ngl product prices in versus and b the additional margins associated with the businesses acquired in the tngl acquisition 
the period includes five months of margins associated with the tngl operations whereas the period includes twelve months 
fractionation 
the company s gross operating margin for the fractionation segment increased to million in from million in during  ngl fractionation margin increased million over as a result of additional margins from the four ngl fractionators acquired from shell in the tngl acquisition promix  tebone  venice and norco ngl fractionators 
as noted previously  the period includes only five months of margin from these fractionators whereas the period includes twelve months 
in addition  equity income from brf reflects twelve months of operations in versus six months in brf commenced operations in july net ngl fractionation volumes increased from mbpd in to mbpd in primarily due to the company s acquisition of new and previous customers at its mont belvieu ngl fractionator in and the increased ownership of the mont belvieu ngl fractionator as a result of the mba acquisition 
for  gross operating margin from the isomerization business decreased million compared to primarily due to higher fuel and other operating costs and charges related to the refurbishment of an isomerization unit 
isomerization volumes were mbpd in both and due to strong demand for the company s services 
gross operating margin from propylene fractionation decreased million for compared to primarily due to higher energy costs 
net volumes at these facilities improved to mbpd in versus mbpd in due to the startup of the brpc propylene concentrator in july pipeline 
the company s gross operating margin for the pipeline segment was million in compared to million in overall volumes increased to mbpd in from mbpd in generally  the million increase in margin is attributable to the additional volumes and margins contributed by the tngl pipeline and storage assets  higher margins from the houston ship channel distribution system and epik due to an increase in export volumes  the margins from the lou tex propylene pipeline that was purchased in march and margins from the lou tex ngl pipeline which commenced operations in late november the growth in export volumes is attributable to the installation of epik s new chiller unit that began operations in the fourth quarter of on february   the purchase of the lou tex propylene pipeline and related assets from concha chemical pipeline company  an affiliate of shell  was completed at a cost of approximately million 
the effective date of the transaction was march  the lou tex propylene pipeline is a mile  pipeline that transports chemical grade propylene from sorrento  louisiana to mont belvieu  texas 
also acquired in this transaction was a mile ethane pipeline between sorrento and norco  louisiana and a million barrel storage cavern at sorrento  louisiana 
the lou tex ngl pipeline system consists of a recently completed mile ngl pipeline used i to provide transportation services for ngl products and refinery grade propylene between the louisiana and texas markets and ii to transport mixed ngls from the company s louisiana gas processing facilities to the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility 
construction of this system was completed during the fourth quarter of at a cost of approximately million 
processing 
the company s gross operating margin for processing was million in compared to million in due to the tngl acquisition  the margin includes only five months of gas processing operations whereas the period includes twelve months 
this segment benefited from a stronger ngl pricing environment in versus and a rise in equity ngl production from mbpd in to mbpd in octane enhancement 
the company s gross operating margin for octane enhancement increased to million in from million in this segment consists entirely of the company s equity earnings from its investment in bef  a joint venture facility that currently produces mtbe 
the results include the impact of the company s million pro rata share of a non cash write off of bef s unamortized balance of deferred start up costs 
the results reflect the impact of higher than normal mtbe market prices during the second quarter and early third quarter and lower debt service costs 
bef made its final note payment in may and now owns the mtbe facility debt free 
the mtbe facility was temporarily shutdown in early december for maintenance 
the facility restarted operations in mid february mtbe production  on a net basis  was mbpd in both and other 
the company s gross operating margin for the other segment was million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to fee based marketing services added in the fourth quarter of apart from this portion of the segment s operations  the gross margin contribution of the other aspects of this segment were insignificant in both and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million during the higher costs result from an increase in the administrative services fee charged by epco to an average million per month in versus the approximately million per month charged in the remainder of the increase is attributable to the additional staff and resources deemed necessary to support the company s ongoing expansion activities resulting from acquisitions and other business development 
interest expense 
the company s interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to a rise in average debt levels to million in from million in debt levels have increased over the last year primarily due to capital expenditures for assets such as the lou tex propylene pipeline and lou tex ngl pipeline 
loss on sale of assets 
during the second quarter of  the company recognized a one time million non cash charge on the sale of its longview terminal to huntsman corporation 
the longview terminal was part of the pipelines segment and was used to unload polymer grade propylene from ngl tank trucks 
dividend income from unconsolidated affiliates 
the company received million in cash distributions from its cost method investment in vesco during during  the company recorded dividend income from dixie and vesco in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
in october  the company purchased an additional interest in dixie resulting in a retroactive change in accounting for this investment from the cost method to the equity method see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the dixie investment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues  costs and expenses and operating income 
the company s revenues increased to  million in compared to million in the company s operating costs and expenses increased by to  million in versus million in operating income increased to million in from million in the principal factor behind the increase in operating income was the tngl acquisition 
earnings attributable to these assets from the date of acquisition  august   through december  added approximately million in gross operating margin to the company s financial performance 
the other primary source of the increase was an overall improvement in ngl product prices in compared to levels 
fractionation 
the company s gross operating margin for the fractionation segment increased to million in from million in ngl fractionation margin increased million over as a result of additional margins from the four tngl fractionators 
as noted previously  the period includes five months of margin from these ngl fractionators whereas the period includes none 
in addition  the period reflects six months of increased ownership of the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility resulting from the mba acquisition and six months of equity income from brf which commenced operations in july net ngl fractionation volumes increased from mbpd in to mbpd primarily due to the tngl fractionators and increased ownership of the mont belvieu ngl fractionator 
during  gross operating margin from isomerization increased million compared to levels due to exceptional pricing conditions in the first half of and higher overall production 
isomerization volumes increased from mbpd in to mbpd in gross operating margin from propylene fractionation increased million over levels generally due to increases in polymer grade propylene prices and higher production rates 
volumes at these facilities improved to mbpd in versus mbpd in pipeline 
the company s gross operating margin for the pipeline segment increased million compared to overall volumes increased to mbpd in from mbpd in of the increase in both margin and volumes  million in margin and approximately mbpd in throughput volumes are attributable to the tngl pipeline and related assets 
in addition  equity income from epik increased million due to increased export volumes 
margins from the company s houston ship channel import terminal and pipeline distribution system decreased million in primarily due to lower import volumes 
processing 
the company s gross operating margin for processing increased million over results 
the increase is primarily due to the gas processing operations acquired from tngl effective august  the gas processing operations benefited from a favorable ngl pricing environment during the fourth quarter of and mbpd of equity ngl production 
octane enhancement 
the company s gross operating margin for octane enhancement decreased million from levels 
the decrease is attributable to a million non cash charge by bef in january of which the company s share was million 
mtbe net production volumes averaged mbpd in both and other 
the company s gross operating margin for the other segment increased over levels 
the increase is attributable to the fee based marketing business acquired from tngl 
apart from this portion of the segment s operations  the gross margin contribution of the other aspects of this segment were insignificant in both and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses decreased by million compared to the expenses were lower due to the fixed administrative fees charged to the company under the epco agreement 
the fixed administrative service fees partially reimburse epco for the cost of providing certain management and administrative support for the company 
during  these fixed fees ranged from million to million per month 
the audit and conflicts committee of the general partner is responsible for reviewing and approving any increases in the standard administrative fees chargeable by epco to the company 
for additional information regarding the epco agreement  see page of this form k 
interest expense 
the company s interest expense increased over primarily due to the amortization of loan origination costs 
average debt levels in were generally consistent with those of dividend income from unconsolidated affiliates 
as a result of the tngl acquisition  the company owned cost method investments in dixie and vesco 
as such  the company recorded dividend income from these investments as cash dividends were received 
during  the company recorded dividend income from dixie and vesco in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
extraordinary charge on early extinguishment of debt 
the company incurred a million extraordinary loss during the third quarter of in connection with the early extinguishment of debt assumed from epco in connection with the company s initial public offering 
the extraordinary loss was equal to the remaining unamortized debt origination costs associated with such debt and make whole premiums payable in connection with the repayment of such debt 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for capital expenditures both maintenance and expansion related  business acquisitions  distributions to the partners and debt service 
the company expects to fund its short term needs for such items as maintenance capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to the partners from operating cash flows 
capital expenditures for long term needs resulting from future expansion projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources including either separately or in combination cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of additional common units and public debt 
the company s debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows or refinancing arrangements 
as noted above  certain of the company s liquidity and capital resource requirements are met using borrowings under bank credit facilities and or the issuance of additional common units or public debt separately or in combination 
as of december   availability under the company s bank credit facilities was million which may be increased to million under certain conditions 
in addition to the existing bank credit facilities  the company issued million of public debt in january using the remaining shelf availability under its million december universal shelf registration the december registration statement 
the proceeds from this offering were or will be used to acquire the acadian and epe natural gas pipeline systems for million and to finance the cost to construct certain ngl pipelines and related projects and for working capital and other general partnership purposes 
million of shelf availability under the december registration statement was used in march with the issuance of the million senior notes 
on february   the company filed a million universal shelf registration the february registration statement covering the issuance of an unspecified amount of equity or debt securities or a combination thereof 
for a broader discussion of the company s outstanding debt and changes therein  see the section below labeled long term debt 
in june  the company received approval from its unitholders to increase by  the number of common units available and unreserved to the company for general partnership purposes during the subordination period 
this increase has improved the future financial flexibility of the company in any potential business acquisition see amendment to partnership agreement below for further details 
if deemed necessary  management believes that additional financing arrangements can be obtained at reasonable terms 
management believes that maintenance of the company s investment grade credit ratings currently  baa by moody s investor service and bbb by standard and poors combined with a continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate its businesses efficiently are a solid foundation to providing the company with ample resources to meet its long and short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
operating  investing and financing cash flows for years ended december  and cash flows from operating activities were a million inflow in compared to a million inflow in cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect the effects of net income  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary items  equity income and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates and changes in working capital 
net income increased significantly in over due to reasons mentioned previously under results of operation of the company 
depreciation and amortization expense increased a combined million in over primarily the result of additional capital expenditures and acquisitions 
of the million increase  million is attributable to increases in amortization expense associated with the year shell natural gas processing agreement  excess cost related to past acquisitions and loan origination and bond issue costs 
the company received million in distributions from its equity method investments in compared to million in of the million increase in distributions  million was from bef and million from epik 
distributions from bef improved period to period due to the strong mtbe prices and margins during the second quarter of epik s distributions increased as a result of higher export activity during in addition  included million in cash receipts from promix which was acquired as a result of the tngl acquisition 
the net effect of changes in operating accounts from year to year is generally the result of timing of ngl sales and purchases near the end of the period 
cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in cash outflows included capital expenditures of million in versus million in capital expenditures in include million for the purchase of the lou tex propylene pipeline and related assets and million in construction costs for the lou tex ngl pipeline 
in addition  capital expenditures include maintenance capital project costs of million in and million in the period reflects million in net cash payments resulting from the tngl and mba acquisitions 
in  the company received million in payments from its participation in the bef note that was purchased during with the proceeds from the company s ipo 
bef made its final note payment in may with bef s final payment  the company s receivable relating to its participation in the bef note was extinguished 
investing cash outflows in include million in advances to and investments in unconsolidated affiliates compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the completion of the brf facility and the tri states and wilprise pipeline systems in on march   the company s offer of february  to buy the remaining ownership interests in dixie from the other seven owners expired  with no interest being purchased 
in october  the company announced that a wholly owned subsidiary had purchased an additional  shares of common stock of dixie from conoco pipe line company for approximately million 
the purchase increased the company s economic interest in dixie to approximately

recent accounting developments effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  will be required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recorded as a component of partners equity entitled other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is required to be recorded in earnings 
sfas defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge will be recorded at fair value through earnings 
the company expects that at january   it will record a million loss in other comprehensive income as a cumulative transition adjustment for derivatives commodity contracts designated in cash flow type hedges prior to adopting sfas in addition  the company expects to record a million derivative asset and a corresponding increase to its long term debt relating to derivatives interest rate swaps designated in fair value type hedges prior to adopting sfas the fair value hedges will have no impact to earnings upon transition 
the company will reclassify from other comprehensive income million as a charge to earnings during the first quarter of and million as a charge to earnings during the remainder of the actual gain or loss amount to be recognized in earnings related to these commodity contracts over time is dependent upon the final settlement price associated with the commodity prices 
amendment to partnership agreement the partnership agreement generally authorizes the company to issue an unlimited number of additional limited partner interests and other equity securities for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be established by the general partner in its sole discretion without the approval of the unitholders 
during the subordination period  however  the company is limited with regards to the number of equity securities that it may issue that rank senior to common units except for common units upon conversion of subordinated units  pursuant to employee benefit plans  upon conversion of the general partner interest as a result of the withdrawal of the general partner or in connection with acquisitions or capital improvements that are accretive on a per unit basis or an equivalent number of securities ranking on a parity with the common units  without the approval of the holders of at least a unit majority 
a unit majority is defined as at least a majority of the outstanding common units during the subordination period  excluding common units held by the general partner and its affiliates  and at least a majority of the outstanding common units after the subordination period 
in april  the company mailed a proxy statement to its public unitholders asking them to consider and vote for a proposal to amend the partnership agreement to increase the number of additional common units that may be issued during the subordination period without the approval of a unit majority from  common units to  common units 
the primary purpose of the requested increase was to improve the future financial flexibility of the company since  common units of the  common units available to the partnership during the subordination period were reserved for issuance in connection with the tngl acquisition 
at a special meeting of the unitholders and general partner held on june   this proposal was approved by of the public unitholders 
the amendment increases the number of common units available and unreserved to the company for general partnership purposes during the subordination period from  to  mtbe facility the company owns a interest in the bef partnership that owns the mtbe production facility located within the company s mont belvieu complex 
the production of mtbe is driven by oxygenated fuels programs enacted under the federal clean air amendments of and other legislation 
any changes to these programs that enable localities to elect to not participate in these programs  lessen the requirements for oxygenates or favor the use of non isobutane based oxygenated fuels would reduce the demand for mtbe 
on march   the governor of california ordered the phase out of mtbe in california by the end of due to allegations by several public advocacy and protest groups that mtbe contaminates water supplies  causes health problems and has not been as beneficial in reducing air pollution as originally contemplated 
in addition  legislation to amend the federal clean air act has been introduced in the us house of representatives to ban the use of mtbe as a fuel additive within three years 
legislation introduced in the us senate would eliminate the clean air act s oxygenate requirement in order to foster the elimination of mtbe in fuel 
no assurance can be given as to whether this or similar legislation ultimately will be adopted or whether the us congress or the epa might take steps to override the mtbe ban in california 
in light of the regulatory climate  the owners of bef are formulating a contingency plan for use of the bef facility if mtbe were banned or significantly curtailed 
the owners of bef are exploring a possible conversion of the bef facility from mtbe production to alkylate production 
one conversion alternative is expected to result in similar operating margin as that currently anticipated from the facility if it were to remain in mtbe service 
if this approach were taken  the cost to convert the facility would range from million to million  with the company s share being million to million 
a second conversion alternative would increase both production capacity and overall margin and cost between million and million  with the company s share being million to million 
management anticipates that if mtbe is banned alkylate demand will rise as producers use it to replace mtbe as an octane enhancer 
greater alkylate production would be expected to increase isobutane consumption nationwide and result in improved isomerization margins for the company 
sun  the mtbe facility s major customer and one of the partners of bef  has entered into a contract with bef to take all of the mtbe production through september item a

interest rate risk variable rate debt 
at december  and  the company had no derivative instruments in place to cover any potential interest rate risk on its variable rate debt obligations 
variable rate debt obligations expose the company to possible increases in interest expense and decreases in earnings if interest rates were to rise 
during and  the company s had variable rate long term debt outstanding under the million  million and million day bank credit facilities 
at december   the company had no variable rate debt outstanding 
if the weighted average base interest rates selected on the variable rate long term debt during were to have been higher than the weighted average of the actual base interest rates selected  assuming no changes in weighted average variable debt levels  interest expense would have increased by approximately million with a corresponding decrease in earnings before minority interest 
if the same calculation were performed on the variable rate long term debt outstanding during  interest expense would have increased by approximately million with a corresponding decrease in earnings before minority interest 
fixed rate debt 
in march  the company entered into interest rate swaps whereby the fixed rate of interest on a portion of the million senior notes and the million mbfc loan was effectively swapped for floating rates tied to the six month london interbank offering rate libor 
interest rate swaps are used to manage the company s overall costs of financing 
an interest rate swap  in general  requires one party to pay a fixed rate on the notional amount while the other party pays a floating rate based on the notional amount 
to maintain a balance between variable rate and fixed rate exposure  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million by which the company receives payments based on a fixed rate and pays an amount based on a floating rate 
at december   the company s consolidated debt portfolio interest rate exposure was fixed and floating  after considering the effect of the interest rate swap agreements 
the notional amount does not represent exposure to credit loss 
the company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties 
management believes the risk of incurring a credit related loss is remote  and that if incurred  such losses would be immaterial

in each case  the counterparty has the option to terminate the interest rate swap on the early termination date 
in each case  the company is the floating rate payor 
the floating rate was the rate in effect as of december  swap was terminated by the bank effective march  if the six month libor rates applicable to the notional amounts of these interest rate swap agreements during were to have been higher than the six month libor rates actually used in the swap agreements  assuming no changes in fixed rate debt levels  interest expense for would have increased by million  with a corresponding decrease in earnings before minority interest 
in connection with the implementation of sfas  the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded on the balance sheet as a million receivable with an offsetting gain recorded in earnings on january  the value recorded for the interest rate swap agreements represents the fair value of these derivative instruments using current market interest rates 
in accordance with sfas  the value of the interest rate swaps will be redetermined each reporting period based upon then current market interest rates 
the value assigned to the interest rate swap agreements is predicated upon the expected life of the swap agreements as influenced by current market interest rates 
the change in the value of these instruments during each measurement period will result in either an increase or a decrease in earnings 
at december   the company s fixed rate debt obligations aggregated million and had a fair value of million 
since these instruments have fixed interest rates  they do not expose the company to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase to approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity

all cash equivalent investments other than cash are highly liquid  have original maturities of less than three months  and are considered to have insignificant interest rate risk

in order to effectively manage this risk  the company may enter into swaps  forwards  commodity futures  options and other derivative commodity instruments with similar characteristics that are permitted by contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with another financial instrument 
the purpose of these risk management activities is to hedge exposure to price risks associated with natural gas  ngl production and inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values arising from immediate selected potential changes in the quoted market prices of derivative commodity instruments outstanding at the dates noted within the table
