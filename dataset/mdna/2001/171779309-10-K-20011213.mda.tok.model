item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview ciena is a leader in the intelligent optical networking equipment market 
we offer a portfolio of products for communications service providers worldwide 
our customers include long distance carriers  competitive and incumbent local exchange carriers  internet service providers  wireless and wholesale carriers 
ciena offers optical transport and intelligent optical switching systems that enable service providers to provision  manage and deliver high bandwidth services to their customers 
we have pursued a strategy to develop and leverage the power of disruptive technologies to change the fundamental economics of building carrier class tele and data communications networks  thereby providing our customers with a competitive advantage 
ciena s intelligent optical networking products are designed to enable carriers to deliver any time  any size  any priority bandwidth to their customers 
ciena s lightworks architecture is an optical networking architecture designed to reduce both the capital and the operating costs of building service provider networks 
the lightworks architecture addresses the critical areas of optical networking long distance optical transport  short distance optical transport  intelligent optical switching  and network management 
it allows us to combine the functionalities that previously required several network elements into a single element  thereby lowering the customer s capital equipment requirements and simplifying its network so as to reduce operating costs 
the products included in ciena s lightworks architecture can be sold together as a complete network solution or separately as best of breed solutions 
products include four generations of long distance optical transport systems multiwave  multiwave sentry  multiwave sentry  and multiwave corestream 
lightworks also includes ciena s short distance optical transport products multiwave firefly  multiwave metro  and multiwave metro one 
ciena s lightworks architecture also includes its multiwave coredirector family of optical core switching products multiwave coredirector and multiwave coredirector ci 
our lightworks architecture also includes multiwave metrodirector k the recently introduced multiwave metrodirector k is a next generation multi service access and switching platform designed to help carriers alleviate metro area gridlock  while providing the opportunity for increased revenue and performance from their existing networks 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share less underwriters discounts and commissions 
concurrent with this offering we also completed a public offering of convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the aggregate net proceeds from these offerings were approximately billion  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
pending our use of the net proceeds  we have invested them in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
on march   ciena acquired all of the outstanding capital stock  and assumed the options of cyras systems  inc cyras  a privately held provider of next generation optical networking systems based in fremont  california 
the purchase price was approximately billion and consisted of the issuance of approximately million shares of ciena common stock  the assumption of approximately million stock options and the indirect assumption of million principal amount of cyras s convertible subordinated indebtedness 
the cyras k product  which has become ciena s multiwave metrodirector k  became available for shipment in the third quarter of fiscal as part of our review of financial results for  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets including significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of cyras 
pursuant to statement financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas the assessment was performed because of the significant negative industry and economic trends affecting both the company s current operations and expected future sales of multiwave metrodirector k as well as the general decline of technology valuations 
it was concluded that the decline in market conditions within the company s industry was significant and other than temporary 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of billion to reduce goodwill during the fourth quarter of based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their estimated fair value 
the write down is related to the goodwill associated with the cyras transaction 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the consolidation of excess facilities 
the consolidation included the closure of certain manufacturing warehouse facilities and the consolidation of certain operational centers related to business activities that have been restructured 
the restructuring charge had two primary components 
the first component was million related lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs 
this amount is included in the company s accrued liabilities at october  as of october   none of these exit costs have been paid  the company expects to pay these costs over the remaining lease terms 
there have been no adjustments to the lease liability 
the second component of the restructuring was a write down to fair value of leasehold improvements and fixed assets associated with the leases being consolidated 
the company determined the fair value of these assets based on current market conditions and recent sales activity from this type of asset 
the write down of these assets is classified in the restructuring charges on the statement of operations 
as of october   the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons  which was an increase of  persons over the approximate  employed on october  on november   we announced a workforce reduction of approximately employees concentrated in manufacturing operations staff 
affected employees will be paid through january  and will be eligible for additional severance packages 
they also received outplacement assistance and training 
ciena will record a restructuring charge of between million and million associated with this action  in the first quarter of fiscal for much of the last five years the market for our equipment has been influenced by the entry into the communications services business of a substantial number of new companies 
in the united states this was due largely to changes in the regulatory environment  in particular those brought about by the telecommunications act of these new companies raised billions of dollars in capital  much of which they invested in new plant  causing an acceleration in the growth of the market for telecommunications equipment 
the last year or so has seen a reversal of this trend  including the failure of a large number of the new entrants and a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to the industry 
this  in turn  has caused a substantial reduction in demand for telecommunications equipment  including our products 
this industry trend has been compounded by the slowing not only of the united states economy which is now in recession but the economies in virtually all of the countries in which we are marketing our products 
moreover  the economic uncertainty has been accentuated by the events of september  the combination of these factors has caused most of our customers to become more conservative in their capital investment plans and more uncertain about their future purchases 
as a consequence  we are facing a market that is  both reduced in absolute size and more difficult to predict and plan for 
results of operations fiscal years ended  and revenue 
we recognized  million  million and million in revenue for the fiscal years ended october    and  respectively 
the increase in revenue of approximately million  or from fiscal to was due primarily to an increase in shipments of both long distance optical transport products  primarily configured for gbps transmission rates  and intelligent core switching products 
the increase in revenue of approximately million  or  from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in shipments across all product lines 
ciena recognized revenues from a total of  and optical equipment customers during fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal  sprint and qwest communications each accounted for at least of our revenue and together they accounted for of total revenue 
during fiscal  sprint  qwest communications and gts network ltd 
each accounted for at least of our revenue and combined they accounted for of total revenue 
during fiscal sprint  worldcom  and gts network ltd  each accounted for at least of our revenue and combined they accounted for of total revenue 
revenue from overseas sales accounted for approximately  and  of our total revenue during fiscal  and respectively 
for the reasons discussed above in the overview  we anticipate our revenue for first quarter of fiscal  will be less  and possibly significantly less than our revenues in the th fiscal quarter given the current uncertainty in the market we have limited visibility of our revenues for fiscal see risk factors 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing and engineering  furnishing and installation operations 
gross profit was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
gross margin was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in inventory obsolescence costs and price reductions resulting from competitive pressures  which were partially offset by increased sales of higher margin products such as multiwave coredirector systems and lightworks on center network element and service management software 
the increase in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to lower component costs and improved production efficiencies 
as discussed above  our current ability to make reliable forecasts for fiscal is limited 
it is possible  however  that we could experience reductions of gross margins compared to fiscal as a result of one or more of several factors  including changes in product mix  downward pressure on pricing due to more aggressive competition  decreased manufacturing efficiencies  increases in inventory obsolescence  and increased costs of components 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the approximate million  or increase from fiscal to was related to increases in staffing  prototype parts and depreciation expenses 
the approximate million  or increase from fiscal to in research and development expenses related to increased staffing levels  purchases of materials used in development of new or enhanced product prototypes  and outside consulting services in support of certain developments and design efforts 
during fiscal  and  research and development expenses were and of revenue  respectively 
ciena expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue during fiscal to support the continued development of ciena s intelligent optical networking products  the exploration of new or complementary technologies  and the pursuit of various cost reduction strategies 
ciena has expensed research and development costs as incurred 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to in selling and marketing expenses were primarily the result of increases in staffing levels  commissions earned  depreciation expenses  trade show participation and promotional costs 
during fiscal  and selling and marketing expenses were  and of revenue  respectively 
the company anticipates that its selling and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as additional personnel are hired and additional offices are opened to pursue new customers and market opportunities 
the company also expects the portion of selling and marketing expenses attributable to technical assistance and field support  specifically in europe  latin america  and asia  will increase as the company s installed base of operational multiwave systems increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the million or increase from fiscal year to were primarily the result of increased staffing levels and outside consulting services 
during fiscal  and general and administrative expenses were  and of revenue  respectively 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as a result of the expansion of the company s administrative staff required to support its expanding operations 
settlement of accrued contract obligation 
the million gain from settlement of accrued contract obligation recorded in fiscal relates to the july termination of certain accrued contract obligations that ciena received from iaxis limited  one of ciena s european customers 
in september  ciena was informed that an administrative order had been issued by a london court against iaxis limited 
as a result of this order  joint administrators were appointed to manage the business of iaxis limited while they marketed the business for sale and formulated a reorganization of the company 
see provision for doubtful accounts below 
deferred stock compensation costs 
deferred stock compensation costs were million during fiscal as part of our acquisition of cyras  we recorded million of deferred stock compensation relating to the unvested stock options and restricted stock assumed in the acquisition 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the remaining vesting period of the applicable options 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill costs were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the approximate million increase in amortization of goodwill from fiscal to was related to ciena s acquisition of cyras  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
we recorded goodwill and workforce related intangibles of approximately billion representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired 
the goodwill and workforce acquired from the cyras purchase was amortized using a straight line method based upon a three to seven year period during fiscal as a result of the issuance of sfas no 
 we will not record amortization in subsequent fiscal years 
see goodwill impairment below 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the approximate million  or increase in amortization from to is related to our acquisition of cyras  for which we recorded million worth of other intangible assets 
the other intangible assets from the cyras purchase will be amortized over a seven year period 
see goodwill impairment below 
in process research and development 
in connection with the cyras acquisition  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development during fiscal this represents the estimated value of purchased in process technology related to cyras s k product development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition 
the amount of purchase price allocated to in process research and development was determined using the discounted cash flow method 
this method consisted of estimating future net cash flows attributable to the in process k technology for a discrete projection period and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
restructuring costs 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to consolidation of excess facilities during fiscal the consolidation included the closure of certain manufacturing warehouse facilities and the consolidation of certain operational centers related to business activities that have been restructured 
the charge included million primarily related to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs and also included an million write down related to property and equipment consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and production equipment 
goodwill impairment 
as part of our review of financial results for fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets including significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of cyras 
the assessment was performed pursuant to statement financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas because of the significant negative industry and economic trends affecting both the company s current operations and expected future sales of multiwave metrodirector k as well as the general decline of technology valuations 
the conclusion of that assessment was that the decline in market conditions within the company s industry was significant and other than temporary 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of billion to reduce goodwill during the fourth quarter of based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value 
the write down is related to the goodwill associated with the cyras transaction 
fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows for the operating entity  which had separately identifiable cash flows 
the cash flow periods used were six years  applying annual growth rates ranging from to 
the discount rate used was  and the terminal values were estimated based upon a terminal growth rates of 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate and estimated terminal values  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rate was based upon the company s weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with its operations 
merger related costs 
the merger costs for fiscal of approximately million were related to ciena s acquisition of omnia and lightera 
these costs include an million non cash charge for the acceleration of warrants based upon ciena s common stock price on june  and million for fees  legal and accounting services and other costs 
the warrants were issued to one of omnia s potential customers and became exercisable upon the consummation of the merger between ciena and omnia 
provision for doubtful accounts 
ciena performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral from its customers 
ciena maintains an allowance for potential losses when identified 
ciena s allowance for doubtful accounts as of october  and october  was million and million  respectively 
approximately million of the october  balance relates to provisions made for doubtful accounts associated with iaxis limited  one of ciena s european customers 
in september  ciena was informed that an administrative order had been issued by a london court against iaxis limited 
as a result of this order  joint administrators were appointed to manage the business of iaxis limited while they marketed the business for sale and formulated a reorganization of the company 
in november  ciena was notified that dynegy inc had entered into a proposed agreement to acquire the assets and stock of iaxis limited from the administrators 
as a consequence of the terms of a the proposed agreement between the administrators of iaxis limited and dynegy  and of b a related sales agreement between ciena and dynegy  ciena expected to realize approximately million of the gross outstanding accounts receivable balance due from iaxis limited as of october  in july ciena received approximately million of the gross outstanding accounts receivable balance due from iaxis limited primarily through the sales agreement with dynegy 
accordingly  ciena recognized a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts of million during fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  consists of interest income earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  net of interest expense associated with the company s debt obligations 
other income expense  net  was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in other income expense from fiscal to was due to increases in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities offset by increased interest expense 
the decrease in other income expense from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in fiscal as compared to fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
ciena s provision benefit for income taxes was  and of pre tax earnings loss for fiscal  and  respectively 
the income tax provision for was million 
the income tax provision for was higher than the expected benefit due to the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment  and in process research and development 
the income tax provision for was lower than the expected primarily due to benefits from research and development tax credits 
the benefit for fiscal was less than the expected statutory benefit of due to non deductible merger costs 
as of october   ciena s deferred tax asset was million 
the realization of this asset could be adversely affected if future earnings are lower than anticipated 
liquidity and capital resources at october   ciena s principal source of liquidity was its cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  and  million short term and long term investments 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss adjusted for the non cash charges of amortization of goodwill  other intangibles  deferred stock compensation and debt issuance costs  depreciation  in process research and development  tax benefit related to exercise of stock options  inventory obsolescence  and warranty  increases in accounts payable and accruals  and deferred revenue and other obligations  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses 
cash used in investment activities in fiscal  and was  million  million and million  respectively 
investment activities included the net redemption of million of short and long term investments during and the net purchase of million and  million of short and long term investments during and  respectively 
investment activities also include approximately million and million of equity investments in private companies during fiscal and  respectively 
also included in investment activities were additions to capital equipment and leasehold improvements in fiscal  and of million  million and million  respectively 
the capital equipment expenditures were primarily for test  manufacturing and computer equipment 
the company expects additional combined capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures of approximately million to be made during fiscal to support selling and marketing  manufacturing and product development activities and the construction of leasehold improvements for its facilities  and we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
we generated  million  million and million in cash from financing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  ciena received million from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share less underwriters discounts and commissions 
concurrent with the offering of common stock  we completed a public offering of convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
net proceeds from these offerings were approximately  million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering 
during fiscal  ciena received million from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
during fiscal  ciena received million from the exercise of stock options  the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan  and from the additional capitalization of omnia and lightera 
cyras systems llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  has million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
in the event that the holders of the cyras notes convert their notes into our common stock  we would have to issue a significant number of shares of additional common stock 
based on the exchange ratio for the cyras acquisition of approximately  we will have to issue approximately  shares of our common stock if holders of the entire million of convertible notes decided to convert their notes 
at our current stock price it appears more likely that the holders of the cyras notes will not elect to convert them into our common stock before march  as a result  it is probable that we will have to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of their principal balance on april  if all of the note holders accept that offer  we will have to expend approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents for the repurchase 
we believe that our existing cash balances and investments  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements at least through the end of fiscal however  investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies may require us to seek additional financing prior to that time 
we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity financing will be available when required or  if available  that we can secure it on terms satisfactory to us

the detailed discussion of risk factors below addresses the principal factors that have caused these variations in the past  and may cause similar variations in the future 
see risk factors 
ciena s revenues increased during each of the seven quarters beginning in the first quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal due to a strong demand across existing products and introduction of new products such as multiwave corestream long distance optical transport systems configured for both gbps and gbps transmission rates  and our intelligent optical core switching product the multiwave coredirector 
the decline in revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter of fiscal was primarily the result of a reduction in sales of our long distance optical transport systems partially offset by a continued increase in sales of our intelligent optical switching and multi service access products  the multiwave coredirector and multiwave metrodirector k ciena s gross margin percentage improved from the first quarter fiscal to the second quarter fiscal as a result of component cost reductions  production efficiencies  favorable product mix and relative stable sales pricing 
the decline in gross margins in the third quarter of fiscal was primarily the result of increased inventory obsolescence costs due to the sudden decrease in demand for our older generation long distance optical transport products 
the further decline in gross margin during the fourth quarter of fiscal was primarily the result of increased production inefficiencies and costs due to lower demand requirements 
ciena s operating expenses have increased in each of the last eight quarters due to continued investments in research and development  selling and marketing  and infrastructure activities 
during fiscal  ciena s operating expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars and as percentage of revenue 
we expect to preserve and enhance our market leadership and build on our installed base with new and additional products in conjunction with increased investments in selling  marketing  and customer service activities 
see risk factors 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  including the reports we incorporate by reference  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our business has been adversely affected by recent developments in the communications industry and the economy in general for much of the last five years the market for our equipment has been influenced by the entry into the communications services business of a substantial number of new companies 
in the united states this was due largely to changes in the regulatory environment  in particular those brought about by the telecommunications act of these new companies raised billions of dollars in capital  much of which they invested in new plants  causing an acceleration in the growth of the market for telecommunications equipment 
the last year or so has seen a reversal of this trend  including the failure of a large number of the new entrants and a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to the industry 
this  in turn  has caused a substantial reduction in demand for telecommunications equipment  including our products 
this industry trend has been compounded by the slowing not only of the united states economy which is now in recession but the economies in virtually all of the countries in which we are marketing our products 
moreover  the economic uncertainty has been accentuated by the events of september  the combination of these factors has caused most of our customers to become more conservative in their capital investment plans and more uncertain about their future purchases 
as a consequence  we are facing a market that is  both reduced in absolute size and more difficult to predict and plan for 
we expect the factors described above to affect our business  for at least several quarters if not longer  in several significant ways compared to the recent past it is likely that our markets will be characterized by reduced capital expenditures by our customers  our ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales will be substantially reduced  managing our expenditures will be significantly more difficult in light of the uncertainties surrounding in our business  increased competition resulting from reduced demand will put substantial downward pressures on the pricing of our products  tending to reduce our profit margins  increased competition has also enabled customers to insist on more favorable terms and conditions for sales  including extended payment terms or other financing assistance  as a condition of procuring their business  and the result in any or combination of these factors could be reduced revenues and profitability and perhaps losses in particular periods or for the entire year 
our results can fluctuate unpredictably in general  our revenues and operating results in any reporting period may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including fluctuations in demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the timing and size of orders from customers  changes in customers requirements  including changes or cancellations to orders from customers  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in the price or availability of components for our products  readiness of customer sites for installation  satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria and related revenue recognition issues  manufacturing and shipment delays and deferrals  increased service  installation  warranty or repair costs  the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employee gains on stock options exercised  and changes in general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications and intelligent optical networking industries 
our intelligent optical networking products require large investments 
we have only a limited number of potential customers in each geographic market  and each has unique needs 
our customers are generally technically sophisticated and demanding 
as a result  the sales cycles for our products are long  often as much as a year or two between initial contact with a potential customer and the recognition of revenue from sales to the customer 
our customers purchases tend to be large and sporadic  depending upon their need to build a customer base  their plans for expanding their networks  the availability of financing  and the effects of regulatory and business conditions in the countries in which they operate 
as a result  their purchase decisions can be unpredictable and subject to unanticipated changes 
our results  in turn  tend to fluctuate unpredictably 
this tendency has been amplified by conditions arising from the current uncertain economic environment 
current economic conditions have made it more difficult to make reliable estimates of future revenues 
fluctuations in our revenues can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating profits 
we budget expense levels on our expectations of long term future revenue 
these budgets reflect the substantial investments in financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources we must make to support large customers  even though we are unsure of the volume  duration or timing of their purchases 
in addition  we continue to make substantial expenditures on the development of new and enhanced products 
any substantial adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of revenue is difficult and takes time 
consequently if our revenue does decline  in the short run our levels of inventory  operating expenses and general overhead would be high relative to our revenue  reducing our profitability  and perhaps resulting in operating losses 
our future success will depend on our ability to acquire new customers historically  a large percentage of our sales have been made to emerging carriers  many of which have recently begun to experience severe financial difficulties 
consequently  we expect our sales to emerging carriers to be reduced  and our future success will depend on our ability to increase our sales to incumbent carriers  including  in the united states  the regional bell operating companies rbocs  and abroad  the large  traditional telecommunications operators tos  many of which were formerly government owned post  telephone and telegraph enterprises 
these large companies typically require longer sales cycles  many have long standing supplier relationships with other vendors  and our experience in selling to them is limited 
if we do not succeed in penetrating this segment of the market  our business could suffer 
we may not be able to successfully complete development and achieve commercial acceptance of new products it is necessary for us to continually enhance our products certain enhancements to our products are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
for example  we expect to offer additional feature enhancement releases of the multiwave coredirector product line over the life of the product and we expect to continue to enhance features of our multiwave corestream  multiwave metro and multiwave metrodirector k products over the life of these products 
the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability  involves a number of steps  including completion of product development  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  including asics  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of software  and establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements 
each of these steps in turn presents serious risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of the product 
specialized asics and intensive software testing and validation are key to the timely introduction of enhancements to the multiwave coredirector and multiwave metrodirector k product lines  and schedule delays are common in the final validation phase  as well as in the manufacture of specialized asics 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of these products 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce these products in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
the markets for our multiwave coredirector and multiwave metrodirector k product lines are relatively new 
we are only beginning to establish commercial acceptance of these products  and we cannot be certain that the substantial sales and marketing efforts necessary to achieve commercial acceptance in traditionally long sales cycles will be successful 
if the markets for these products do not develop  or the products are not accepted by the market  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
we have recently written down the value of the goodwill associated with our acquisition of cyras  the source of our multiwave metrodirector k product  in recognition of what we believe to be a significant and permanent decline in the market for these types of products 
we face intense competition which could hurt our sales and profitability the market for optical networking equipment is extremely competitive 
competition in the optical networking market is based on varying combinations of price  functionality  software functionality  manufacturing capability  installation  services  scalability and the ability of the system solution to meet customers immediate and future network requirements 
a small number of very large companies  including alcatel  cisco systems  fujitsu group  hitachi  lucent technologies  nec corporation  nortel networks  siemens ag and telefon ab lm ericsson  have historically dominated the telecommunications equipment industry 
they all have substantial financial  marketing  manufacturing and intellectual property resources and greater resources than ciena to develop or acquire new technologies 
they also often have existing relationships with our potential customers 
because we sell systems that compete directly with product offerings of these companies  and in some cases displace or replace their equipment  we represent a competitive threat 
the continued expansion of our product offerings with the multiwave coredirector and multiwave metrodirector k product lines and enhancements to our multiwave corestream and multiwave metro product lines likely will increase this perceived threat 
the recent decline in the market for optical networking equipment has resulted in even greater competitive pressures 
we expect that the aggressive tactics we have confronted on the part of many of these competitors will continue  and perhaps become more severe 
these tactics include price discounting  particularly when a competitor is selling used equipment or inventory that a competitor has written down or written off  early announcements of competing products and other marketing efforts  one stop shopping options  customer financing assistance  marketing and advertising assistance  and intellectual property disputes 
these tactics can be particularly effective in a highly concentrated customer base such as ours 
our customers are under increasing competitive pressure to deliver their services at the lowest possible cost 
this pressure may result in the pricing of optical networking systems becoming a more important factor in customer decisions  which may favor larger competitors that can spread the effect of price discounts in their optical networking products across a larger array of products and services and across a larger customer base than ours 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in the average sales price for our products by a reduction in the cost of our products  our gross profit margins will be adversely affected 
our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross profit margins would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our customers have indicated that they intend to establish a relationship with at least two vendors for optical networking products 
with respect to customers for whom we are the only supplier of intelligent optical products  we do not know when or if these customers will select a second vendor or what impact the selection might have on purchases from us 
if a second optical networking supplier is chosen  these customers could reduce their purchases from us  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us 
new competitors are emerging to compete with our existing products as well as our future products 
we expect new competitors to continue to emerge as the optical networking market continues to expand 
these companies may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly due to the narrow and exclusive focus of their efforts 
several of these competitors have raised significant cash and they have in some cases offered stock in their companies  positions on technical advisory boards  or have provided significant vendor financing to attract new customers 
our inability to compete successfully against these companies would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to respond rapidly to technological changes  our products will become obsolete  damaging our short term prospects and threatening our long term survival the market for optical networking products is likely to be characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  and recurring changes in customer requirements 
to succeed in this market  we must continue to develop new products and new features for existing products 
doing so is difficult and costly  and there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful 
in addition  we must be able to identify and gain access to promising new technologies 
a failure to keep pace with technological advances would impair the competitiveness of our products and sooner or later do serious harm to our business 
several of our new products  including the multiwave coredirector  the multiwave metrodirector k and enhancements to the multiwave corestream and multiwave metro  are based on complex technology which could result in unanticipated delays in the development  manufacturing or deployment of these products 
our lightworks initiative  which involves modifying these products to enable customers to implement a new type of network architecture  entails similar development risks 
our customers often require extensive testing of new products before accepting them  and we are typically unable to recognize revenue until the tests are completed satisfactorily 
the certification process for new telecommunications equipment used in the networks of the rbocs and tos tends to be particularly lengthy and difficult 
complying with these certification requirements may involve unanticipated delays that could adversely affect the timing of our ability to sell our products to these larger carriers 
concentration of customers 
although the number of customers who make purchases from us continues to grow  a substantial fraction of our revenues continues to come from sales to a small number of customers 
in fiscal  of our revenues came from our two most significant customers  sprint and qwest 
the loss of  or a substantial reduction in purchases by  either of these customers could reduce our revenues materially 
both of these companies have been affected to some extent by the current economic recession and the even more difficult conditions in the communications industry 
the communications industry is  moreover  undergoing a period of consolidation 
it is possible that either of these customers could become a party to a merger or other business combination 
the distraction and uncertainty inevitably attendant on such a transaction could delay or alter decisions on network deployments or capital expenditures  and this could result in delayed or reduced purchases from us 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers industry and economic conditions have weakened the financial position of some of our customers 
to sell to some of these customers we may be required to take risks of uncollectable accounts 
while we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves  it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts 
such write downs or write offs  if large  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we also continue to experience demands from customer that we finance sales to them 
while we have done only a limited amount of such financing in the past  the increasingly competitive environment in which we are now operating may require us to engage in more customer financing in the future 
our ability to recognize revenue from financed sales will depend on the relative financial condition of the specific customer  among other factors 
further  we will need to evaluate the collectability of receivables from these customers if their financial condition deteriorates in the future 
any change in the financial condition of customers to which we provide financing could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our strategy involves pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments that may not be successful our business strategy includes acquiring or making strategic investments in other companies with a view to expanding our portfolio of products and services  acquiring new technologies  and accelerating the development of new or improved products 
to do so  we may issue equity that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership or incur debt or assume indebtedness 
in addition  we may incur significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter fiscal we incurred a significant write off of goodwill associated with our cyras acquisition completed in march acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from our core business  potential difficulties in completing projects of the acquired company  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and dependence on unfamiliar or relatively small supply partners 
in addition acquisitions and strategic investments may involve risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions and of obtaining insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky 
not all of those we have made in the past have been successful  and it is possible that acquisitions we make in the future may be unsuccessful  even to the extent of materially and adversely affecting our business 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers  and for some items we do not have a substitute supplier we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to manufacture and test our products 
our products include several high performance components for which reliable  high volume suppliers are particularly limited 
furthermore  some key optical and electronic components we use in our optical transport systems are currently available only from sole or limited sources  and in some cases  that source also is a competitor 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
failures of components affect the reliability and performance of our products and can reduce customer confidence in them  perhaps to the extent of adversely affecting our financial performance 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in receipt of components and have received components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which  in turn  could harm our business 
a consolidation among suppliers of these components or adverse developments in their businesses affecting their ability to supply us  could adversely impact the availability of components on which we depend 
delayed deliveries of key components from these sources could adversely affect our business 
any delays in component availability for any of our products or test equipment could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenue from them 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
we rely on contract manufacturers for our products we rely on a small number of contract manufacturers to manufacture our multiwave coredirector and multiwave metrodirector k product lines and some of the components for our other products 
the qualification of these manufacturers is an expensive and time consuming process  and these contract manufacturers build modules for other companies  including our competitors 
in addition  we do not have contracts in place with many of these manufacturers 
we may not be able to effectively manage our relationships with our manufacturers and we cannot be certain that they will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner 
we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers several months prior to scheduled delivery of products 
if we overestimate our future product requirements  the contract manufacturers may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
conversely  if we underestimate our future product requirements the contract manufacturer may not have enough product to meet our customer requirements  and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue 
if we cannot effectively manage these manufacturers and forecast future demand  or if they fail to deliver components on time  our business may suffer 
some of our suppliers are also competitors some of our component suppliers are both primary sources for components and major competitors in the market for system equipment 
for example  we buy components from alcatel  lucent technologies  nec corporation  nortel networks  and siemens ag 
each of these companies offers optical communications systems and equipment that are competitive with our products 
a decline in reliability or other adverse change in these supply relationships could harm our business 
our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on intellectual property rights of others we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into non disclosure and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and consultants  and license agreements with our corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our products  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we are involved in an intellectual property dispute regarding the use of our technology and may become involved with additional disputes in the future 
such lawsuits can be costly and may significantly divert time and attention from some members of our personnel 
we have received  and may receive in the future  notices from holders of patents in the optical technology field that raise issues of possible infringement by our products 
questions of infringement in the optical networking equipment market often involve highly technical and subjective analysis 
we cannot assure you that any of these patent holders or others will not in the future initiate legal proceedings against us  or that we will be successful in defending against these actions 
we are involved in an intellectual property dispute regarding the possible infringement of our products 
in the past  we have been forced to take a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  or to redesign or stop selling the product that includes the challenged intellectual property 
if we are sued for infringement and are unsuccessful in defending the suit  we could be subject to significant damages  and our business and customer relationships could be adversely affected 
product performance problems could limit our sales prospects the production of new optical networking products and systems with high technology content involves occasional problems as the technology and manufacturing methods mature 
if significant reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  including those due to faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with reworking our manufacturing processes  high service and warranty expenses  high inventory obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there will be interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we can not promptly resolve  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could harm our business 
we face risks associated with our international operations we market  sell and service our products globally 
we have established offices around the world  including in north america  europe  latin america and in the asia pacific region 
we will continue to expand our international operations and enter new international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successfully direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors 
these include greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  certification requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  political and economic instability  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  service provider and government spending patterns  and natural disasters 
such factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to repay or repurchase our notes we have approximately million of outstanding principal indebtedness  primarily related to notes offered by us and the assumption of notes from the acquisition of cyras systems  inc as a result of this indebtedness  we have significant principal and interest payment obligations 
there is the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness  including the notes  when due 
we may also add equipment loans and lease lines to finance capital expenditures and may obtain additional long term debt  working capital lines of credit and lease lines 
our leverage could have important negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources  and making it difficult or impossible for us to pay the principal amount of the notes at maturity or the repurchase price of the notes upon a change of control  thereby causing an event of default under the indenture 
cyras systems llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  has million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
in the event that the holders of the cyras notes convert their notes into our common stock  we would have to issue a significant number of shares of additional common stock 
based on the exchange ratio for the cyras acquisition of approximately  we will have to issue approximately  shares of our common stock if holders of the entire million of convertible notes decided to convert their notes 
at our current stock price it appears more likely that the holders of the cyras notes will not elect to convert them into our common stock before march  as a result  it is probable that we will have to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of their principal balance on april  if all of the note holders accept that offer  we will have to expend approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents for the repurchase 
our stock price may exhibit volatility our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and is likely to remain volatile in the future 
volatility can arise as a result of the activities of short sellers and risk arbitrageurs  and may have little relationship to our financial results or prospects 
volatility can also result from any divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts  and announcements that we  our competitors  or our customers may make 
divergence between our actual results and our anticipated results  analyst estimates and public announcements by us  our competitors  or by customers will occur from time to time in the future  with resulting stock price volatility  irrespective of our overall year to year performance or long term prospects 
as long as we continue to depend on a limited customer base  and particularly when a substantial majority of their purchases consist of newly introduced products  there is substantial chance that our quarterly results will vary widely 
forward looking statements some of the statements contained  or incorporated by reference  in this annual report discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other forward looking information 
those statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements 
the forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions 
in some cases  you can identify these so called forward looking statements by words like may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of those words and other comparable words 
you should be aware that those statements only reflect our predictions 
actual events or results may differ substantially 
important factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the forward looking statements are disclosed throughout this report  particularly under the heading risk factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and if our exposure increases  adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposures have been related to non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency if this exposure becomes material 
as of october   the assets and liabilities of the company related to non dollar denominated currencies were not material 
therefore we do not expect an increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on the company s financial position
