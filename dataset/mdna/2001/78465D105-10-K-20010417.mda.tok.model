recently issued financial accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gain and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that an entity must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transitions that receive hedge accounting 
the company adopted sfas on january  the company has one interest rate swap agreement which does not qualify as a cash flow hedge as the company did not prepare the required formal documentation 
accordingly  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects to record a net of tax cumulative effect type adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive loss of  to recognize the interest swap at fair value at january  future changes in the fair value will be recorded through current operations 
item a the securities and exchange commission requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in interest rates in their financial statements 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt based on fluctuations in the bank s prime rate 
to assess exposure to interest rate changes  the company has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates in the first quarter of fiscal year this analysis indicates that such market movements would reduce fiscal net income  based on the december debt balance  by approximately  actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this hypothetical amount based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements and the company s actual debt balances
