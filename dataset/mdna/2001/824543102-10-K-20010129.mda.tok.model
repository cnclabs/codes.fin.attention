item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a full service manufacturer of blanks and stamped components for the automotive and light truck  heavy truck and other industrial markets 
the company s engineered products include blanks  stamped components and modular assemblies 
the company also designs  engineers and manufactures precision tools and dies for the automotive and other industries 
in addition  the company provides steel processing services  which include pickling hot rolled steel  slitting  edge trimming  roller leveling and cutting to length of both hot and cold rolled steel 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were generated by sales to the automotive and light truck and heavy truck industries 
the company s origins date back to when its predecessor  shiloh tool die mfg 
company  began to design and manufacture precision tools and dies 
as an outgrowth of its precision tool and die expertise  shiloh tool die mfg 
company expanded into blanking and stamping operations in the early s 
in april  shiloh industries  inc was organized as a delaware corporation to serve as a holding company for its seven operating subsidiaries and in july completed an initial public offering of common stock 
in january  the company entered into a joint venture with rouge steel company and formed a limited liability company  shiloh of michigan  llc  to produce engineered steel blanks 
the company is an equity owner in this joint venture 
on november   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of greenfield die manufacturing corp  headquartered in canton  michigan 
greenfield die manufacturing corp 
provides a variety of value added processes  including tool and die design and build  stamping  assembly  welding  prototyping operations and mold design and manufacture 
in august  the company acquired c h  headquartered in utica  michigan 
in october  the company closed c h and the equipment was either transferred to other shiloh locations or is being held for sale 
in october  the company incorporated jefferson blanking  inc and commenced operations in july on november   the company acquired mtd automotive  the automotive division of mtd products inc  headquartered in cleveland  ohio 
mtd automotive is primarily a tier i supplier and primarily serves the automotive industry by providing metal stampings and modular assemblies 
the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of mtd automotive consisted of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of common stock to mtd products inc  of which  were contingently returnable at november  in january  the aggregate consideration was increased based upon the performance of mtd automotive during the first twelve months subsequent to closing 
specifically  the  contingently returnable shares of common stock were not required to be returned to the company and the company issued mtd products inc an additional  shares of common stock and the company s wholly owned subsidiary issued a note payable in full on november   in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the company is guarantor of the note 
in addition  in accordance with the purchase agreement  approximately million was returned to the company for settlement of price concessions and capital expenditure reimbursements 
these adjustments were reflected in the company s financial statements for the year ended october  as adjustments to the purchase price 
also in accordance with the purchase agreement  the purchase price may be adjusted at the end of fiscal and fiscal upon resolution of certain contingencies set forth in the purchase agreement 
in july  the company announced that it would seek strategic alternatives for two of its tool and die facilities  c h and canton tool die  and one of its steel processing facilities  valley city steel 
in october  the company closed c h and transferred certain of its assets to other subsidiaries of the company 
the company currently intends to sell the assets of canton tool die  the assets of the steel processing facility of valley city steel and certain assets of c h 
the company anticipates these sales will be completed in fiscal on august   the company acquired substantially all the assets of dickson for approximately million  including approximately million in acquisition costs 
in january  certain purchase price adjustments were made pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement in which approximately million was released from escrow and returned to the company 
for accounting purposes  these adjustments were reflected in the company s financial statements for the year ended october  the acquisition reflects an expansion of the company s capabilities and improves its position as a key supplier of engineered metal products for automotive seating and interior structural applications 
in analyzing the financial aspects of the company s operations  the following factors should be considered 
plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
because the company performs a number of different operations  it is not meaningful to analyze simply the total tons of steel processed 
for example  blanking and stamping involve more operational processes  from the design and manufacture of tools and dies to the production and packaging of the final product  than the company s other services and therefore generally have higher margins 
a significant portion of the company s steel processing and blanking products and services is provided to customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a tolling fee for the operations that it performs without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
although the proportion of tons of steel which the company uses or process that is directly owned as compared to toll processed may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on customers needs  the company estimates that of total tons used or processed in its operations  approximately in  in  and in  were used or processed on a toll processing basis 
revenues from toll processing as a percent of total revenues were approximately in  in and in revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not 
consequently  toll processing generally results in lower revenue  but higher gross margin  than directly owned steel processing 
therefore  an increase in the proportion of total revenues attributable to directly owned steel processing may result in higher revenues but lower gross margins 
the company s stamping operations use more directly owned steel than its other operations 
changes in the price of scrap steel can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations because substantially all of its operations generate engineered scrap steel 
engineered scrap steel is a planned by product of our processing operations 
changes in the price of steel  however  also can impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
the company actively manages its exposure to changes in the price of steel  and  in most instances  passes along the rising price of steel to its customers 
at times  however  the company has been unable to do so 
the company s results of operations have been adversely affected by a large number of facility expansions and start up operations in recent periods  such as shiloh de mexico sa de sa shiloh of mexico and ohio welded blank  an expansion facility of medina blanking  inc owb 
operations at expanded and new facilities are typically less efficient than established operations due to the implementation of new production processes 
in addition  the company depends on customers to implement their purchase programs in a timely manner  which affects the company s ability to achieve satisfactory plant utilization rates 
when the customers fail to do so  results are negatively impacted 
in the company s experience  operations at expanded or new facilities may be adversely impacted by the above factors for several periods

excluding mtd automotive and owb  scrap sales increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was for fiscal compared to for fiscal revenues from the toll processed steel were for fiscal compared to for fiscal this shift in the mix of revenue from toll processing to directly owned steel primarily resulted from the addition of mtd automotive and owb  which derived substantial revenue from directly owned steel 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in gross margin decreased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in the increase in gross profit is primarily related to the acquisition of mtd automotive  which has historically generated lower gross margins than the historical results of the company s existing operations 
the decline in gross margin is primarily a result of the addition of mtd automotive and owb  which derive substantial revenue from sales of directly owned steel which results in higher revenues but lower gross margins 
in addition  lower gross margin and lower gross profit were experienced at canton tool and die and c h as a result of the softening in the tool and die business and at valley city steel as a result of the weakening steel industry 
excluding mtd automotive  owb  canton tool and die  c h and valley city steel  gross profit decreased by million and gross margin increased to for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal the largest component of the increase  in dollars  arose principally from the addition of mtd automotive and owb

year ended october  compared to year ended october  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenues is primarily due to increased volumes in our stamping operations  increased tailor welded blanking revenue  increased tool and die sales and the inclusion of a full year of revenue at jefferson blanking 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from sales of scrap steel due to a decline in the price of scrap steel per gross ton from an average of per gross ton during fiscal compared to an average of per gross ton for fiscal revenues from the blanking and stamping operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period in fiscal  while revenue from the other steel processing operations for fiscal decreased approximately from the comparable period in fiscal the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was for fiscal compared to for fiscal revenues from the toll processed steel were for fiscal and for the comparable period in fiscal the increase in the percentage of revenue from directly owned steel processed of approximately was primarily due to the increase in directly owned steel processing revenue and tonnage at certain facilities during the fiscal year due to a shift in customer requirements 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in gross margin decreased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in gross margin was negatively affected by the decrease in the average price of scrap steel per ton during fiscal in addition  gross margin was negatively affected by difficulties that the company experienced in the implementation of one very significant tool and die program which caused significant difficulties at one of our tool and die facilities which resulted in production disruptions 
finally  gross margin was negatively impacted by increased depreciation resulting from increased capital expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal from for the comparable period in fiscal the largest component of the increase  in dollars  arose principally from the addition of corporate personnel and related benefit costs

net income 
net income for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in fiscal this decrease was substantially the result of a decline in scrap prices per gross ton  lower margins on specific tool and die projects  increased depreciation resulting from increased capital expenditures and increased interest expense resulting from increased borrowing for significant capital expenditures made during fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had million of working capital  representing a current ratio of to and debt to total capitalization of 
as a result of this strong financial condition  the company will be able to continue its planned investment in new equipment and facilities through the next fiscal year
