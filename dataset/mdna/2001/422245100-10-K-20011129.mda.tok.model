the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
the following table sets forth the sources of the company s revenues by customer type as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations for the three years ended august   and year ended august  health plan contracts hospital contracts other for information on the company s business segments  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
health plan contracts while the company s revenues historically have been generated primarily by its operating contracts with hospitals  a majority of its fiscal through revenues were generated from programs that are designed to assist health plans in reducing healthcare costs and improving the quality of care for individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease enrolled in their plans 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will result from providing disease management and care enhancement services to health plans 
implementation of the company s first disease management contracts with health plans occurred in fiscal for enrollees of these health plans with diabetes 
while continuing to contract with additional health plans to provide diabetes services in the years since fiscal  the company introduced its cardiac disease management program in fiscal and its respiratory disease management program in fiscal during fiscal the company signed its first contracts with health plans to deliver its cardiac and its respiratory disease programs 
during fiscal  the company announced the launch of its total population care enhancement strategy designed to identify enrollees and provide care enhancement services for enrollees in health plans that have been identified as having or are at risk for having one or more high cost diseases or impact conditions 
the company s disease management and care enhancement programs assist enrollees and the providers of healthcare in contracting health plans with 
table of contents specific disease or condition related care enhancement services 
the company believes that its patient and physician support regimens  delivered and or supervised by a multi disciplinary team  will assist in assuring that effective care for the treatment of the disease or condition is provided to enrollees and that this focus will improve the health status of the enrollee populations with the disease or condition and will reduce both the short term and long term healthcare costs of these enrollees 
the company s health plan disease management and care enhancement services range from telephone and mail contacts directed primarily to enrollees with targeted diseases that can be provided from one of the company s four centralized operating unit call centers to services that also include providing local market resources to address acute episode interventions as well as coordination of care with local healthcare providers 
the fees charged by the company vary according to the level of service being provided under each of its health plan customer contracts and are structured primarily as a monthly fee for each member of the health plan identified with the particular chronic disease under contract 
these contracts are generally for terms of three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal and typically provide that between and of the company s fees are at risk subject to the company s performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
approximately one third of the company s health plan revenues recorded during the fiscal year ended august  are subject to confirmation of the company s performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
estimates for performance under the terms of these contracts and other factors affecting revenue recognition are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are provided and adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as information related to performance levels and associated fees become available 
the company anticipates that additional disease management and care enhancement contracts that the company may sign with health plans may take one of several forms  including per member per month payments to the company to cover its services to enrollees  some form of shared savings of overall enrollee healthcare costs  or some combination of these arrangements 
the company anticipates that under most contracts  some portion of the company s fees will be at risk subject to its performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
the membership enrollment and disenrollment processes of the company s health plan customers can result in a seasonal reduction in lives under management during the company s fiscal second and third quarters 
employers typically make decisions on which health insurance carriers they will offer to their employees and also may allow employees to switch between health plans on an annual basis 
historically  the company has found that most of these decisions are made on december st of each year 
an employer s change in health plans or employees change in health plan elections will result in the company s loss of covered lives under management as of december st 
although these decisions may also result in a gain in enrollees  the process of identifying eligible new members to participate in the company s programs is dependent on the submission of healthcare claims  which lags enrollment by an indeterminate period 
as a result  there historically has been a loss of covered lives of between and on december st that is not restored through new member identification until later in the fiscal year thereby negatively affecting company revenues in its second and third fiscal quarters 
disease management and care enhancement health plan contracts require sophisticated management information systems to enable the company to manage the care of large populations of patients with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease as well as certain other medical conditions and to assist in reporting outcomes and costs before and after the company s involvement with a health plan s enrollees 
the company has developed and is continually expanding and improving its clinical management systems which it believes meet its information management needs for its disease management and care enhancement services and has installed and is utilizing the systems for the enrollees of each of its health plan contract customers 
the anticipated 
table of contents expansion and improvements in its information management systems will continue to require significant investments by the company in information technology software  hardware and its information technology staff 
at august   the company had contracts with health plans to provide disease management services in health plan markets 
the company reports the number of disease lives under its health plan contracts utilizing a calculation of equivalent covered lives 
because the company s original disease management efforts focused on enrollees with diabetes and the majority of its lives as of the end of fiscal were diabetes lives  contracted enrollee lives for its cardiac and its respiratory programs are converted into the revenue and service cost equivalent of a diabetes enrollee for reporting and internal management purposes 
while the average service intensity and the company s fee per cardiac enrollee is greater than the service intensity and fee per diabetes enrollee  the company believes that the contribution margin percentage is similar for its diabetes lives and its cardiac disease lives 
the average service and fee intensity of the company s respiratory disease program varies in comparison with a diabetes enrollee depending on whether it involves a lower intensity asthma population or a higher intensity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease population 
however  as with its cardiac disease program  the company believes that the contribution margin percentage is similar for its diabetes lives and its respiratory disease lives 
the number of equivalent lives under management and generating revenues for the company as well as the backlog of equivalent lives under contract and scheduled for implementation but not currently generating revenues are shown below at august   and at august  equivalent lives under management equivalent lives in backlog total equivalent lives during the fiscal years ended august   and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from contracts with two health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues for those years 
during fiscal and  the same two health plans each comprised more than of the company s revenues for those years  during fiscal one of these health plan contracts terminated and a contract with a new health plan comprising more than of the company s fiscal revenues was added 
the loss of either of these contracts or any other large health plan contract or a reduction in the profitability of any of these contracts would have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s health plan contract revenues are dependent upon the contractual relationships it establishes and maintains with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement services to their members 
the terms of these health plan contracts generally range from three to five years with some contracts providing for early termination by the health plan under certain conditions 
because the disease management industry is relatively new and the company s contracts were some of the first large scale contracts to be executed with health plans for disease management services  the renewal experience for these contracts is limited 
no assurances can be given that the results from restructurings and possible terminations at renewal would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
during the year ended august   five health plan contracts were scheduled to expire 
one of these contracts involved a unique pilot program which ended by mutual consent at the end of its term  one contract was terminated as the result of the acquisition of this health plan by another health plan that did not wish to continue providing the services  two contracts were terminated as the result of changes in the strategic direction of these health plans  and one contract was renewed and expanded to include additional lives and an additional disease 
these four discontinued contracts represented of the company s revenues for fiscal 
table of contents during the fiscal year ending august   four health plan customer contracts representing of the company s revenues for fiscal are eligible to be terminated under the terms of the contracts 
three additional contracts representing approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal and which also would have expired under the terms of the contracts during fiscal were renewed during fiscal on terms substantially the same as the terms in the original contracts 
no assurance can be given that unscheduled contract terminations or renegotiations would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition during fiscal in june  the company announced its intent to provide initial funding for the establishment at johns hopkins university and health system of an outcomes verification program to independently evaluate and verify the effectiveness of clinical interventions and their clinical and financial results 
johns hopkins initial work will be to evaluate the company s care enhancement interventions and then  separately  validate and publish the company s outcomes improvement results 
as proposed  the cost of this strategic alliance is approximately million a year over five years 
the company expects this agreement to be executed in its second fiscal quarter of hospital contracts the company s hospital based diabetes treatment centers are located in and operated under contracts with general acute care hospitals 
the primary goal of each center is to create a center of excellence for the treatment of diabetes in the community in which it is located and thereby increase the hospital s market share of diabetes patients and lower the hospital s cost of providing services while enhancing the quality of care to this population 
fee structures under the hospital contracts consist primarily of fixed management fees  but in some contracts may also include variable fees based on the company s performance 
variable fees based upon performance generally provide for fee payments to the company based on changes in the client hospital s market share of diabetes inpatients  the costs of providing care to these patients  and quality of care measurements 
the company has renewed or entered into new contracts in recent years that included primarily fixed management fee arrangements 
the terms of hospital contracts generally range from two to five years and are subject to periodic renegotiation and renewal that may include reduction in fee structures which have a negative impact on the company s revenues and profitability 
the form of these contracts includes various structures ranging from arrangements where all costs of the company s program for center professional personnel and community relations are the responsibility of the company to structures where all company program costs are the responsibility of the client hospital 
the company is paid directly by the hospital 
patients receiving services from the diabetes treatment centers are charged by the hospital for typical hospital services 
under the terms of its contracts with hospitals  the company provides the resources that enable the hospital to develop and operate an integrated system of care for patients with diabetes that includes programs to work with physicians to identify objectives for the patient and monitor accomplishment of the objectives during the patient s stay  clinical interventions for patients with diabetes  an information network service that connects the hospital to the company s dedicated nationwide resources  programs for specific activities related to quality improvement  cost reduction and market share increases for patients with diabetes  and programs to monitor the hospital s performance against quality indicators and processes related to diabetes patients 
also available for hospital customers are numerous other services such as outpatient diabetes patient education and follow up  programs for diabetes during pregnancy and programs for insulin pump therapy  and policies and procedures to help ensure formal recognition of the diabetes program at the hospital by the american diabetes association 

table of contents the company s hospital based diabetes treatment center business had contracts in effect in states at august  the company also had a contract to operate one hospital based arthritis and osteoporosis treatment center during fiscal and  this contract was discontinued during fiscal the following table presents the number of total hospital contracts in effect during the past three fiscal years year ended august  contracts in effect at beginning of period contracts signed contracts discontinued contracts in effect at end of period hospital sites where services are delivered during fiscal  hospital contracts were renewed 
several of these renewals included contract rate reductions  which the company has undertaken to maintain long term contractual relationships 
also during fiscal  seven hospital contracts were discontinued 
there were no material continuing obligations or costs for the company associated with the termination of any client hospital contracts 
the company anticipates that continued hospital industry pressures to reduce costs because of constrained revenues will result in a continuation of contract rate reductions and the potential for additional contract terminations 
during fiscal  contracts are either subject to expiration if not renewed or have early cancellation provisions that could result in contract termination 
the company s strategy is to develop additional relationships with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement services and to further develop and expand its hospital based diabetes treatment center business 
the company anticipates that it will utilize its state of the art central operating unit call center and medical information technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering its health plan disease management services 
in addition  the company has announced its plans to add services to its product mix for health plans that will extend the company s programs beyond its current chronic disease focus and will be designed to provide care enhancement services to individuals identified with one or more of a number of additional diseases or conditions or who are at risk for these diseases or conditions 
the company believes that significant cost savings and improvements in care can result from addressing care management and treatment requirements for these additional selected diseases and conditions and will enable the company to address a much larger percent of a health plan s total healthcare costs 
the company anticipates that significant costs will be incurred during fiscal in the development of the clinical programs  the associated information technology support for these expanded care enhancement initiatives and the opening of additional central operating unit call centers and that many of these costs will be incurred prior to the initiation of revenues from contracts for these new programs 
it is also anticipated that some of these new capabilities and technologies may be added through strategic alliances with other entities and that the company may choose to make minority interest investments in or to acquire for stock or cash one or more of these entities 
at a special meeting of stockholders on october   the stockholders approved i an amendment to the company s restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the company s common stock from  to  and ii an amendment of one of the company s stock plans to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plan  to increase the number of shares issuable to any officer  key employee or consultant in any one year and to extend the term of the plan

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues of million from to resulted primarily from an increase in the average number of equivalent lives enrolled in the company s health plan disease management contracts to approximately  for from approximately  for this increase in the average number of equivalent lives under management was primarily the result of new health plan contracts signed during fiscal and the average revenue per member per month for enrollees under the company s health plan contracts for was greater than for this increase in average per member per month revenue occurred primarily as a result of an increase in equivalent lives under higher rate contracts in the fiscal period when compared with the fiscal period  improved performance under the terms of performance fee provisions of health plan contracts  revenues recognized during the periods associated with final settlement and transition services on two health plan contracts that terminated during the second and third quarters of fiscal and the positive effect of health plan contract revenue adjustments of approximately million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal the increase in health plan contract revenues was offset partially by decreased revenues from hospital based diabetes treatment center contracts 
revenues from the company s hospital contract operations for were less than for on slightly higher average number of contracts in operation during as compared with average revenue per hospital contract was approximately lower in than in due primarily to contract fee reductions and to a higher percentage of relatively newer contracts in with somewhat lower fees compared with the company anticipates that revenues for fiscal will increase over fiscal revenues primarily as a result of additional lives enrolled under its existing and anticipated new health plan contracts which may be offset somewhat by lower revenues from hospital contract operations resulting from contract fee reductions and contract terminations
