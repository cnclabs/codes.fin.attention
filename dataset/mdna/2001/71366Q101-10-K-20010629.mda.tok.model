overview we are a leading global provider of infrastructure resource management applications  employee relationship management solutions  and e commerce technologies and services 
our infrastructure management group provides software  technologies  and services to optimize and manage the procurement  maintenance  and disposition of business infrastructure 
in addition  it offers employee self service products designed to improve employee productivity and lower costs by providing employees direct access to corporate resources and infrastructure 
our e markets group provides a suite of business to business software products and services to facilitate the processes of selling and purchasing direct goods among trading partners 
in april  we announced the creation of our integrated solutions group 
this division is intended to focus our sales efforts to our alliance partners and to large multinational corporations with both infrastructure management and e business software requirements 
we believe our major alliance partners  comprised of worldwide consulting firms  managed service providers  and system integrators  exert substantial influence over the purchase decisions of large enterprise customers 
accordingly  a principal objective of our integrated services group is to strengthen our relationships with existing partners and to expand our network to include new partners 
until recently  our products focused principally on problem management for an organization s information technology infrastructure 
historically  our principal product suite has been servicecenter  an integrated  enterprise service desk software solution that assists information technology departments in managing and maintaining internal computer networks and related assets 
during fiscal  we determined that our customers required a more comprehensive solution to manage their infrastructure assets  including information technology assets but also the numerous other assets that make up business infrastructures 
through acquisitions and internal development  we have expanded the breadth and functionality of our products for managing information technology assets 
in addition  we made a number of acquisitions intended to broaden our infrastructure management product suite beyond management of network help desks 
since  we acquired new product lines relating  among others  to asset management  facilities management  corporate fleet management  rail management  telecommunications management  and network discovery 
in addition to acquiring technologies and products through acquisitions  we have also focused substantial resources on internal product and technology development 
our employee self service procurement product  get it  was developed internally and introduced in late to assist companies in automating their internal asset procurement and employee self service processes 
in june  we completed the acquisition of harbinger corporation 
harbinger s business focused historically on providing electronic commerce software that facilitates the exchange of electronic data between businesses 
prior to the acquisition  however  revenues for harbinger s legacy software business were declining 
at the time of the acquisition  harbinger began to focus its business on creating and managing web based catalogs of supplies and materials and on maintaining and hosting vertical market exchanges for supply and commodity markets in the automotive  energy  industrial component and retail industries 
our e markets group is comprised largely of harbinger s legacy software business and newer e commerce businesses 
we have integrated substantial aspects of harbinger s connectivity and marketplace technologies in our infrastructure management group 
in particular  we recently integrated the connectivity  data transformation  catalog creation and management  and transaction assurance technologies acquired from harbinger with our infrastructure management products and solutions 
we intend to use these technologies to deliver services to suppliers of infrastructure assets and infrastructure marketplaces and to enable electronic exchanges for infrastructure assets 
harbinger s revenue growth rates were substantially lower than peregrine s historic revenue growth rates as a result  in part  of declining revenues in harbinger s legacy software business that were not offset by increased revenues from new business lines 
as a result  we expect our future revenue growth rates will be less than historical rates  and predicting our future operating results will be difficult as we continue our efforts to integrate and streamline harbinger s operations and businesses 
in addition  as part of continuing strategic review of our businesses  we have determined to de emphasize and discontinue certain businesses of harbinger that we do not believe are strategic to the combined company 
in september  we completed the sale of one of harbinger s product lines and may determine to sell or discontinue other harbinger products or businesses in the future 
we expect this recent divestiture and any future discontinuations or divestitures to result in revenue reductions that may not be offset by revenues from other sources 
during our fiscal year  our ability to maintain revenue growth rates estimated by market analysts was attributable principally to the relative strength of our infrastructure management group 
we cannot predict whether this trend will continue  and any weakness in our infrastructure management business could result in our revenue growth rates  revenues  or operating results being less than expected 
our revenues are derived principally from product licensing and services 
license fees are generally due upon the granting of the license and typically include a one year warranty period as part of the license agreement 
services revenues are comprised of fees for maintenance post contract support  professional services consulting  network services and training 
we provide ongoing maintenance services  priced and sold separately from our other products  which include technical support and product enhancements  for an annual fee based upon the current price of the product 
network fees consist of monthly access charges and transaction based usage charges for our e commerce transaction processing services 
we also derive revenues from transaction fees  subscription fees  and maintenance fees associated with our e markets group 
we anticipate that  as a percentage of total revenues  subscription fees associated with sales of our applications on a hosted basis will increase in future periods  particularly in our e markets group and to a lesser extent in our infrastructure management group 
the hosted service provider model is relatively new and unproven for us  and we do not know whether it will prove financially attractive relative to our historic license revenue model 
we expect that increasing sales of our products on a hosted subscription basis will result in slower revenue growth rates 
under a subscription model  we will receive monthly payments for our services ratably over the term of a subscription  typically three to five years 
under our current license model  we primarily sell our software in return for the up front payment of a license fee 
revenues from direct and indirect license agreements are recognized  provided that all of the following conditions are met a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable  risk of concession is deemed remote  and no other significant vendor obligations exist 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the support period  generally one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services most often performed on a time and materials basis under separate service agreements for the installation of our products 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the respective services are performed 
transaction and subscription fees are recognized monthly as services are provided 
we currently derive a substantial portion of our license revenues from the sale of our infrastructure management applications and from our business connectivity software products in our e markets group 
we expect these products to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of our infrastructure resource management and business connectivity strategies and applications  including future product enhancements  and on the development of a market for our asset procurement products 
in particular  a substantial majority of our license revenues are attributable to three infrastructure management product suites servicecenter  assetcenter  and facilitycenter 
substantially all of our license revenues are derived from granting a non exclusive perpetual license to use our products 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our infrastructure procurement and resource management applications  such as competition or technological change  manner of distribution or licensing  and related methods of revenue recognition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  our license revenue growth has become increasingly dependent on the successful completion of one or more large license transactions during a given quarter 
as a result  failure to complete one or more of these transactions by quarter end could have a material adverse effect on our license revenue  total revenue  and operating results 
recent acquisition announcement on june   we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement under which we would acquire all the outstanding shares of remedy corporation  a supplier of information technology service management and customer relationship management solutions 
the acquisition is subject to approval by remedy s stockholders  regulatory approvals  and customary closing conditions 
if the merger is completed  we will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of remedy 
each outstanding share of remedy common stock will be exchanged for in cash and shares of our common stock 
in addition  we will assume options outstanding under remedy s employee stock incentive plans 
excluding assumed options and based on remedy s outstanding common stock as of june  we expect to issue approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with the merger and to pay remedy stockholders an aggregate cash consideration of approximately million 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues 
march  statement of operations data revenues licenses services total revenues cost and expenses cost of licenses cost of services amortization of purchased technology sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition costs and other total costs and expenses loss from operations before interest net and income tax expense interest income expense  net loss from operations before income tax expense income tax expense net loss comparison of fiscal years ended march   and revenues revenues 
total revenues were million  million and million for fiscal year end  and  respectively  representing period to period increases of and for the fiscal and periods  respectively 
the reasons for the revenue increases are more fully discussed below 
licenses 
license revenues were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  representing of total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal total license revenues increased and period to period for fiscal and  respectively 
the increases in license revenues are primarily attributable to increased demand for new and additional licenses of our infrastructure resource management applications 
we believe license revenues will fluctuate period to period in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
in recent periods  our revenues and revenue growth rates have become increasingly dependent on our ability to complete one or more particularly large license transactions with a major enterprise customer 
we expect larger transaction sizes from a limited number of customers to account for a large percentage of license revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors that would have an adverse effect on technology investments by large enterprise customers would also tend to adversely affect our future revenues  revenue growth rates  and operating results 
investors are encouraged to review the section entitled factors that may affect our business  financial condition  and future operating results  beginning on page of this report  for further discussion of these risks 
the majority of our products are distributed through our direct sales organization 
the balance is derived through indirect sales channels and alliance partners  including value added resellers and systems integrators 
we believe that our alliance partners are particularly important in influencing the purchase decisions of our largest enterprise customers 
revenues derived through indirect sales channels now comprise a significant portion of our total license revenues 
we have substantially less ability to manage our sales through indirect channels and less visibility about our partners success in selling the products that they have purchased from us 
to the extent indirect sales continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues  we could experience unforeseen variability in our future revenues and operating results if our partners are unable to sell our products 
on occasion  we purchase goods or services for our operations from certain limited vendors at or about the same time we license our software to these organizations 
these transactions are separately negotiated and recorded at terms we consider to be arms length 
services 
services revenues consist of support  consulting and training services 
services revenues were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively  representing of total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal total services revenues increased and period to period for fiscal and  respectively 
the dollar increases in service revenues are primarily attributable to maintenance  consulting  and training related to the maintenance  implementation  and use of our software from license agreements and related expansion 
while these revenues are increasing in absolute dollars  we expect service revenues to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues 
costs and expenses cost of licenses 
cost of licenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  each representing less than of total revenues in these periods 
cost of software licenses primarily consists of third party software royalties  product packaging  documentation and production 
these costs are expected to remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues 
cost of services 
cost of services were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
cost of services primarily consists of personnel  facilities  and system costs in providing support  consulting and training services 
the dollar increases are primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs in order to support the related activities 
cost of services as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from fiscal to fiscal  principally because license revenues grew at a faster rate than service revenues 
amortization of purchased technology 
amortization of purchased technology was million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increases are primarily due to the acquisitions we made during fiscal year sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consists of personnel related costs  facilities and system costs and travel and entertainment 
the dollar increases in sales and marketing expenses are primarily attributable to the significant expansion of both the north american and international sales and marketing forces 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts and establish additional sales offices around the world 
if we experience a decrease in sales force productivity or for any other reason a decline in revenues  it is likely that our operating margins will decline as well 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
research and development expenses primarily consists of personnel related costs 
the dollar increases in research and development are primarily attributable to an increase in the number of personnel conducting research and development associated with new product initiatives  and the integration of acquired software and multiple applications 
these costs are expected to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
general and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee salaries and overhead for administrative personnel 
the dollar increases in general and administrative are primarily attributable to an increase in the number of personnel to support our growth 
acquisition costs and other 
acquisition costs and other were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
acquisition costs and other consist of impairment charges  amortization of intangibles  acquired in process research and development costs and other acquisition related items 
the increase in fiscal relative to prior years is attributable primarily to our june acquisition of harbinger  our largest to date 
during fiscal  we wrote off million of related assets related primarily to an acquisition made in our e markets group segment and investments made in our infrastructure management segment 
we will continue to monitor the value of such assets in the future and may have future such impairment charges 
the remaining dollar and percentage increases principally relate to our and acquisitions 
provision for income taxes income tax expenses were million  million and million for fiscal year  and  respectively 
this increase in absolute dollars is attributable to an increase in taxable income 
excluding the effect on net income of acquisition costs  our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
these costs are expected to increase in absolute dollars but remain consistent as a percentage of operating profits 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased to million as of march  from million as of march  this increase is primarily attributable to our issuance during fiscal of convertible subordinated notes due in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes provide for annual aggregate interest payments of  payable semi annually in arrears 
during july  we entered into a million senior credit facility for a term of three years with a syndicate of financial institutions 
the facility is available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions 
as of march   there were no amounts outstanding with respect to this facility 
on june  we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement under which we would acquire all the outstanding shares of remedy corporation  a supplier of information technology service management and customer relationship management solutions 
this acquisition is subject to approval by remedy s stockholders  regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 
based on remedy s outstanding shares as of june   we expect to pay out approximately million as cash merger consideration 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and remedy corporation had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
as a result of the acquisition  we would acquire all remedy s cash and cash equivalents as of the date of the merger 
we currently expect these amounts  together with our anticipated cash flows from operations  to be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next months 
nevertheless  in anticipation of the use of cash for payment to remedy stockholders in the merger and to ensure adequate levels of working capital for the combined company after the merger  we are considering establishing a new bank facility or facilities 
we may also consider in the future additional financing in the form of issuances of our common stock or the issuance of debt securities  including debt securities convertible into shares of our common stock 
additional financing may take the form of issuances of our common stock or the issuance of debt securities  including debt securities convertible into shares of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available when and as required on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  the issuance of additional equity securities  including securities convertible into our equity securities  would dilute the interests of our existing stockholders 
issuance of additional debt securities could impair our financial condition as we become increasingly leveraged  and interest payments would be expected to have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in connection with our acquisition of harbinger  we assumed the defense of an outstanding shareholder class action lawsuit against harbinger and several of its former officers and directors 
harbinger did not maintain directors and officers liability insurance to cover any liability resulting from this lawsuit  and peregrine s insurance will not cover any liability of harbinger or its former officers or directors resulting from the lawsuit 
in october  we entered into an agreement in principle to settle this class action lawsuit 
if the settlement is finalized and approved by the court  we will be required to make an aggregate cash payment of million to a class of former shareholders of harbinger in exchange for dismissal of all claims against harbinger 
although the parties to the litigation have agreed in principle to this settlement  final settlement is subject to further documentation  various contingencies  and approval by the court 
the court may not approve the settlement 
if the court does not approve the settlement  the plaintiffs in the lawsuit may proceed with their claims  without prejudice 
it is also possible that if the settlement is approved by the court  claims could be pursued by class members who opt out of the class settlement by filing appropriate notices with the court 
if the litigation were to continue to proceed  we could be required to spend substantial sums in an effort to litigate this matter 
continued litigation would be likely to result in a diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations 
if the litigation were decided adversely to harbinger  or we agree in the future to settle this litigation for a substantial sum as a result of failure to obtain court approval of the pending settlement or for any other reason  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
please refer to the section captioned factors that may affect our business  financial condition  and future operating results for a more detailed description of the risks associated with this lawsuit 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk other than forward rate currency contracts described below  which are used for hedging our foreign currency risk  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts and contracts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
we conduct business overseas in a number of foreign currencies  principally in europe 
during our fiscal year ended march   declines in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar had an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
although we currently derive no material revenues from highly inflationary economies  we are expanding our presence in international markets outside europe  including the pacific rim and latin america  whose currencies have fluctuated in value relative to the us dollar more than european currencies 
there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
currently  we attempt to mitigate our transaction currency risks through our foreign exchange hedging program 
the hedging program consists primarily of using forward rate currency contracts of approximately one month in length to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
to the extent not properly hedged by obligations denominated in local currencies  our foreign operations remain subject to the risks of future foreign currency fluctuations  and there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against such risk 
in the fall of  the technology driven nasdaq stock market began a steep decline in stock prices particularly in the e commerce sectors 
in early  it became apparent to us that the downturn was other than temporary 
in addition  it became apparent that technology spending  particularly in the e commerce and enterprise resource planning environments  would drop sharply in accordingly  we determined a sfas triggering event had occurred related to certain of our tangible and intangible assets 
we prepared analyses such as cash flow projections related to these tangible and intangible assets and as a result determined that certain assets had been impaired 
we wrote these assets  along with any allocated goodwill  down to fair value based on the related discounted cash flows and similar evidence 
during  we wrote off million of impaired intangibles  investments and other assets related primarily to an acquisition made in our e markets group segment and investments made in our infrastructure management group segment 
we will continue to monitor the value of these assets in the future and may have future such impairment charges

factors that may affect our business  financial condition  and future operating results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other information are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results  including the following we have a history of losses  expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future  and cannot assure that we will be profitable in the future on an operating basis or otherwise 
we have incurred substantial losses in recent years  and predicting our future operating results is difficult 
if we continue to incur losses  if our revenues decline or grow at a slower rate  or if our expenses increase without commensurate increases in revenues  our operating results will suffer and the price of our common stock may fall 
through march   we had recorded cumulative net losses of approximately million  mainly comprised of acquisition costs related to the acquisitions completed since late we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  substantial expenses associated with acquisition related costs  and amortization of goodwill and other intangible costs will result in our continuing to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we do not believe recent revenue growth rates are sustainable in the future or indicative of future growth rates 
if our revenue growth rates slow or our revenues decline  our operating results could be seriously impaired because many of our expenses are fixed and cannot be easily or quickly changed 
a reduction in our revenue growth rate and or an impairment of our financial results could lead to a dramatic decline in our stock price 
our revenues are not predictable and vary significantly from quarter to quarter for numerous reasons beyond our control 
quarter to quarter variations could result in a substantial decrease in our stock price if our revenues or operating results are less than market analysts anticipate 
our revenues or operating results in a given quarter could be substantially less than anticipated by market analysts  which could result in a substantial decline in our stock price 
in addition  quarter to quarter variations could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of our business  which could also result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary from quarter to quarter for many reasons beyond our control  including those described in this section 
as a result  our quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
our revenue growth is increasingly dependent on a small number of large license transactions 
our revenues in a given quarter could be adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more large license agreements  if the completion of a large license agreement is delayed  or if the contract terms were to prevent us from recognizing revenue during that quarter 
our revenue growth in recent periods has been attributable in part to an increase in the number of large license transactions sold to a limited number of large  enterprise customers during a given period 
for the year ended march   sales to one of our customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we expect our reliance on these large transactions with a limited number of customers to continue for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to complete one or more large license transactions by the end of a particular quarter  our revenues and operating results could be materially below the expectations of market analysts  and our stock price could fall 
in particular  our dependence on a few relatively large license transactions could have an adverse effect on our quarterly revenues or revenue growth rates to the extent we are unable to complete a large license transaction because a large prospective customer determines to reduce its capital investments in technology in response to slowing economic growth 
when negotiating large software licenses  many customers time their negotiations near quarter end in an effort to improve their ability to negotiate more favorable pricing terms 
as a result  we recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a quarter  and license revenues in a given quarter depend substantially on orders booked during the last month or weeks of a quarter 
if we are unable to complete a sufficient number of license agreements during this short and intense sales period  our revenues could be substantially below the expectations of market analysts  and our stock price could decline 
our quarterly and annual revenue and revenue growth rates may be affected if our distribution partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or if we are unsuccessful in adding new distribution partners 
many of our transactions are sourced  developed  and closed through our strategic and distribution partners  including resellers and system integrators 
we believe that these transaction partners are extremely important influencers of customer purchase decisions  particularly purchase decisions by large  enterprise customers 
if the number or size of our partner influenced transactions were to decrease for any reason  our revenue growth rates and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
if our sales through these indirect channels  or to new distributors  resellers  or strategic partners  were to decrease in a given quarter  our total revenues and operating results could be harmed 
sales through indirect channels  including distributors  third party resellers  and system integrators  represent a significant percentage of our total sales  and this percentage has increased in recent periods 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
as a result  we could experience a shortfall in our revenues  or a substantial decline in our rate of revenue growth  if sales through these channels were to decrease or were to increase at a slower rate than recently experienced 
we have less ability to manage sales through indirect channels  relative to direct sales  and less visibility about our partners success in selling our products 
in addition  many of our distribution arrangements are non exclusive  and these distributors may carry competing products 
as a result  we could experience unforeseen variability in our revenues and operating results for a number of reasons  including the following inability of our partners to sell our products  a decision by our partners to favor competing products  or inability of our partners to manage the timing of their purchases from us against their sales to end users  resulting in inventories of unsold licenses held by partners 
our quarterly and annual revenues and revenue growth rates are dependent on the budgeting cycles and investment cycles of our customers 
our quarter to quarter revenues will depend on customer budgeting cycles 
if customers change their budgeting cycles  or reduce their capital spending on technology  our revenues could decline 
many analysts predict substantially slower growth rates for  and potential reductions in  information technology capital investment in and potentially continuing in moreover  many software companies  including peregrine  have experienced increasing reluctance by customers to make substantial investments in new technologies 
to the extent these projections prove accurate  we expect our quarterly revenues and operating results will be adversely affected 
for example  quarter to quarter sales of our get it e procurement application fell for the first time since the product s introduction in the third quarter of fiscal as e procurement applications proved more sensitive to the downturn in capital spending than our other flagship infrastructure management products 
moreover  during this downturn  we have been highly dependent on our servicecenter  assetcenter and facilitycenter product lines to maintain our revenue growth rates  and we expect our dependence on these product lines to continue 
if the capital investment downturn continues or worsens  we may experience reduced demand for these core products as well  which could have a material and adverse effect on our revenues  operating results  financial condition  and stock price 
most software companies  including peregrine  currently have very limited visibility with respect to their near term quarters and are having difficulty predicting their revenues and operating results during these periods 
our quarterly and annual revenues and revenue growth rates could be affected by new products we announce or that our competitors announce 
announcements of new products or releases by us or our competitors could cause customers to delay purchases pending the introduction of the new product or release 
in addition  announcements by us or our competitors concerning pricing policies could have an adverse effect on our revenues in a given quarter 
our products have different margins  and changes in our product mix could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
changes in our product mix could adversely affect our operating results because some products provide higher margins than others 
for example  margins on software licenses tend to be higher than margins on maintenance and services 
cancellations of licenses  subscriptions  or maintenance contracts could reduce our revenues and could adversely affect our operating results 
in particular  our maintenance contracts with customers terminate on an annual basis 
substantial cancellations of maintenance or subscription agreements  or a substantial failure to renew these contracts  would reduce our revenues and impact our operating results 
the long sales cycle for our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
delays in customer orders could result in our revenues being substantially below the expectations of market analysts 
our customers planning and purchase decisions involve a significant commitment of resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
as a result  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses during a particular period in an effort to obtain orders 
if we are unsuccessful in generating offsetting revenues during that period  our revenues and earnings could be substantially reduced  or we could experience a large loss 
the sales cycle for our products typically takes four to nine months to complete  and we may experience delays that further extend this period 
the length of the sales cycle may be extended beyond four to nine months due to factors over which we have little or no control  including the size of the transaction and the level of competition we encounter 
the average size of our license transactions has increased in recent periods as we have generated an increasingly larger percentage of our revenues from a limited number of large  enterprise customers 
this trend  should it continue  could have the effect of further extending our sales cycle 
during our sales cycle  we typically provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products may result in periodic reductions in our revenues and impairment of our operating results 
seasonality in our business could result in our revenues in a given period being less than market estimates 
seasonality could also result in quarter to quarter decreases in our revenues 
in either of these events  seasonality could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
historically  our revenues and operating results in our december quarter have tended to benefit  relative to our june and september quarters  from purchase decisions made by the large concentration of our customers with calendar year end budgeting requirements 
our june and september quarters tend to be our weakest 
revenues and operating results in the march quarter have tended to benefit from the efforts of our sales force to meet fiscal year end sales quotas 
notwithstanding these seasonal factors  other factors  including those identified in this section  could still result in reduced revenues or operating results in our december and march quarters 
for example  we may not experience the typical increase in demand in our december quarter if the downturn in capital spending and technology investment continues through the end of or beyond 
in addition  our pending acquisition of remedy corporation could have an adverse effect on revenues during these periods if customers defer purchases as a result of uncertainty about the merger or in order to determine how peregrine and remedy will integrate their product lines 
in addition  historical patterns may change over time  particularly as our operations become larger and the sources of our revenue change or become more diverse 
for example  our international operations have expanded significantly in recent years  particularly in europe 
we also have an international presence in the pacific rim and latin america 
we may experience variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in these foreign markets 
as an example  our september quarter is typically weaker in part due to the european summer holiday season 
our june acquisition of harbinger corporation may reduce our revenue growth rates and make prediction of our future revenues and operating results more difficult as we integrate our businesses and attempt to focus the strategic model of the combined company 
harbinger s revenues prior to the acquisition were growing at a substantially slower rate than our revenues  due in large part to declining revenues for harbinger s legacy electronic commerce software business 
if our efforts to refocus harbinger s business and integrate it with that of peregrine are not successful  our future revenue growth rates could be substantially less than our historic growth rates  and our future revenues and operating results could be impaired 
we have already begun to de emphasize and discontinue certain businesses of harbinger that we do not believe are strategic to the combined company 
in september  we completed the sale of one of harbinger s product lines  and we may sell or discontinue other harbinger products or businesses in the future 
we expect this recent divestiture and any future discontinuations or divestitures will result in revenue reductions that may not be offset by revenues from other sources 
in particular  our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected from the acquisition and subsequent integration processes for a number of reasons  including the following revenues for harbinger s e commerce software products may continue to decline  and we may not be able to offset these declines with increased revenues from our infrastructure management or other product lines 
harbinger s web based supply catalog and vertical supply businesses are still in their early stages  and a sustainable market may not develop for these services as offered by our e markets group 
harbinger and some of its former officers and directors are defendants in shareholder litigation for which neither peregrine nor harbinger is insured 
the outcome of this litigation  if determined adversely to harbinger  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in september  a complaint was filed against harbinger and some of its then current and former officers and directors in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia 
the complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented or omitted material facts in violation of federal securities laws 
an amended complaint was filed in march  expanding upon the allegations of the initial complaint by  among other things  alleging accounting improprieties 
the complaint relates to actions by harbinger during the period from february to october harbinger did not maintain directors and officers liability insurance during this period 
as a result  we are not insured with respect to any potential liability of harbinger or any officer or director of harbinger 
harbinger was  however  obligated under agreements with each of its officers and directors to indemnify them for the costs incurred in connection with defending themselves against this litigation and is obligated to indemnify them to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law if they are held liable 
in connection with the acquisition  we agreed to honor these contractual arrangements 
in october  we entered into an agreement in principle to settle this class action lawsuit 
if the settlement is finalized and approved by the court  we will be required to make an aggregate cash payment of million to a class of former shareholders of harbinger in exchange for dismissal of all claims against harbinger 
although the parties to the litigation have agreed in principle to this settlement  final settlement is subject to further documentation  various contingencies  and approval by the court 
the court may not approve the settlement 
if the court does not approve the settlement  the plaintiffs in the lawsuit may proceed with their claims without prejudice 
it is also possible that  if the settlement is approved by the court  claims could be pursued by class members who opt out of the class settlement by filing appropriate notices with the court 
if the litigation were to continue to proceed  we could be required to spend substantial sums in an effort to litigate this matter 
continued litigation would be likely to result in a diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations 
if the litigation were decided adversely to harbinger  or if we were to agree in the future to settle this litigation for a substantial sum as a result of failure to obtain court approval of the pending settlement or for any other reason  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we could experience losses as a result of our strategic investments 
if our strategic investments in other companies are not successful  we could incur losses 
we have made and expect to continue to make minority investments in companies with businesses or technologies that we consider to be complementary to our business or technologies 
these investments have generally been made by issuing shares of our common stock or  to a lesser extent  paying cash 
many of these investments are in companies whose operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as profitable concerns 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in our incurring losses or our being unable to recover the carrying value of our investments 
for example  during fiscal  we recognized impairment charges totalling million  associated principally with impairment of acquired assets but to a lesser extent with strategic investments 
we will continue to monitor the value of these investments  and may have additional impairment charges in the future 
our business and operating results will be harmed if we cannot compete effectively against other companies in our markets 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and diverse  and the technologies for our products can change rapidly 
new products are introduced frequently and existing products are continually enhanced 
we face competition from a number of sources in the markets for our infrastructure resource management  procurement and e business connectivity solutions 
we face competition from numerous companies that offer products that compete with one or more of our products and services 
with respect to our infrastructure management products  these competitors include software companies as well as information technology and system management companies  such as applix  blue ocean  computer associates  control software a division of csi maximus  frontrange  hewlett packard  ibm  intraware  main control  microsoft  mro software formerly project software and development inc  network associates  nortel  peoplesoft  remedy  and royal blue technologies 
in the markets served by our e commerce enablement technology  we face competition from providers of customer relationship portals  such as aspect communications  providers of catalog management solutions  such as requisite technology  providers of e commerce enablement software such as webmethods  and providers of legacy e commerce technology and services such as sbc communications  through its acquisition of sterling commerce  and general electric exchange solutions 
in the markets for employee relationship management products  including procurement and e procurement solutions  we face competition from established providers of business to business internet commerce solutions such as ariba and commerceone  established providers of enterprise resource planning software such as oracle and sap  and numerous start up and other entrepreneurial companies offering products that provide one or more aspects of employee relationship management such as self help service offerings  or web based knowledge management systems 
if we cannot compete effectively in our markets by offering products that are comparable in functionality  ease of use and price to those of our competitors  our revenues will decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products  and they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
additional competition from new entrepreneurial companies or established companies entering our markets could have an adverse effect on our business  revenues and operating results 
in addition  alliances among companies that are not currently direct competitors could create new competitors with substantial market presence 
because few barriers to entry exist in the software industry  we anticipate additional competition from new and established companies as well as business alliances 
we expect that the software industry will continue to consolidate 
in particular  we expect that large software companies will continue to acquire or establish alliances with our smaller competitors  thereby increasing the resources available to those competitors 
these new competitors or alliances could rapidly acquire significant market share at our expense 
we may experience integration or other problems with new acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
new acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
in addition to the acquisition of harbinger  we have made a number of acquisitions of businesses and technologies over the last three years  and we expect to continue to make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we are frequently in formal or informal discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
accordingly  we may in the future make acquisitions of  or large investments in  businesses that offer products  services and technologies that we believe would complement our products or services 
we may also make acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels 
even though we announce an acquisition  we may not be able to complete it 
any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks 
the following are examples of these risks difficulty in combining the technology  operations or work force of the acquired business  disruption of our on going business  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel  and impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill  and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we expect that future acquisitions could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if the consideration for the transaction were paid in common stock  this would further dilute our existing stockholders 
in addition  we may raise additional equity or debt capital to finance cash acquisitions 
raising additional equity capital would further dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  and additional debt could impair our operating results and financial condition 
additional financing may not be available when and as needed on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if an inability to obtain financing were to preclude us from making an acquisition or completing a previously announced acquisition  our future operating results could be adversely affected  and our stock price could fall 
in june  we announced our proposed acquisition of remedy corporation 
for additional factors related to that pending transaction  please refer to the additional information under the caption additional risks associated with our pending acquisition of remedy corporation beginning on page of this report 
our future revenues and operating results may be adversely affected if the software application market continues to evolve toward a subscription based model  which may prove less profitable for us 
we expect our revenue growth rates and operating results to be adversely affected as customers require us to offer our products under a subscription based application service provider model 
historically  we have sold our infrastructure management solutions on a perpetual license basis in exchange for an up front license fee 
customers are increasingly attempting to reduce their up front capital expenditures by purchasing software applications under a hosted subscription service model 
under the hosted model  the customer subscribes to use an application from the software provider 
the application is generally hosted on a server managed by the software provider or a third party hosting service 
we expect that a substantial portion of future revenues generated by our e markets group will be realized under a subscription based model 
we also expect that an increasing portion of future revenues generated by our infrastructure management group may be represented by subscriptions 
under the subscription revenue model  we generally will recognize revenue and receive payment ratably over the term of a customer s subscription 
as a result  our rates of revenue growth under a subscription model may be less than our historical rates under a license model 
in addition  the price of our services will be fixed at the time of entering into the subscription agreement 
if we are unable to adequately predict the costs associated with maintaining and servicing a customer s subscription  then the periodic expenses associated with a subscription may exceed the revenues we recognize for the subscription in the same period  which would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we are not successful in implementing the subscription revenue model  or if market analysts or investors do not believe that the model is attractive relative to our traditional license model  our business could be impaired  and our stock price could decline dramatically 
if we  or third parties on which we will rely  are unable to adequately deliver our internet based applications  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we currently use our own servers to deliver our internet based products to customers 
we have  however  entered into agreements with a third party to provide a full complement of services that will enable us to outsource the delivery of these internet based products to our customers 
for example  our third party service providers will manage the application servers  maintain communications equipment  manage the network data centers where our software and data will be stored  and provide client support 
if we are unable to adequately deliver our internet based applications  we may lose customers or be unable to attract new customers  which would adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  the third party service providers that we engage may not deliver adequate support or service to our clients  which may harm our reputation and our business 
because these third party service providers handle the installation of the computer and communications equipment and software needed for the day to day operations of our internet based applications  we will be dependent on them to manage  maintain and provide adequate security for customer applications 
if our customers experience any delays in response time or performance problems while using our internet applications  as hosted by a third party or by us  our customers may perceive the delays as defects with our products and may stop using our applications  which would adversely affect our revenues 
we have limited experience outsourcing these services and may have difficulty managing this process 
we will be required to monitor our third party service providers to ensure that they perform these services adequately 
in addition  if we do not maintain good relations with these third party service providers  or if they go out of business  they may be unable to perform critical support functions for us 
if we were unable to find replacement third party service providers  we would be required to perform these functions ourselves 
we may not be successful in obtaining or performing these services on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards  or do not continually develop products that meet the complex and evolving needs of our customers  sales of our products may decrease 
as a result of rapid technological change in our industry  our competitive position in existing markets  or in markets we may enter in the future  can be eroded rapidly by product advances and technological changes 
we may be unable to improve the performance and features of our products as necessary to respond to these developments 
in addition  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance depend in part on our ability to improve existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer needs  and respond to competitive products 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
in addition  competitive or technological developments may require us to make substantial  unanticipated investments in new products and technologies  and we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified sales personnel  software developers  and customer service personnel  we will not be able to sell and support our products 
competition for qualified employees is intense  particularly in the technology industry  and we have in the past experienced difficulty recruiting qualified employees 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel  software developers  and customer service personnel  our revenue growth rates could decrease  or our revenues could decline  and our operating results could be materially harmed 
our products and services require a sophisticated selling effort targeted at several key people within a prospective customer s organization 
this process requires the efforts of experienced sales personnel as well as specialized consulting professionals 
in addition  the complexity of our products  and issues associated with installing and maintaining them  require highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we intend to hire a significant number of these personnel in the future and train them in the use of our products 
we believe our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain these key employees 
if immigration laws limit our ability to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries  our business and operating results could be harmed 
limitations under united states immigration laws could prevent us from recruiting skilled technical personnel from foreign countries  which could harm our business if we do not have sufficient personnel to develop new products and respond to technological changes 
this inability to hire technical personnel could lead to future decreases in our revenues or decreases in our revenue growth rates  either of which would adversely affect our operating results 
because of severe shortages for qualified technical personnel in the united states  many companies  including peregrine  have recruited engineers and other technical personnel from foreign countries 
foreign computer professionals such as those we have employed typically become eligible for employment in the united states by obtaining a nonimmigrant visa 
the number of nonimmigrant visas is limited annually by federal immigration laws 
in recent years  despite increases in the number of available visas  the annual allocation has been exhausted well before year end 
our business could be harmed if we lost the services of one or more members of our senior management team 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or the decision of one or more of these individuals to join a competitor  could adversely affect our business and harm our operating results and financial condition 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and other key sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
none of our senior management is bound by an employment or non competition agreement 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
if we fail to manage expansion effectively  this will place a significant strain on our management and operational resources 
our recent growth rates  together with integration efforts resulting from our numerous acquisitions  have placed a significant strain on our management and operational resources 
we have expanded the size and geographic scope of our operations rapidly in recent years  both internally and through acquisitions  and intend to continue to expand in order to pursue market opportunities that our management believes are attractive 
our customer relationships could be strained if we are unable to devote sufficient resources to them as a result of our growth  which could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and operating results 
we may be unable to expand our business and increase our revenues if we are unable to expand our distribution channels 
if we are unable to expand our distribution channels effectively  our business  revenues and operating results could be harmed 
in particular  we will need to expand our direct sales force and establish relationships with additional system integrators  resellers and other third party partners who market and sell our products 
if we cannot establish these relationships  or if our partners are unable to market our products effectively or provide cost effective customer support and service  our revenues and operating results will be harmed 
even where we are successful in establishing a new third party relationship  our agreement with the third party may not be exclusive and  as a result  our partner may carry competing product lines 
if we are unable to expand our business internationally  our business  revenues and operating results could be harmed 
in order to grow our business  increase our revenues  and improve our operating results  we believe we must continue to expand internationally 
if we expend substantial resources pursuing an international strategy and are not successful  our revenues will be less than our management or market analysts anticipate  and our operating results will suffer 
international revenues represented approximately  and of our business in fiscal  and  respectively 
we have several international sales offices in europe  as well as offices in japan  singapore  australia and elsewhere 
international expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources  and we may not be successful expanding our international operations 
we have limited experience in developing local language versions of our products or in marketing our products to international customers 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell  and deliver our products internationally 
conducting business internationally poses risks that could affect our financial results 
even if we are successful in expanding our operations internationally  conducting business outside north america poses many risks that could adversely affect our operating results 
in particular  we may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  for which hedging activities may not adequately protect us 
moreover  exchange rate risks can have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
where we sell our products in us dollars  our sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the dollar  thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies 
where we sell our products in local currencies  we could be competitively unable to change our prices to reflect fluctuations in the exchange rate 
in recent periods  for example  our revenues in europe have been adversely affected by the decline in the value of the euro and its component currencies relative to the us dollar 
additional risks we face in conducting business internationally include the following longer payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  and the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions that impair trade 
our revenues  operating results  and stock price could be adversely affected if we were unable to conduct our business 
in particular  our administrative facilities and principal business operations are located in california  and any disruption in the available power supply in california could disrupt our operations  reduce our revenues  and increase our expenses 
our operations  and those of third parties on which we rely  are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
a substantial portion of our operating activities and facilities  including our headquarters and principal administrative facilities  are located in the state of california 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could interrupt our power supply or that of our third party service providers and thereby disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  california has implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of one or more of our facilities 
we currently maintain back up generators of power in the event of a blackout 
although our current insurance provides some coverage for any damages we  but not our customers  may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply  it may prove insufficient to cover any damages we might incur 
we are in the process of developing a plan to permit us to continue to operate critical functions based in california during a blackout 
despite these precautions  we may experience an interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts or other forces interrupt our power supply we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  the utility deregulation program instituted in by the california government deregulated wholesale prices while continuing to regulate the retail prices charged by the electrical utilities 
while wholesale prices have increased dramatically  retail prices have  until recently  not increased at comparable rates 
our business is substantially dependent on the availability and price of electricity 
if retail electricity prices rise dramatically  we expect our expenses will increase  our operating results will be harmed  and our stock price could fall 
our outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  and we may incur substantially more debt 
as of the date of this report  we have approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  consisting principally of our convertible subordinated notes due our indebtedness could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  our results of operations will be adversely affected by approximately million in annual interest expenses  payable semi annually 
in addition  our indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
our indebtedness will require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of the cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the terms of our existing indebtedness does not  and future indebtedness may not  prohibit us from doing so 
if new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we may have insufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
we will be required to generate cash sufficient to pay all amounts due on our outstanding indebtedness and to conduct our business operations 
we have incurred net losses  and we may not be able to cover our anticipated debt service obligations 
this may materially hinder our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future operating performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we have made substantial capital commitments that could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition if our business does not grow 
we have made substantial capital commitments as a result of recent growth in our business that could seriously harm our financial condition if our business does not grow and we do not have adequate resources to satisfy our obligations 
in june  we entered into a series of leases covering up to approximately  square feet of office space  including an option on approximately  square feet  for our headquarters in san diego  california 
this office space including the option relates to a five building campus in san diego  california  of which four buildings are presently occupied 
our san diego personnel occupy three of these buildings  and we sublease part of the fourth building 
in june  we exercised our option for the fifth and final building at the san diego campus  which is scheduled to be completed in october including the exercise of the option  the leases require minimum aggregate lease payments of approximately million over their term  which is approximately twelve years 
in atlanta  we lease approximately  square feet of space  principally for our e markets group  under a lease expiring in the capital commitments  construction oversight  and movement of personnel and facilities involved in a transaction of this type and magnitude present numerous risks  including failure to properly estimate the future growth of our business  inability to sublease excess office space if we overestimate future growth  disruption of operations  and inability to match fixed lease payments with fluctuating revenues  which could impair our earnings or result in losses 
product development delays could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenues 
if we experience significant product development delays  our position in the market would be harmed  and our revenues could be substantially reduced  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we have experienced product development delays in the past and may experience delays in the future 
in particular  we may experience product development delays associated with the integration of recently acquired products and technologies 
delays may occur for many reasons  including an inability to hire a sufficient number of developers  discovery of software bugs and errors  or a failure of our current or future products to conform to industry requirements 
errors or other software bugs in our products could result in significant expenditures to correct the errors or bugs and could result in product liability claims 
if we were required to expend significant amounts to correct software bugs or errors  our revenues could be harmed as a result of an inability to deliver the product  and our operating results could be impaired as we incur additional costs without offsetting revenues 
errors can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
we have experienced errors in the past that have resulted in delays in product shipment and increased costs 
discovery of errors could result in any of the following loss of or delay in revenues and loss of customers or market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources and increased development expenses  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  and increased insurance costs 
if we were held liable for damages incurred as a result of our products  our operating results could be significantly impaired 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  these limitations may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of these claims 
we could be competitively disadvantaged if we are unable to protect our intellectual property 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  competitors could offer similar products relying on technologies we developed  potentially harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by limiting access to the distribution of our software  documentation  and other proprietary information and by relying on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws 
in addition  we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain customers  vendors  and strategic partners 
in some circumstances  however  we may  if required by a business relationship  provide our licensees with access to our data model and other proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  and some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  any of which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
if we become involved in an intellectual property dispute  we may incur significant expenses or may be required to cease selling our products  which would substantially impair our revenues and operating results 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights  including rights of companies in the software industry 
we have from time to time in the past received correspondence from third parties alleging that we infringe the third party s intellectual property rights 
we expect these claims to increase as peregrine and its intellectual property portfolio become larger 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may result in our incurring significant expenses and could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtain from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesign those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop non infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  our revenues could decline or our expenses could increase 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
these claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management personnel s attention 
control by our officers and directors may limit our stockholders ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could delay or prevent a change of control  which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium in the market price of their common stock 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock by our officers and directors could delay or prevent a change of control or discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of peregrine 
this could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium in the market price in the event of an acquisition 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may discourage potential acquisition bids for peregrine and may prevent changes in our management that stockholders otherwise would approve 
some provisions of our charter documents eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and impose specific procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at a stockholder meeting 
these provisions are intended to increase the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and the policies established by the board of directors 
these provisions also discourage some types of transactions  which may involve an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce peregrine s vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
as a result  these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction 
these provisions are also intended to discourage common tactics that may be used in proxy fights 
as a result  they could have the effect of discouraging third parties from making tender offers for our shares 
these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored take over attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preference  privileges  and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock allows us to have flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes 
the issuance of preferred stock  however  may delay or prevent a change of control transaction 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and other rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected  including the loss of voting control to others 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile  which may make the common stock difficult to resell at attractive times and prices 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the software industry generally or specifically in the markets for infrastructure management or e business connectivity solutions  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of our competitors and the software industry in general  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  changes in pricing policies  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of our technology in  or compatibility of our technology with  the standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products  our loss of a major customer  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our common stock in the public market  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and in particular the markets for securities of technology and software companies  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility and a significant cumulative decline in recent months 
this volatility has affected many companies irrespective of or disproportionately to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors can materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
additional risks associated with our pending acquisition of remedy corporation on june   we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we would acquire all the outstanding shares of remedy corporation  a supplier of information technology service management and customer relationship management solutions 
if the merger is completed  we will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of remedy 
each outstanding share of remedy common stock will be exchanged for in cash and shares of our common stock 
in addition  we will assume options outstanding under remedy s employee stock incentive plans 
excluding assumed options and based on remedy s outstanding common stock as of june   we expect to issue approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with the merger and to pay remedy stockholders an aggregate of approximately million in cash 
we expect the acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and will be treated as a tax free reorganization 
the definitive agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both remedy and peregrine 
closing of the acquisition is subject to approval by remedy s stockholders  regulatory approvals including united states and foreign antitrust approvals  and customary closing conditions 
in connection with the proposed merger  we expect to file a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
the registration statement will contain a proxy statement to be mailed to remedy s stockholders containing additional information about the proposed merger 
investors and securities holders are urged to read the registration statement and the proxy statement when they are available 
the registration statement and the proxy statement will contain important information about remedy  peregrine  the proposed merger  risks relating to the merger  the persons soliciting proxies relating to the proposed merger  their interests in the proposed merger  and related matters 
we may experience problems integrating the businesses of peregrine and remedy 
any integration problems could cause us to incur substantial unanticipated costs and expenses  which would harm our operating results 
if we fail to successfully integrate our business with remedy s business  we will incur substantial costs  which will increase our expenses and increase our losses 
our target markets have differed historically 
specifically  peregrine s customer base has been comprised principally of large  multinational enterprises  while remedy s sales have historically focused primarily on small to mid size businesses and organizations and to departments or divisions of large organizations 
the characteristics of these two market segments may be sufficiently distinct so that we do not realize the anticipated synergies of the merger 
we have less experience selling to smaller organizations  and our sales practices and processes may not be well suited to success in these markets 
in particular  our sales efforts tend to focus on senior executives  chief financial officers and chief technology officers of large  multinational corporations to whom we seek to sell large  enterprise wide licenses of our infrastructure management products 
in contrast  remedy s transaction sizes tend to be substantially smaller  and their sales efforts  when targeted at larger organizations  have focused historically on managers of departments or divisions within the organization 
in addition  remedy markets and sells other products  such as its customer relationship management products  that we have no experience marketing or selling 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating the companies respective businesses  our combined revenues could fall or grow at a slower rate than anticipated  we could incur substantial unexpected expenses  and we could fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 
any integration problems we experience could divert our management s attention from other business opportunities  which could result in slower revenue growth than anticipated or in declines in revenue 
integrating our business with remedy s business will be complex  time consuming  and expensive 
the merger may disrupt both companies businesses if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
peregrine and remedy are both global companies with substantial operations throughout the world  and integrating geographically separate and dispersed organizations may be difficult 
specific integration challenges faced by peregrine and remedy include the following retaining existing customers and strategic partners  retaining and integrating management and other key employees of both companies  combining product offerings and product lines effectively and quickly  including technical integration by our respective engineering teams  integrating sales efforts so that customers can easily do business with the combined company  transitioning multiple locations around the world to common systems  including common information technology systems  persuading employees that the business cultures of the two companies are compatible  successfully developing and promoting a unified brand strategy and marketing it to existing and prospective customers  and developing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies 
the announcement of the merger could have an adverse effect on one or both companies revenues in near term quarters if customers delay  defer  or cancel purchases pending resolution of the merger 
the announcement of the merger could have an adverse effect on the near term revenues and profitability of either or both of peregrine and remedy 
in particular  prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase either company s products if they are uncertain about the direction of the combined company s product offerings and its willingness to support and service existing products 
since announcement of the merger  we have experienced questions from prospective customers about the status of the merger and our anticipated product integration plans  which have not yet been determined 
we understand that remedy is experiencing similar inquiries 
the merger was announced on june   in the last month of peregrine s first quarter of fiscal and the last month of remedy s second quarter of fiscal both peregrine and remedy tend to realize a substantial portion of their revenues during the last few weeks of a quarter 
accordingly  the announcement of the merger could create uncertainty among businesses and organizations contemplating software or service purchases and subscriptions 
if one large customer  or a significant group of small customers  were to delay their purchase decisions pending resolution of the merger  the quarterly revenues of either peregrine or remedy could be substantially below the expectations of market analysts  which would have an adverse effect on their results of operations and could cause a dramatic reduction in either company s stock price 
we anticipate announcement of the merger could have an adverse effect on either or both companies revenues in the june and other near term quarters pending completion of the merger and our announcements concerning product integration initiatives 
the merger could impair existing relationships of peregrine and remedy with suppliers  customers  strategic partners  and employees  which could have an adverse effect on our individual and combined businesses and financial results 
the public announcement of the merger could substantially impair important business relationships of either peregrine or remedy 
impairment of these business relationships could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses  either of which would harm our financial results 
specific examples of situations in which we could experience problems include the following suppliers  distributors  or customers of either peregrine or remedy could decide to cancel or terminate existing arrangements  or fail to renew those arrangements  as a result of the merger  customers of remedy could terminate or delay orders with remedy because they question remedy s continued commitment to provide products and enhancements  or to support products  key employees of remedy may decide to terminate their employment  and other current or prospective employees of peregrine and remedy may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company  which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing  and technical personnel 
our stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger 
if the combined company is unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger  our stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interest without receiving any commensurate benefit 
in connection with the merger  we anticipate that we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock including options being assumed  representing approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  failure to complete the merger could have a negative impact on our stock price as well as a negative impact on our businesses and financial results 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  we may be subject to a number of material risks  including the following the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the relevant current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed 
our stock price may decline because of uncertainty concerning our stand alone prospects  and some costs related to the merger  such as legal  accounting  financial advisory  and financial printing fees must be paid even if the merger is not completed 
the benefits that we expect to realize from the merger  such as the potentially enhanced financial position of the combined company  would not be realized  and the diversion of management attention from our day to day business and the unavoidable disruption to our employees and our relationships with customers and suppliers during the period before consummation of the merger may make it difficult for us to regain our financial market position if the merger does not occur
