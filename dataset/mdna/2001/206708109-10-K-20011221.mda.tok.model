overview concur technologies  inc is a leading provider of web based corporate expense management software and services that automate costly and inefficient business processes  allowing companies to leverage their most limited resources time  money  knowledge  and energy 
our software products include concur expense tm software for automating travel and entertainment expense management  concur payment tm software for automating employee requests for vendor payments  and concur time tm software for automating time tracking and reporting 
these software products are designed to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes through both license and application service provider asp models 
we offer our products on a license basis primarily to large companies that want a highly configurable solution that is managed in house and delivered over a corporate intranet 
we also offer concur expense as a service on an asp delivery basis primarily to mid size companies that want a configured solution provided on an outsourced basis over the internet 
since  more than companies  including at t  citigroup  daimlerchrysler  dupont  first union  and pfizer  have licensed over million employees to use our market leading software and services to reduce their costs  increase their productivity  improve compliance with their business policies  and expand their knowledge base with respect to their internal business processes 
our strategic relationships include more than world class organizations such as adp  inc  american express  kpmg consulting  inc  microsoft corporation  and microsoft great plains business solutions 
we were incorporated in and commenced operations in fiscal  initially developing quickxpense  a retail  shrink wrapped application that automated travel and entertainment expense reporting for individuals 
we first shipped quickxpense in fiscal and sold it through a combination of retail channels and direct marketing  utilizing a small sales force and no consulting or implementation staff 
over time  businesses began seeking automation of enterprise wide travel and entertainment expense management processes  including back office processing and integration to financial systems 
in july  in response to this demand  we significantly expanded our product development efforts and released concur expense  a client server based corporate expense management software product 
in march  we released a web based version of concur expense  which takes advantage of the internet and corporate intranets to reach all employees in an enterprise 
our web based version of concur expense has accounted for a majority of concur expense license revenues since its release 
on june   we acquired software  inc  a privately held software company and the developer of concur procurement 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
software was incorporated in may software was selling the initial version of its product through a single sales representative at the time of the acquisition 
after our acquisition we continued to sell concur procurement until we announced on june  that we had discontinued offering it for sale as part of our new operating plan 
on june   we acquired seeker software  inc  a privately held software company and developer of concur human resources 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of seeker software 
the historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their actual operating cost structures 
upon our acquisition of seeker software  it was our intention to integrate concur human resources with concur expense and concur procurement as a suite of solutions through a common user interface known as concur eworkplace 
on june   after carefully studying the cost of this integration effort and its related benefits  we announced that we would not integrate these products into a single product suite  but rather keep concur human resources as a separate product offering 
in october  we began offering concur expense on an asp delivery basis  principally to mid size companies 
in december  we introduced an additional asp offering for large companies that want a configured solution offered on an outsourced basis 
our asp solutions require limited it infrastructure and limited it support on the part of the customer 
on june   we announced a new operating plan  under which we discontinued concur procurement  discontinued our planned integration of concur human resources with our other products  and announced a workforce reduction of employees to bring our cost structure in line with our new operating plan 
the primary objective of this operating plan was to focus on providing corporate expense management software and services and generating positive cash flow and profitable growth 
on march   we sold our concur human resources product line to mbh solutions  inc the transaction consisted of the sale of certain assets to  and assumption of certain obligations by  mbh solutions  inc in exchange for cash consideration to be paid in installments over time 
the transaction resulted in a workforce reduction of employees  the majority of whom continued employment with mbh solutions  inc our primary objective in this sale was to further our focus on the corporate expense management market 
results of operations revenues years ended september  dollars in thousands change change license    asp  services    gross revenues    sales returns allowances  net revenues    we market our software and services through our direct sales organization in the united states and the united kingdom  and through strategic referral and reseller arrangements in the united states and in international markets 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside the united states were million  million  and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
historically  as a result of the relatively small amount of our international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
we had no customer that accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal   or license revenues 
license revenues consist of software license fees 
the decrease in license revenues in fiscal from fiscal reflects the discontinuation of concur procurement products and the sale of the concur human resources product line 
we recorded the sales returns and allowances reserve in fiscal because of the discontinuation of concur procurement  and to cover any product returns resulting from that decision 
a small portion of that reserve was reversed as a result of a change in estimate during the quarter ended march the decrease in license revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was the result of the discontinuation of the concur procurement products  as well as an emphasis earlier in fiscal on the marketing and selling of products other than concur expense  which caused sales of concur expense to decline 
asp revenues 
asp revenues consist of monthly usage fees as well as the amortization of setup and consulting fees 
setup fees are collected at the time of sale but revenue recognition is deferred and amortized over the expected life of the relationship 
we have experienced a significant increase in demand for our asp solutions since launching these product offerings during the first quarter of fiscal  which was driven in part by the introduction of sales through our strategic relationships 
in may  we entered into a strategic relationship with adp  inc  under which adp markets our asp solutions directly and indirectly to its existing customers and to potential new customers 
sales through this channel commenced in the september quarter of fiscal in addition  we signed a reseller agreement with microsoft great plains business solutions in june under which microsoft great plains business solutions agreed to resell and jointly market our asp solutions to their existing customers and to potential new customers through its value added reseller network 
the first sales of product through this channel occurred late in the september quarter of fiscal the majority of new asp sales during the second half of fiscal occurred through our indirect channels  nearly all of which were through adp 
we expect asp revenues to continue to grow during fiscal as a result of the continued development and expansion of our strategic relationships  and to a lesser extent  as we increase our direct sales focus on companies with  to  employees 
services revenues 
services revenues consist of customer support fees  consulting services fees  and training fees 
customer support fees are typically billed annually and amortized over the period of the contract 
the moderate increase in services revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  is primarily related to an increase in annual customer support contracts entered into in the current and prior periods  which is a direct result of a growing installed customer base  offset only in part by a reduction in such contracts as a result of the discontinuation of concur procurement and the sale of the concur human resources product line 
the increase in services revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily achieved through increased consulting services revenue associated with sales  upgrades  and enhancements of concur expense  and to a lesser degree  license sales of concur human resources and related consulting services 
we expect consulting services revenues to fluctuate based on new sales of our products and the related services provided  as well as the demand for upgrades and enhancements to concur expense 
revenue recognition 
revenue resulting from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer  however  if collectability is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenues resulting from asp services  which consist primarily of initiation and usage fees  are recognized over the lives of the related agreements  which are typically two years  and as services are provided to end users 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
in some cases  revenues generated as an application service provider are derived from arrangements with partners and affiliates 
these revenues are recorded on a gross basis with related commissions recorded as a selling expense when we assume the related business risks such as performance and credit risk 
such business risks are evidenced by  among other things  instances in which we are the primary obligor in the arrangement or when we establish the pricing of the arrangement 
otherwise  these revenues are recorded on a net basis 
services revenues earned from customers that license our software result from systems integration or other consulting services  customer support agreements  and training 
when software licenses and services are sold together  the services are evaluated to determine whether they are essential to the functionality of the software 
when services are considered essential  revenue under the arrangement is recognized using contract accounting 
when services are not considered essential  the revenue related to the services is recognized as the services are performed 
customer support agreements provide for technical support and include the right to receive upgrades 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized over the life of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
cost of revenues years ended september  dollars in thousands change change cost of license revenues   percentage of gross license revenues cost of asp revenues   percentage of asp revenues cost of services revenues    percentage of services revenues total cost of revenues    percentage of gross revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists mainly of royalties for sub licensing third party software  and  to a lesser extent  the costs of manuals  media  and duplication for our licensed products 
the decrease in cost of license revenues for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was due in part to the amortization of purchased technology which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  the decrease was due to a decline in the volume of manuals  media  and duplication expenditures  as well as a decrease in royalties paid to third parties for sub licensed software 
the slight increase in cost of license revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to an increase in royalties paid for sub licensing third party software 
we expect that the cost of license revenues will continue to fluctuate modestly in relation to changes in the overall demand for our license products as well as the cost for sub licensing third party software 
cost of asp revenues 
cost of asp revenues consists mainly of salaries  server costs and storage fees  telecommunication charges  strategic referral and reseller fees  and amortization of deferred set up costs 
the cost of asp revenues for fiscal increased significantly from fiscal  primarily due to our investment in infrastructure to accommodate the current and near term growth of our asp business and  to a lesser extent  the payment of reseller fees associated with the increase in asp sales generated through our strategic partners 
we expect the cost of asp revenues to grow during fiscal primarily due to the payment of reseller fees relating to our expected growth in asp sales through strategic partners 
however  we expect the growth in asp revenues to exceed the growth in cost of asp revenues during fiscal  resulting in a positive asp gross margin by the end of the third quarter of fiscal cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues includes primarily the salaries  non reimbursable expenses  and other operating costs of employees who provide customer support  consulting services  and product training 
the decrease in cost of services revenues for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to continued improvements in our solutions which lead to an overall reduction in our costs to deliver such services  as well as a decrease in professional services personnel relating to our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement  the sale of our concur human resources product line  and our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
the increase in cost of services revenues in fiscal from fiscal primarily was due to increases in professional service personnel to manage and support our growing customer base  across a suite of products 
cost of services revenues as a percentage of services revenues may vary between periods due to changes in the level and mix of services provided

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  travel  and facility costs for our sales and marketing personnel and  to a lesser extent  costs of advertising  trade shows  and other promotional activities 
the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to lower payroll  advertising expenses  commissions  and travel costs 
these decreases reflect our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement  the sale of our concur human resources product line  and our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
the increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses attributable to an increase in the number of personnel in the sales and marketing area  and to a lesser extent  an increase in advertising and other promotional activities in the first half of fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and contract labor for software development  facility costs  and expenses associated with computer software and hardware used in our software development activities 
the decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflects lower utilization of outside contractors and staffing reductions  primarily due our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement  the sale of our concur human resources product line  and our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was related to increased hiring of employees and outside contractors as software engineers  program managers  and quality assurance personnel to support our expanded product lines and ongoing product development  and to a lesser extent  higher salaries paid to employees due to increasing market rates during that time 
in fiscal  we expect to increase headcount and related resources in our software engineering organization as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement to enable us to extend our leadership position in corporate expense management software and services 
we expect total research and development expenditures to decrease moderately as we continue our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
in the development of our new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant  and all costs related to internal research and development have been expensed as incurred 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs associated with finance  accounting  investor relations  human resources  administration and facilities activities 
the decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower utilization of contract labor and to a lower provision for bad debts  and  to a lesser degree  reflects lower facility costs and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
these decreases reflect our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement  the sale of our concur human resources product line  and our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
the increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulted from a combination of factors  including the hiring of additional general and administrative personnel to support the growth of our business  the increased use of outside contractors associated with increased recruiting efforts  the higher amortization of deferred stock compensation  and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to our increase in revenues 
merger  acquisition and restructuring charges 
restructuring charges for fiscal consist of restructuring costs of  in connection with the sale of our concur human resources product line  less i a  net gain on the sale of these assets  and ii a  reduction in the amount accrued for our restructuring in june as a result of changes in the estimated amounts required for severance and related benefits  facilities  and product marketing commitments 
restructuring charges for fiscal include a charge of million for our restructuring in june  which included amounts for severance and related benefits  facilities  and product marketing commitments 
merger and acquisition costs for fiscal were comprised of a reduction in the amount accrued as a result of a revision in estimated costs of million relating to the acquisition of seeker software in june merger costs for fiscal include all costs related to the acquisition of seeker software in june interest income and interest expense years ended september  dollars in thousands change change interest income    interest expense   interest income and interest expense 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities upon which we earn interest  and to a lesser extent  to lower interest rates earned on our investment portfolio 
the increase in interest income in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to interest income earned on the higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of proceeds received in december and april from our public offerings as well as our private placement in february the decrease in interest expense in both fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to lower outstanding interest bearing obligations related to bank borrowings and capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses since inception that have resulted in deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance

our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  was million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was principally a result of collected balances on large  outstanding invoices  and a more current aging 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable was days and days as of september  and  respectively 
this improvement was primarily the result of improved collections on outstanding accounts receivable as well as the increase in significance of monthly asp billings which are  for the most part  collected in advance of each monthly period 
we expect that dso will fluctuate in future quarters  based on current period revenues  the accounts receivable aging  as well as the revenue mix between license and asp sales 
our total current liabilities were million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease consisted primarily of a decrease in the current portion of debt and lease liabilities  as we pay off such liabilities 
this decrease was also the result of a reduction of the sales return reserve and restructuring reserve  both of which were accrued at the time of our june restructuring event 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser degree  through the use of long term debt  notes payable to stockholders  and equipment leases 
our sources of liquidity as of september  consisted principally of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  all totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for such periods  net cash used by operating activities was primarily a result of funding operations 
our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment  and purchase and related maturity of marketable securities 
property and equipment acquisitions  including those acquired under capital leases  totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  representing a decrease of million  or in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of million or in from the decrease in fiscal was the result of more equipment purchases related to start up of our asp business  a growing employee base for which property and equipment was purchased  and the purchase and implementation of several software programs during fiscal the increase in property and equipment acquisitions in fiscal resulted from a sharp increase in personnel during the first half of that year 
our financing activities used million in fiscal and provided million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the net usage of cash in financing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of payments made on existing loans and capital leases  offset in part by the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock 
in december  we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with our ipo  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million  net of offering costs 
in connection with our ipo  we also received proceeds totaling million from the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in april  we completed a follow on offering of our common stock and issued an additional  shares  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other offering costs 
in february  we completed a private placement of our common stock and received approximately million in cash  net of commissions and other offering costs 
in july  we entered into a subordinated loan and security agreement with an equipment lessor in the principal amount of million that bears interest at an annual rate of 
in may  this agreement was amended to allow for additional borrowings of million bearing interest at an annual rate of on the first million and on the remaining million 
the notes are due in varying monthly installments through april  and contain certain restrictions and covenants  with which we are currently in compliance 
at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the subordinated loan agreement was  in september  we entered into an additional subordinated promissory note agreement with an equipment lessor in the principal amount of million 
the note bears interest at  payments are due in monthly installments of approximately  including interest  and the note matures in november at september   the outstanding indebtedness under the subordinated loan agreement was  presently  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in the future  we may pursue additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  financing under leasing arrangements  or other available means 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
business outlook the following statements are based on our current expectations and we do not undertake any duty to update them 
these statements are forward looking and inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ materially as a result of the factors described under factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in this report  as well as in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
looking forward  we currently have the following expectations for fiscal 
we expect revenues to grow to in fiscal over fiscal and we have moderated our operating expenses accordingly  
we expect that the business for our asp solutions in both the large and middle markets will become a more significant portion of our overall business by the end of fiscal  
we expect that the business for our asp solutions will reflect positive gross margin by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 
we expect to achieve profitability by the end of fiscal and to become cash flow positive before the end of fiscal  
we expect total net revenues to be between and million for fiscal  
we expect total cost of revenues to be between and million for fiscal  
we expect total operating expenses to be between and million for fiscal  and 
we expect a loss per share of between and for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operating results are not materially sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on our marketable securities portfolio and interest rates at september   a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately  respectively  in the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio  however  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold
