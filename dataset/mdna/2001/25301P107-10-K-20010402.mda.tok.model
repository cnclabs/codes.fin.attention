also  an increase of approximately million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is attributed to the effect of acquisitions 
cost of revenues grew at a slower rate than revenues primarily as a result of the ability to leverage the cost structure of the paid job listing business

amortization will decrease in due to the sale of the content business and the write off of related intangible assets 
however  we expect this decrease to be partially offset by additional amortization due to future payments on earnout obligations for the dice 
com and measureup acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from the issuance of the convertible notes in the first quarter of  which accounted for million of the total increase  partially offset by a decrease of million in interest expense due to the conversion of the microhouse convertible notes into earthweb common stock

given earthweb s limited operating history and losses incurred to date  we do not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax assets meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded

financial position  liquidity and capital resources earthweb historically has satisfied its cash requirements primarily through offerings of common stock and convertible notes and lease financings 
subsequent to the disposition of the content business  we believe that the company s current cash position and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will achieve its planned results 
if anticipated results are not achieved  management has the ability to delay or reduce its expenditures so as to not require additional financing  if such financing is not available on terms acceptable to the company 
earthweb will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in  business products and technologies that are complementary to those of the company  which may require the use of cash

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term investment portfolio and outstanding debt 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company mainly invests its excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate money market instruments 
if market rates increase  the company runs the risk that the related income from those holdings will be less than those that could be obtained from newer issues of similar securities 
additionally  the fair market value of these securities will decline in value 
at december  the company s outstanding debt approximated million  all of which constitute fixed rate obligations 
if market rates decline  the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those that would be paid based on the current market rate 
equity price risk the company has minimal investments in various equity securities 
these investments  as of december   were considered available for sale  with the unrealized gains deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
the company seeks preservation of capital and selectively considers investments in equity securities as part of its investment strategy
