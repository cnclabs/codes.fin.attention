item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we have materially expanded our business through acquisitions 
the acquisitions of the licenses  operations  and related assets of triton cellular partners  lp triton cellular and atlantic cellular company lp atlantic cellular  in fiscal and  respectively  approximately doubled our number of customers at the time of each transaction  on a pro forma basis 
all acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  therefore  our historical results of operations include the results of operations for each acquired system subsequent to its respective acquisition date 
over the past three years  our financial performance  and the year to year comparability of such performance  has been affected by the acquisitions described below  the development of wireless alliance  the issuance of our senior subordinated notes and junior and senior exchangeable preferred stock  the issuance of common stock in february  and the billion credit facility 
acquisition and joint venture history we follow a strategy of acquiring and developing wireless systems  primarily in rural markets 
through december   we have entered into a joint venture to develop and offer personal communications services and have completed the acquisitions of cellular systems as described below in november  we formed a joint venture named wireless alliance with an affiliate of voicestream communications 
we originally owned of wireless alliance  as of june  we increased our ownership to  with an affiliate of voicestream communications owning the remaining 
effective may  we acquired the maine wireless operations and assets of unity cellular systems  inc and related cellular and microwave licenses from intercel  inc for approximately million 
effective july  we acquired the massachusetts  new hampshire  new york  vermont and cellular licenses  operations  and related assets of atlantic cellular lp and one of its subsidiaries for approximately million 
effective august  we acquired the outstanding stock of western maine cellular  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of utilities  inc  for approximately million 
effective february  we acquired the outstanding stock of rgi group  inc  d b a glacial lakes cellular  for approximately million 
effective april  we acquired the licenses  operations and related assets of triton cellular  covering portions of alabama  kansas  mississippi  oregon  and washington for approximately billion 
on january   we completed the million acquisition of the cellular licenses  operations  and related assets of saco river telegraph and telephone company saco river 
saco river provides wireless services under the name starcellular in the portsmouth  new hampshire cellular service area  which includes  pops population served covering approximately  square miles 
saco river s independent local exchange carrier ilec operations cover a square mile area in the northern portion of york county  maine  providing approximately  customers local and long distance phone service in addition to internet service for  customers 
general rural cellular s principal operating objective is to increase revenues and profitability through the acquisition and development of new markets and increased penetration in existing markets 
we believe that owning and operating wireless systems in rural markets provides growth opportunities because these systems have lower penetration rates  a higher proportion of roaming revenues  and less competition for customers than wireless systems located in larger metropolitan areas 
we have a strategy of acquiring wireless systems primarily in rural markets and focus on acquiring underdeveloped wireless systems that include a high concentration of highway corridors and  as a result  tend to have a significant amount of roaming activity 
we have continued to penetrate our existing regions through our sales initiatives  resulting in increased revenues in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
our revenues primarily consist of service  roaming and equipment revenues  each of which is described below service revenues include monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of the time included in the service package purchased  long distance charges derived from calls placed by our customers as well as cellular and paging equipment lease revenues 
total service revenues are affected by the number of customers  pricing  and number of minutes used 
additional charges include activation fees and charges for such features as voicemail  call waiting  and call forwarding 
rcc also includes the charges to our customers when they use their cellular phone in other wireless providers markets incollect revenue as service revenue 
roaming revenues include only the revenue from other wireless providers customers who use rcc s network outcollect revenue equipment revenues include sales of cellular and paging equipment  accessory sales to customers  and network equipment reselling 
our operating expenses include network costs  cost of equipment sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization  each of which is described below network costs include switching and transport expenses and the expenses associated with the maintenance and operation of our wireless network facilities  as well as charges from other service providers for resold minutes and the expense associated with incollect revenue 
cost of equipment sales includes the costs associated with telephone equipment and accessories sold to customers 
in recent years  rcc and other cellular providers have increased the use of discounts on phone equipment as competition between service providers has intensified 
as a result  rcc has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  losses on equipment sales and increased marketing and selling costs per gross additional customer 
rcc expects to continue these discounts and promotions because it believes they will result in increases in the number of cellular customers and  consequently  increased revenues 
selling  general and administrative includes salaries  benefits  and operating expenses such as marketing  commissions  customer support  accounting  administration  and billing 
depreciation and amortization represents the costs associated with the depreciation of rcc s fixed assets and the amortization of its intangible assets  primarily cellular license acquisition costs  goodwill and customer lists 
the high level of depreciation and amortization is associated with rcc s acquisition activities and the build out and upgrade of its network 
in addition to the operating expenses discussed above  rcc also incurs other income expense  primarily interest expense related to financing and acquisition activities 
interest expense primarily results from borrowings under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  the proceeds of which were used to finance acquisitions and further develop rcc s cellular network 
other income expense includes rcc s minority partner s absorption of wireless alliance losses as accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles 
rcc realized the maximum benefit from the allocation of losses to the minority partner as of december  and will receive no further benefit until wireless alliance generates income 
results of operations the following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues as well as other operating data for the periods indicated 
years ended december  revenues service roaming equipment total revenues operating expenses network costs cost of equipment sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense interest and dividend income minority interest other other expense  net income loss before income tax and extraordinary item income tax provision net income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item early extinguishment of debt net income loss preferred stock dividend net loss applicable to common shares ebitda ebitda is the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and is utilized as a performance measure within the cellular industry 
ebitda is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative for other performance measures and should not be considered in isolation 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and does not reflect all expenses of doing business eg  interest expense  depreciation 
accordingly  ebitda should not be considered as having greater significance than or as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
years ended december  and revenues service revenues 
service revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the revenue growth reflects the additional revenue resulting from triton cellular combined with additional net prepaid and postpaid customers added through increased penetration in existing markets 
we expect service revenues to increase in the future primarily as a result of anticipated growth in customers and expansion of coverage 
roaming revenues 
reflecting the acquisition of triton cellular in april combined with increases in outcollect roaming minutes  consolidated roaming revenues for increased to million from million in roaming minutes in existing markets have increased in part due to the activation of additional cell sites and increased industry wide wireless usage resulting from the now popular single rate calling plans 
partially offsetting the increase in roaming minutes of use during was the decrease in roaming yield per minute  including toll  to as compared to in we expect roaming revenues to increase in primarily reflecting roaming revenue from the newly acquired saco river service areas 
equipment revenues 
equipment revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the prior year 
this growth reflects rcc ownership in triton cellular for nine months as well as increases in direct phone sales programs

in future periods  we anticipate reducing network costs  as a percentage of revenues 
cost of equipment sales 
reflecting additional equipment costs resulting from the acquisition of triton cellular  cost of equipment sales for increased over to million 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of equipment sales increased to as compared to in contributing to the increase in cost of equipment sales  as a percentage of revenue  were handset costs resulting from the migration of existing customers from analog service to digital service and greater emphasis on the purchase of digital phones rather than renting them 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased over to million 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily reflects rcc s ownership of triton cellular operations for the second  third and fourth quarters of the increase also reflects higher costs related to more aggressive promotional activity during as compared to reflecting efficiencies resulting from the acquisition of triton cellular  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales for  decreased to as compared to in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased over the prior year to million from million 
the increase reflects added amortization relating to the intangible assets acquired from triton cellular  additional depreciation attributable to triton s property  plant and equipment in addition to the depreciation related to million of capital expenditures during other income expense interest expense 
interest expense for increased to million as compared to million in the increase primarily reflects increased borrowing under the credit facility to complete the acquisition of triton cellular 
interest and dividend income 
interest and dividend income for increased to million  as compared to  during this increase primarily reflects interest earned by our interest bearing restricted escrow accounts and other cash balances funded through increased borrowings and proceeds from the sale of common and preferred stock 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends in increased to million as compared to million in the increase primarily resulted from the issuances of junior and senior exchangeable preferred stock in february  class t preferred stock issued in march and class m preferred stock issued in april dividends on the senior and junior preferred stock were and will be paid through the issuance of additional shares of exchangeable preferred stock 
throughout  rcc issued  and  shares of senior and junior preferred stock dividends respectively

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased over the prior year to million from million 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects rcc s ownership of the atlantic cellular for a full year during as compared to six months in reflecting certain economies achieved through the acquisition of atlantic cellular and the relatively fixed nature of selling  general and administrative expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december  to as compared to in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased over the prior year to million from million

other income 
other income for the year ended december  includes a decrease of in the minority partner s absorption of wireless alliance losses  to million from million in the prior year 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase primarily resulted from the senior exchangeable preferred stock having been outstanding for a full year in  versus less than eight months in the preferred stock dividends were paid by issuing additional shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources rcc s primary liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  and acquisitions 
in the past rcc has met these requirements through cash flow from operations  sales of common stock and preferred securities  borrowings under its credit facility  and issuance of its senior subordinated notes 
on april   rcc amended and restated its credit facility increasing it from million to billion in addition to creating a million incremental facility 
the credit facility was amended and restated again on june  to increase the incremental facility from million to million 
reflecting the acquisition of triton cellular and other operating cash requirements  rcc had billion outstanding under its credit facility as of december  the credit facility was also amended and restated in december in connection with the acquisition of saco river and to amend certain covenants 
after completing the acquisition of saco river  as of january   we had drawn approximately billion with additional availability under our credit facility of approximately million 
under the credit facility  amounts may be borrowed  subject to mandatory repayments  or repaid at any time through maturity  provided that the outstanding borrowings do not exceed the total amount available 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  adjustments to the million net loss to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities included million in depreciation and amortization  a million increase in accounts receivable  million increase in accounts payable and million increase in other accrued expenses

on april   rcc issued  shares of redeemable voting convertible preferred stock for consideration of million 
the redeemable voting convertible preferred stock may be converted into common stock at per share 
other matters inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income 
our average monthly roaming revenue per cellular customer increases during the second and third calendar quarters 
this increase reflects greater usage by our roaming customers who travel in our cellular service area for weekend and vacation recreation or work in seasonal industries 
because our cellular service area includes many seasonal recreational areas  we expect that roaming revenues will continue to fluctuate seasonally more than service revenues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk rural cellular corporation has used senior subordinated notes and bank credit facilities as part of its financing of acquisition activities  capital requirements and operations 
these on balance sheet financial instruments  to the extent they provide for variable rates of interest  expose rcc to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate risk exposure resulting from changes in libor or the prime rate  which are used to determine the interest rates that are applicable to borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
rcc uses off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap and interest rate protection agreements  to manage interest rate risk 
at december   rcc had debt totaling billion under our credit facility 
rcc has interest rate swap  collar and flooridor arrangements covering debt with a notional amount of million to effectively change the interest on the underlying debt from a variable rate to a fixed rate for the term of the agreements 
after giving effect to these instruments rcc had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
had rcc not entered into the interest rate swaps  collars and flooridor  and holding other variables constant  such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates  net of the effect of derivatives  would have impacted pretax earnings and cash flows for the year ended december  by approximately million
