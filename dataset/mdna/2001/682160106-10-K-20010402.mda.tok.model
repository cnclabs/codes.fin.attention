provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  represents tax on income in certain international and domestic jurisdictions 
net loss net loss increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of cash during were net cash from operations of million and net borrowings of million from the company s revolving credit facility 
cash was expended primarily for capital expenditures  which totaled million during  primarily for the conversion of spectravision systems  the installation of new hotels with the ocx and ocv systems  the conversion of ocv systems to ocx  increased inventory  and internal fixed asset purchases  as well as interest expenses 
at december   the company s installed room base was approximately  as compared to approximately  at the end of during  the company installed its ocx and ocv systems in approximately  rooms  of which approximately  were new hotel installations  approximately  were conversions of spectravision properties  and  were conversions of ocv systems to ocx 
the company s principal cash requirements in are expected to include the installation of the company s ocx system in new hotels  the continued conversion of spectravision properties to the more flexible ocx system  conversions of ocv rooms to ocx  and internal fixed asset purchases 
the company anticipates these activities will require capital expenditures of approximately to million in  as well as funding for the operational requirements of the company  including additional relocation costs estimated at to million 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
the company s ability to draw additional funds under the revolving credit facility is limited by the total amount of borrowing permitted by the revolving credit facility and certain financial covenants contained in that facility 
in particular  prior to the amendment described below  a covenant contained in the revolving credit facility limited the total amount of indebtedness of the company to times the company s ebitda plus certain non recurring expenses million in for the trailing four quarters 
on march   the company entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility that a reduces the total amount of borrowing allowed from million to million and b amends the financial covenant described in the previous sentence to allow for total indebtedness of the company up to times the company s ebitda plus certain non recurring expenses million in for the trailing four quarters 
subject to the following paragraph  the company could obtain an additional million in long term financing under the revolving credit facility  as amended 
in addition to the limitations on borrowing contained in the revolving credit agreement  certain covenants in the public indebtedness of ascent effectively prevent the company s total indebtedness from exceeding an aggregate of million so long as such public indebtedness of ascent is outstanding 
at march   the total indebtedness of the company was equal to million and therefore no funds are or will be available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility  as amended  or under any other debt arrangements while the public indebtedness of ascent remains outstanding 
without additional sources of capital  the company will not be able to satisfy its future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements from existing cash  cash generated from operations and funds available under existing borrowing arrangements 
it will be necessary for the company to raise additional capital through additional debt or equity financing in order to satisfy these requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on terms acceptable to the company or  if available  that the proceeds of such financing would be sufficient to enable the company to satisfy all of its requirements 
in addition  while ascent s public indebtedness referred to in the previous paragraph is outstanding  the company will not be able to raise additional debt financing 
if the company is unable to raise additional financing  the company would need to reduce its capital spending well below the levels stated above for the year see business risks dependence on additional capital for growth 
foreign exchange the company believes the risks of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its present operations are not material to the company s overall financial condition 
however  should the company s international operations grow  occ will consider using foreign currency contracts  swap arrangements  or other financial instruments designed to limit exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
business risks control by liberty media corporation as of december   liberty beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding occ common stock through its wholly owned subsidiary ascent 
accordingly  liberty currently has the voting power to control all matters requiring approval of occ s stockholders 
for example  liberty can elect a majority of occ s board of directors  approve most matters submitted to a vote of occ s stockholders and reject any matter submitted to a vote of occ s stockholders 
this concentration of ownership would prevent a third party from effecting a change of control of occ  absent liberty s approval 
in addition  liberty is not subject to any standstill or similar obligations with respect to occ that would prevent it from acquiring additional shares of occ common stock  causing occ to merge with another entity or taking similar corporate action with respect to occ 
liberty s interests may not be the same as that of the other occ stockholders 
dependence on additional capital occ s ability to meet its obligations and grow its business requires substantial investment on a continuing basis to finance current obligations  planned capital expenditures and related expenses 
the company intends to use cash flow from operations and additional debt or equity financing to support its current obligations and its growth 
whether or when occ can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support its anticipated growth cannot be accurately predicted 
unless such cash flow levels are achieved  occ will require additional borrowings or the sale of debt or equity securities  or some combination thereof  to provide funding for its obligations and its growth or  alternatively  may have to reduce its operations and growth to a level that can be supported by internally generated cash flow 
occ can give no assurances with respect to the impact on the results of operations and financial condition if occ is required to reduce growth to a level that can be supported by internally generated cash flow 
occ s ability to raise additional debt financing is limited by the provisions of its existing revolving credit facility as well as certain provisions contained in the public indebtedness of ascent 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
highly competitive in room entertainment industry the hotel in room entertainment industry is highly competitive 
due to the high level of penetration in the united states lodging industry already achieved by participants in the in room entertainment industry and the current rate of construction and expansion of hotel properties in the united states  most of the growth opportunities in the in room entertainment industry currently involve securing contracts to serve hotels that are already being served by a competing vendor  expanding internationally and broadening the range of services provided 
these circumstances have led to increasing competition for contract renewals  particularly at hotels operated by major hotel chains 
there can be no assurance that occ will obtain new contracts with hotels currently served by other vendors or that occ will be able to retain contracts with the hotels served by the company when those contracts expire 
the loss by occ of one or more of the major hotel chain customers  such as marriott  starwood or hyatt  could have a material adverse impact on occ s results of operations 
see dependence on significant customers 
in addition  there are a number of potential competitors that could utilize their existing infrastructure to provide in room entertainment to the lodging industry  including cable companies including wireless cable  telecommunications companies  and direct to home and direct broadcast satellite companies 
some of these potential competitors already are providing guest programming services to hotels and testing on demand video 
some of these potential competitors have substantially greater resources than occ 
dependence on significant customers marriott  hilton  holiday inn  hyatt and starwood accounted for approximately     and  respectively  of on command s room revenues for the year ended december  these revenue percentages represent all chain affiliations including owned  managed  and franchised hotels 
contracts are written at the hotel level and therefore expirations occur over extended periods of time depending on the installation date of the particular hotel 
the loss of any of these customers  or the loss of a significant number of other hotel chain customers  could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition 
however  these customers represent both chain owned managed hotels  as well as franchisees 
the company often has different contracts on different terms with the chain owned managed hotels  on the one hand  and with the franchisees or groups of franchisees  on the other 
in october  hilton corporation announced that it would not be renewing its master agreement with the company 
the loss of the hilton master agreement resulted in the loss of  hotel rooms owned and  hotel rooms managed and operated by hilton 
these rooms expire in accordance with the individual hotel contracts over the next eight years 
see note and note to consolidated financial statements 
dependence on performance of lodging industry on command s business is closely linked to the performance of the hotel industry in which overall occupancy rates may vary as a result of many factors 
declines in hotel occupancy as a result of general business  economic  seasonal and other factors can have a significant adverse impact on on command results of operations 
in addition  on command markets primarily to the deluxe  luxury and upscale hotel categories 
any acute or prolonged downturn in general business or economic factors could have an adverse effect on the hotel categories comprising on command s market that is more significant than the effect on the lodging industry taken as a whole 
risk of technological obsolescence technology in the entertainment and communications industry is continuously changing as new technologies and developments continue to be introduced 
there can be no assurance that future technological advances will not result in improved equipment or software systems that could adversely affect occ s competitive position 
in order to remain competitive  occ must maintain the programming enhancements  engineering and technical capability and flexibility to respond to customer demands for new or improved versions of its systems and new technological developments  and there can be no assurance that occ will have the financial or technological resources to be successful in doing so 
anti takeover protections liberty indirectly owned approximately of the outstanding occ common stock at december  through its wholly owned subsidiary ascent 
assuming the exercise of all outstanding warrants to purchase occ common stock as well as the conversion of all shares of series a preferred stock  liberty owned approximately of the occ common stock at december  accordingly  occ may not complete any merger or similar transaction without liberty s approval 
in addition  liberty s ownership of occ s common stock enables it to elect a majority of occ s board of directors and otherwise influence occ s management 
see control by liberty media corporation 
even if liberty s interest in occ were reduced below  occ s certificate of incorporation contains certain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  control of occ 
certain of such provisions allow on command corporation to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the occ common stock and impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of occ common stock 
programming the cost to occ to license feature movies from major movie studios is subject to change as the major movie studios continue to negotiate for higher royalty rates as well as higher minimum payments by the company 
such changes may have adverse impacts on the company s earnings 
while the company intends to address such trends  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will prove effective
