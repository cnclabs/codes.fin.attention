item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto referred to in item financial statements and supplemental data  and items and business and properties disclosures regarding forward looking statements of this form k 
overview we are a development stage independent oil and gas exploration company whose strategic focus is the application of advanced seismic imaging and computer aided exploration technologies in the systematic search for commercial hydrocarbon reserves  primarily in the onshore western united states 
we attempt to leverage our technical experience and expertise with seismic data to identify exploration and exploitation projects with significant potential economic return 
we intend to participate in selected exploration projects as a working interest owner  currently as a non operator  sharing both risk and rewards with our partners 
our financial results depend on our ability to sell prospect interests to outside industry participants 
we will not be able to commence exploratory drilling operations without outside industry participation 
we have pursued  and will continue to pursue  exploration opportunities in regions where we believe significant opportunity for discovery of oil and gas exists 
by attempting to reduce drilling risk through seismic technology  we seek to improve the expected return on investment in our oil and gas exploration projects 
our future financial results continue to depend primarily on our ability to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons  the market price for oil and gas  our ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  and our ability to fully implement our exploration and development program with respect to these and other matters 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects or that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production 
liquidity and capital resources at august   we had approximately  in working capital 
during the fiscal year ended august   our capitalized costs for undeveloped oil and gas properties decreased by approximately  the decrease is the result of an impairment taken against our oil and gas properties in the amount of  offset by approximately  of costs incurred for drilling and completion  the cost of acquiring an additional working interest in our east lost hills project  transportation pipeline costs  production facilities costs  delay rentals  and other related direct costs with respect to our exploration and development projects 
during the fiscal year ended august   our capitalized costs for undeveloped oil and gas properties increased by approximately  this net increase is comprised of total costs of approximately  for drilling costs  costs associated with acquiring and retaining exploration acreage  seismic costs associated with undeveloped oil and gas projects  and reclassification of costs paid during the fiscal year ended august  for claims relating to the blowout  offset by a property impairment of  recorded against our cal canal project 
during the fiscal year ended august   our capitalized costs for undeveloped oil and gas properties increased by a net amount of approximately  this net increase is comprised of expenditures on undeveloped oil and gas prospects of approximately  offset by property abandonments and impairments of approximately  during the quarter ended november   the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock converted all of the remaining outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 
per share 
this resulted in a cashless transaction whereby  shares of series a convertible preferred stock were converted into a total of  shares of common stock 
at november   there were no remaining shares of series a convertible preferred stock outstanding 
in november  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock issued in connection with the private placement of the series a convertible preferred stock were exercised at the exercise price of per share

the common stock was sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement and prospectus supplement 
after costs and expenses  we received a net of  investors consisted of a total of ten separate funds managed by four california based institutions 
we had no outstanding long term debt at august  or at august  we have not entered into any commodity swap arrangements or hedging transactions 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may enter into commodity swap and hedging transactions in the future in conjunction with oil and gas production 
it is anticipated that the future development of our business will require additional  and possibly substantial  capital expenditures 
our capital expenditure budget for the fiscal year ending august  will depend on our success in selling additional prospects for cash  the level of industry participation in our exploration projects  the availability of debt or equity financing  and the continuing results at our east lost hills project 
we anticipate spending a minimum of approximately million for capital expenditures relating to our existing drilling commitments and related development expenses  and other exploration costs 
to limit capital expenditures  we intend to form industry alliances and exchange an appropriate portion of our interest for cash and or a carried interest in our exploration projects 
we may need to raise additional funds to cover capital expenditures 
these funds may come from cash flow  equity or debt financings  a credit facility  or sales of interests in our properties  although there is no assurance additional funding will be available 
capital expenditures during fiscal  we incurred approximately  for costs relating to drilling and completing wells at our east lost hills project  and for acquiring an additional working interest at east lost hills 
we incurred approximately  for costs related to our other exploration projects including continued leasing and optioning of acreage 
we generated  in revenues from oil and gas production during during fiscal  we incurred approximately  for costs related to continued leasing and optioning of acreage and approximately  for drilling and seismic costs associated with deep exploratory drilling at our east lost hills project 
we had no revenues from oil and gas production during during fiscal  we incurred approximately  for costs related to continued leasing and optioning of acreage   for positions in additional exploration projects in california   for costs relating to seismic and  in drilling costs associated with deep exploratory drilling at our east lost hills project 
we currently anticipate that we will participate in the drilling of from three to seven wells during our fiscal year ending august   although the number of wells may increase as additional projects are added to our portfolio 
however  there can be no assurance that any such wells will be drilled and if drilled that any of these wells will be successful 
our future financial results continue to depend primarily on our ability to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons  the market price for oil and gas  our ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  and our ability to fully implement our exploration and development program with respect to these and other matters 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects or that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production 
results of operations the twelve months ended august  compared with the twelve months ended august  operations during the fiscal year ended august  resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss  for the fiscal year ended august  oil and gas revenues and expenses
