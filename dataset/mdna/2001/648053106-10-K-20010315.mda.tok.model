recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value as issued 
sfas no 
was effective january   however  sfas  deferral of the effective date of sfas  extended the effective date for the company to january the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  this new accounting standard requires companies to carry all derivative instruments  including certain embedded derivatives  in the statement of financial condition at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
the company uses only qualifying hedges that are designated specifically to reduce exposure to interest rate risk by locking in the expected future cash payments on certain liabilities 
this is typically accomplished using an interest rate swap 
for financial reporting purposes  the gain or loss on the interest rate swap is recorded as a component of equity 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
in january  the company recorded a net transition adjustment of  in accumulated other comprehensive income equity at that time 
adoption of the standard also resulted in the company recognizing  of derivative instrument liabilities 
in general  the amount of volatility will vary with the level of derivative activities during any period

funds from operations the company calculates funds from operations ffo as net income attributable to common shareholders on a diluted basis before gain or loss on sales of real estate and securities and before extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate  amortized leasing commission costs and the minority interest share of income 
effective january   the company adopted the nareit definition of ffo which requires the inclusion of both recurring and non recurring results of operations 
the and calculations have been restated to conform to the nareit definition to include non recurring charges 
ffo is not a substitute for cash flows from operations or net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo is presented because industry analysts and the company consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of performance of reits 
the following information is included to show the items included in the company s ffo for the past periods indicated in thousands  except per share amounts year year five months ended ended year ended year ended december  december  december  july  net income before extraordinary item     preferred dividends     minority interest  net income applicable to common shareholders diluted     gains loss on real estate and securities   dilutive preferred a dividends   depreciation and amortization  including depreciation relating to equity investments     impairment of real estate  funds from operations     weighted average of common shares outstanding diluted     ffo per share diluted net cash provided by operating activities     net cash used in investing activities     net cash used in financing activities     series a preferred stock has a dilutive effect on the ffo calculation 
on a pro forma basis  ffo would have been  for the five months ended december   had the merger been consummated on august  economic conditions the majority of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents which generally increase as prices rise but may be adversely impacted by tenant sales decreases  and or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  the company believes that many of its existing lease rates are below current market levels for comparable space and that upon renewal or re rental such rates may be increased to or get closer to current market rates 
this belief is based upon an analysis of relevant market conditions  including a comparison of comparable market rental rates  and upon the fact that many of such leases have been in place for a number of years and may not contain escalation clauses sufficient to match the increase in market rental rates over such time 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans 
many regions of the united states  including regions in which the company owns property  may experience economic recessions 
such recessions  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some existing tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s shopping centers are typically anchored by discount department stores  supermarkets and drug stores which usually offer day to day necessities rather than high priced luxury items 
these types of tenants  in the experience of the company  generally continue to maintain their volume of sales despite a slowdown in economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had approximately million of outstanding floating rate mortgages 
in addition  the company had million outstanding as of december  in connection with floating rate borrowings under credit facilities 
the company does not believe that the interest rate risk represented by its floating rate debt is material as of that date in relation to the approximately billion of outstanding total debt of the company  the approximately billion of total assets of the company and the approximately billion market capitalization of the company s common stock as of that date 
in addition  as discussed below  the company has fixed million of floating rate borrowings through the use of an interest swap 
the company was a party to one hedging agreement with respect to its floating rate debt as of december  on october   the company entered into a two year swap agreement with fleet national bank relating to million of the company s variable rate debt 
the agreement effectively fixes the annual interest rate of this debt at a base rate of plus applicable spreads associated with the company s variable rate credit facilities 
hedging agreements enable the company to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities 
hedging agreements expose the company to the risk that the counterparties to such agreements may not perform  which could increase the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
generally  however  the counterparties to hedging agreements that the company enters into are major financial institutions 
the company may borrow additional money with floating interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefits of existing hedging agreements or any hedging agreements that the company may enter into in the future  would increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect cash flow and the ability of the company to service its debt 
future decreases in interest rates will increase the company s interest expense as compared to the floating rate debt underlying the company s hedging agreements and could result in the company making payments to unwind such agreements 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate debt increase by or approximately basis points  the increase in interest expense on the company s variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest increase by  the fair value of the company s total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate debt decrease by or approximately basis points  the decrease in interest expense on the company s variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decreased by  the fair value of the company s total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
as of december   the company had notes receivable in the total amount of canadian million approximately us million as of december  
the company does not believe that the foreign currency exchange risk associated with these loans is material 
the company had no other material exposure to market risk including foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity price risk as of december
