we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
general during  we accelerated our efforts to develop and commercialize our instant power zinc air long lasting  disposable batteries and chargers for cellular phones 
these devices use the proprietary high rate primary zinc air technology that we developed in the last two years for portable electronic devices 
we also focused during the past year on expanding the distribution channels for our products  in order to make the transition from a research and development company to a global consumer goods company 
most notable among our new distributors was wal mart  with over  outlets throughout the united states  which began marketing our batteries under its everactive brand name in december we have signed several distribution agreements with after market distributors of cellular accessories such as carphone warehouse  circuit city  compusa and the link store  and we have received initial orders from these distributors 
our line of existing products now includes batteries for nokia phones  motorola microtac phones  the ericsson line  the samsung sch phone  and an auxiliary battery for the motorola startac  and chargers with smartcords for various series and models of nokia  motorola  ericsson  panasonic  siemens  samsung  audiovox  mitsubishi  sagem and philips cellphones  models of palm  handspring  hp and compaq pdas and novatel modems 
while we have successfully marketed our products to retailers such as wal mart  certain of our customers have indicated to us in response to slower than anticipated initial sales results that we would benefit from educating consumers as to the advantages of disposable batteries and chargers for cellphones and pdas 
we have begun addressing this need  both on our own and in cooperative programs with certain of our retailers  through an advertising and public relations campaign in national newspapers  in flight and consumer magazines and at major airports  as well as through in store point of sale efforts 
our zinc air cells are produced using a custom designed  high capacity automatic line designed  engineered and built by our personnel and the us equipment supplier 
an automated production line with a monthly capacity in the hundreds of thousands of units began production in the third quarter of during  we continued to invest in strengthening our intellectual property position 
we have unexpired us patents and corresponding european patents issued covering general aspects and various applications of our zinc air technology 
we also have more than new applications filed  focusing specifically on instant power batteries and chargers for consumer electronic devices and cellphones 
we continue to develop other applications for our disposable instant power batteries  including devices for the telecommunications  hand held computer and defense markets 
our electric vehicle division is continuing its american all electric transit bus development project in nevada  subcontracted by the federal transit administration fta and supported by the israel us binational industrial research and development bird foundation 
on july   we announced that we had successfully completed the first actual driving tests of our all battery electric bus 
this event successfully completed phase i of the fta program 
phase ii of the program  which focuses on conducting evaluation of the system and vehicle performance  including track testing and limited on road demonstrations  enhancing the all electric propulsion system developed in phase i  including incorporating ultracapacitors and associated interface controls  and testing and evaluating the zinc air battery system  received approval in the fourth quarter of in january  we agreed to participate in a new cooperative  all electric hybrid vehicle development and demonstration program in germany 
in january  we received a dm million  order for zinc air fuel cells and zinc anodes to be delivered over the course of our safety products division is continuing with the introduction of the new emergency lights for the marine life jackets market  and sales are steadily increasing 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in the sources and amounts of our revenues and expenses  and we believe that the following comparisons of results of operations for the periods presented do not necessarily provide a meaningful indication of our development 
during these periods  we have received periodic lump sum payments relating to licensing and other revenues from our strategic partners  which have been based on the achievement of certain milestones  rather than ratably over time 
our expenses have been based upon meeting the contractual requirements under our agreements with various strategic partners and  therefore  have also varied according to the timing of activities  such as the need to provide prototype products and to establish and engineer refueling and regeneration facilities 
our research and development expenses have been offset  to a limited extent  by the periodic receipt of research grants from israel s office of the chief scientist 
we expect that  because of these and other factors  including general economic conditions and delays due to legislation and regulatory and other processes and the development of competing technologies  future results of operations may not necessarily be meaningfully compared with those of current and prior periods 
thus  we believe that period to period comparisons of its past results of operations should not necessarily be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of batteries and chargers for portable electronic devices  components of the electric fuel electric vehicle system  including refueling and electric fuel services and defense and safety products that we manufacture  as well as from licensing rights to our technology to third parties  there can be no assurance that we will ever derive such revenues or achieve profitability 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
further  we believe that the operations of efl s subsidiaries are an integral part of the israeli operations 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was the result of an increase in revenues from the instant power division that resulted from increased marketing of our instant power batteries for cellular phones  an increase that was only partly offset by the completion of phase i of the fta program and the concomitant drop off in revenues in the electric vehicle division attributable to that program 
during  we recognized revenues from the sale of lifejacket lights and sale of consumer batteries 
we also recognized revenues from subcontracting fees received in connection with the united states department of transportation dot program which began in and  after we completed phase i in july of  was extended in the fourth quarter of we participate in this program as a member of a consortium seeking to demonstrate the ability of the electric fuel battery system to power a full size  all electric transit bus 
the total program cost of phase ii is approximately million  of which will be covered by the dot subcontracting fees 
subcontracting fees cover less than all of the expenses and expenditures associated with our participation in the program 
in  we derived revenues principally from the sale of lifejacket lights and consumer batteries 
additionally  we also recognized revenues from activities related to the dot program 
in  revenues were million for the instant power division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  million for the electric vehicle division compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  and million for the defense and safety division compared to million in  an increase of million  or research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
research and development expenses and cost of revenues totaled million during  compared with million during an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in operations and engineering costs related to new product development and the ramping up of our automated production line 
in  we believed that  given our stage of development  it was not yet meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
we did distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues in in addition to the increase in the overall research and development expenses in  the internal division of expenses also changed between and this was principally attributable to a reduction of expenses related to electric vehicle battery development 
this overall reduction was partially offset by significant increases in the costs associated with consumer product development and the production of increased quantities of lifejacket lights in the defense and safety division 
research and development expenses were reduced by million during as a result of recognition of grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade and the bird foundation 
our research and development grant applications have been approved by the research committee of the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade 
as a result  royalty bearing grants of  from the chief scientist were recognized during compared to  in  a decrease of  or to offset research and development expenses 
in addition   of royalty bearing grants from the bird foundation were recognized during compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses and cost of operations related to instant power and defense and safety applications are expected to continue to increase for  as we intensify our efforts in these new areas 
direct expenses for our three divisions for the fiscal year ended were million for the instant power division million in  an increase of million  or  million for the electric vehicle division million in  a decrease of million  or  and million for the defense and safety division million in  a decrease of million  or 
the shift in expenses from the electric vehicle division to the instant power division was the result of the completion of phase i of the fta program and the increased marketing of our instant power batteries for cellular phones  as discussed above 
net costs of fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation at december  in the instant power  electric vehicle and defense and safety divisions were million  million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expenses in the instant power division during we expect additional increases in selling  general and administrative expenses during  particularly relating to marketing expenses in consumer battery applications  as we continue to expand the applications for our technology 
financial income 
financial income  net of interest expense  exchange differentials  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or  due primarily to higher balances of invested funds as a result of the deposit of the proceeds of private placements of our securities conducted in income taxes 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
taxes in these entities incurred in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
net losses 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared with a net loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared with million for during  we recognized revenues from the sale of lifejacket lights and sale of consumer batteries 
we also recognized revenues from activities related to the dot program  which began in additionally  we recognized revenue during in connection with various defense research and development contracts 
revenues for were principally derived from recognizing the previously deferred advances from the deutsche post as well as from activities relating to the deutsche post field test extension reflecting payment by the deutsche post of expenses we incurred 
additionally  we recognized revenues from the sale of additional batteries to the deutsche post as well as sales of electric fuel vehicle batteries to edison 
we also recognized revenues from the sale of lifejacket lights 
we began recognizing revenues from the activities related to the dot program in the second half of in  revenues were  for the instant power division there were no revenues for this division in   for the electric vehicle division compared to  for  a decrease of  or  and  for the defense and safety division compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
research and development expenses and cost of revenues totaled million during  compared with million during  a decrease of million  or 
we believes that  given our stage of development  it is not yet meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
in addition to the reduction in the overall expenses in  the internal division of expenses also changed between and this was principally attributable to a reduction of expenses related to electric vehicle battery development 
this overall reduction was partially offset by significant increases in the costs associated with consumer battery development and the production of increased quantities of lifejacket lights in the defense and safety division

our research and development grant applications were approved by the research committee of the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade 
as a result  we recognized royalty bearing grants of  from the chief scientist during compared to  in  an increase of  or to offset research and development expenses 
in addition  we recognized  of royalty bearing grants from the bird foundation during compared to  in  an increase of  or 
direct expenses for our three divisions for the fiscal year ended were million for the instant power division million in  no change million for the electric vehicle division million in  a decrease of million  or  and million for the defense and safety division million in  unchanged 
net costs of fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation at december  in the instant power  electric vehicle and defense and safety divisions were   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared with million in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced salaries  professional fees and electric vehicle marketing expenses during financial income 
financial income  net of interest expense  exchange differentials  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in  compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
income taxes 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities incurred in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
net losses 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared with a net loss of million in  a decrease of million  or 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  compared with million as of december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in cash was primarily the result of the private placements of our securities described below 
we used available funds in primarily for continued research and development expenditures  and other working capital needs 
we increased our investment in fixed assets by million during the year ended december   primarily in the instant power division 
our fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
our israeli subsidiary efl presently has a line of credit with the first international bank of israel ltd 
fibi of up to  guaranteed by our receivables up to of the receivables total amount as determined from time to time 
this credit facility imposes financial and other covenants on efc and efl 
as of december   the bank had issued letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling approximately  in december and january  we issued shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock in two private placements 
the aggregate proceeds from these placements  including proceeds upon exercise of the warrants  were approximately million 
during  certain of our employees exercised options under our registered employee stock option plan 
the proceeds to us from the exercised options are approximately million 
on march   we entered into a share and assets purchase agreement to acquire tadiran batteries from koor industries ltd 
for million in our common stock  based on the closing price of per share of our common stock on march   the date on which we and koor reached agreement in principle 
concurrently  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with koor pursuant to which koor was to acquire  shares of our common stock  at per share  for a total cash investment of million 
these agreements were cancelled in connection with the transactions described in the next paragraph 
on may   we entered into a purchase agreement with koor industries ltd 
pursuant to which koor agreed to purchase one million shares of our common stock at per share  for a total cash investment of million 
we and koor also entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we agreed to register the shares issued to koor  and koor agreed to certain limitations on the resale of the shares in the six months following the investment 
the purchase agreement with koor provided that we would issue additional shares to koor based on the extent to which the average closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq for the thirty trading days immediately preceding the six month anniversary of the closing date was below per share 
pursuant to the terms of this provision  we issued an additional  shares of common stock to koor 
as part of the transactions contemplated by this purchase agreement  we and koor agreed  pursuant to a termination and release agreement  that the agreements described in the previous paragraph would be cancelled and that we would not proceed with the previously announced investment by koor or the acquisition by us of koor s subsidiary tadiran batteries ltd 
on november  we issued and sold to capital ventures international  for an aggregate purchase price of million i  shares of our common stock  ii a series a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at any time prior to november  at a price of per share  and iii a series b warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at any time prior to august  at a price of per share 
in connection with this transaction  we also issued two warrants  one a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at per share and one a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at per share  to josephthal co  inc  who acted as our placement agent in connection with this transaction 
we have no long term debt outstanding  and we are using our cash reserves and revenues from operations primarily to continue development of batteries and chargers for consumer electronic devices  as well as to participate in the fta electric vehicle program 
furthermore  in the third quarter of  we established a commercial production line and we are preparing for market penetration of our new instant power zinc air batteries and chargers for several models of cellular telephones and pdas 
approximately of the stock of our israeli based subsidiary efl is now owned directly  indirectly or by application of certain attribution rules by two united states citizens 
if at any time in the future  or more of the shares of efl are held or deemed to be held by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of our stock who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company stock ownership test under the internal revenue code and we could be subject to additional us taxes on any undistributed foreign personal holding company income of efl 
for  efl had no income which would qualify as undistributed foreign personal holding company income 
however  no assurance can be given that in the future efl will not have income that qualifies as undistributed foreign personal holding company income 
we believe that our present cash position and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements through the next year 
we are seeking additional funding  including through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain any such additional funding 
if additional funding is not secured  we intend to further modify  reduce  defer or eliminate certain of our anticipated future commitments and or programs  in order to continue future operations 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations historically  the majority of our revenues have been in us dollars 
the united states dollar cost of our operations in israel  with regard to expenses incurred in nis  is influenced by the extent to which an increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the past two years  inflation in israel has been more than fully compensated by the devaluation of the nis and  accordingly  the dollar cost of our nis expenses has decreased 
even if the recent trend is reversed as was the case in previous years  we do not believe that continuing inflation in israel or delays in the devaluation of the nis are likely to have a material adverse effect on us  except to the extent that such circumstances have an impact on israel s economy as a whole 
in the years ended december   and  the annual rates of inflation in israel were  and  respectively  compared to the devaluation of the nis against the dollar during such periods of  and  respectively 
effective corporate tax rate our production facilities in israel have been granted approved enterprise status under the israel law for encouragement of capital investments   and consequently are eligible for certain tax benefits for seven to ten years after they first generate taxable income provided the maximum period as prescribed by law has not elapsed 
we have elected to receive a grant of funds together with a reduced tax rate for the aforementioned period 
efl s effective corporate tax rate may be affected by the classification of certain items of income as being approved income for purposes of the approved enterprise law  and hence subject to a lower tax rate to  depending on the extent of foreign ownership of efl presently than is imposed on other forms of income under israeli law presently 
the effective tax upon income we distribute to our stockholders would be increased as a result of the withholding tax imposed upon dividends distributed by efl to efc  resulting in an overall effective corporate tax rate of approximately for income arising from efl s approved enterprises and regarding other income 
efc and efl have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december   and and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities paid in  and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that are available to offset future taxable income  expiring primarily in  and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our international sales  production and funding requirements 
our research  development and production activities are primarily carried out by our israeli subsidiary  efl  at its facility in beit shemesh  and accordingly we have sales and expenses in new israeli shekels 
however  the majority of our sales are made outside israel in us dollars  and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred in us dollars 
therefore  our functional currency is the us dollar 
please see impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  above and note b to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although we have a line of credit that may be affected by interest rate changes  given our level of borrowing  we do not believe the market risk from interest rate changes is material
