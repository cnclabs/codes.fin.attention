item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis by our management is provided to identify certain significant factors that affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
overview and risk factors we are a biopharmaceutical company advancing oncology care by developing a portfolio of targeted biologic treatments  which address the unmet medical needs of patients with a variety of cancers 
our three programs include growth factor blockers  cancer vaccines and anti angiogenesis therapeutics 
since our inception in april  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research and clinical institutions 
we have not derived any commercial revenue from product sales 
as a result of our substantial research and development costs  we have incurred significant operating losses and we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception to december  we expect to incur additional operating losses  which could be substantial 
substantially all of our revenues were generated from license and research arrangements with collaborative partners 
such revenues  as well as our results of operations  have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the status of development of our various product candidates the time at which we enter into research and license agreements with corporate partners that provide for payments to us  and the timing and accounting treatment of payments to us under these agreements whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones timely payment by our corporate partners of amounts payable to us the addition or termination of research programs or funding support variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary product candidates during any given period in order for them to be commercialized  our product candidates will require additional development and clinical testing  which will require significant additional funds 
generally  to make a profit we will need to successfully develop  test  introduce and market our products 
it is not certain that any of our products will be successfully developed or that required regulatory approvals to commercialize them can be obtained 
further  even if we successfully develop a product  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture or market that product or that customers will buy it 
in december  we entered into an agreement with merck kgaa  a german based drug company  relating to the development  marketing and sale of imc c under this agreement we have retained the rights to develop and market imc c within the united states and canada  we have granted merck kgaa exclusive rights  except in japan  to develop and market imc c outside of the united states and canada  we have agreed to seek to supply merck kgaa  and merck kgaa will purchase from us  imc c for the conduct of clinical trials and the commercialization of the product outside of the united states and canada  we will co develop and co market imc c in japan with merck kgaa  and we have granted merck kgaa an exclusive license outside of the united states and canada  without the right to sublicense  to certain of our patents to apply to a humanized antibody to the egf receptor on which merck kgaa has performed preclinical studies 
in return  merck kgaa has agreed  subject to the terms of the agreement  to pay us  in up front fees and early cash based milestone payments based upon our achievement of the milestones set forth in the agreement  pay us an additional  if further milestones are achieved for which merck kgaa will receive equity in imclone systems that will be priced at varying premiums to the then market price of the common stock depending upon the timing of the achievement of the respective milestones  provide us  subject to certain terms  a guaranty of a  credit facility relating to the construction of a new imc c product launch manufacturing facility  fund clinical development of imc c outside of the united states and canada  and pay us royalties on future sales of imc c in its territory  if any 
this agreement may be terminated by merck kgaa in various instances  including at its discretion on any date on which a milestone is achieved in which case no milestone payment will be made  or for a one year period after first commercial sale of imc c in merck kgaa s territory  upon merck kgaa s reasonable determination that the product is economically unfeasible in which case merck kgaa is entitled to receive back of up front fees and cash based milestone payments then paid to date  but only out of revenues received  if any  based upon a royalty rate applied to the gross profit from imc c sales or imc c license fees in the united states and canada 
upon termination of the agreement  we would also be required to use our best reasonable efforts to cause the release of merck kgaa as guarantor of the credit facility for our product launch facility were we to utilize the guaranty 
through december   merck kgaa has paid us  in up front and milestone fees which have been recorded as fees potentially refundable to corporate partner and not as revenue due to the fact that they were refundable to merck kgaa in the event a condition relating to obtaining certain collateral license agreements was not satisfied 
in march  this condition was satisfied and approximately  will be recognized as revenue during the first quarter of under the agreement  we are entitled to merck kgaa s guaranty of a  credit facility 
as of march   we have not utilized this guaranty and are exploring ways in which we might alter that portion of the agreement 
merck has also agreed to pay for one half of the outside contract service costs incurred with respect to our multinational phase iii clinical trial using imc c with radiation in head and neck cancer patients 
we have also granted merck kgaa a license to develop and market bec worldwide 
we have retained the right to co promote bec with merck kgaa within north america and it is intended that we will be the bulk manufacturer of bec for worldwide production 
in return  merck kgaa has made research support payments to us totaling  and is required to make milestone payments to us of up to  of which  has been received through december  in addition  merck kgaa is required to make royalty payments to us on any sales of bec outside north america  with a portion of the milestone and research support payments received under the agreement being creditable against the amount of royalties due

we broke ground on the facility in january and estimate that the total cost will be approximately  we have incurred approximately  in engineering  capitalized interest  pre construction and construction costs associated with the product launch manufacturing facility through december  we are funding the cost of this facility through a combination of cash on hand and  if advisable  equipment financing transactions 
total capital expenditures made during the year ended december  were  of which  primarily related to the purchase of equipment for and costs associated with the retrofit of our corporate office and research laboratories in our new york facility   related to engineering  pre construction and construction costs of the product launch manufacturing facility being erected adjacent to our pilot manufacturing facility in new jersey   related to the purchase of land adjacent to our product launch manufacturing facility to accommodate parking facilities for our increased number of employees and the cost of conceptual design and preliminary engineering plans for a second commercial manufacturing facility  which we may build on the land in the future and the remaining  related to improving and equipping our pilot manufacturing facility

we expect to hire regional sales managers and to arrange for the hiring or contracting of a sales force prior to the commencement of imc c sales  if any 
the holder of the series a preferred stock was entitled to receive cumulative dividends at an annual rate of per share 
dividends accrue from the issuance date of the series a preferred stock and are payable on the outstanding series a preferred stock in cash on december of each year beginning december  or at the time of conversion or redemption of the series a preferred stock on which the dividend is to be paid  whichever is sooner 
of its  shares of series a preferred stock  merck kgaa converted  shares in and  shares in into a total of  shares of common stock 
in december we redeemed the remaining  outstanding shares of series a preferred stock for a total redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid dividends of approximately  we also paid merck kgaa a dividend of approximately  in connection with the  shares of series a preferred stock converted in december we believe that our existing cash on hand and amounts expected to be available under our credit facilities should enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least we are also entitled to reimbursement for certain research and development expenditures and to certain milestone payments  including  in cash based milestone payments and  in equity based milestone payments from our imc c development and license agreement with merck kgaa  which are to be paid subject to our attaining research and development milestones  and certain other conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the unachieved milestones 
our future working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to progress and cost of our research and development programs  pre clinical testing and clinical trials our corporate partners fulfilling their obligations to us timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals timing and cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements level of resources that we devote to the development of marketing and sales capabilities costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims technological advances status of competitors our ability to maintain existing and establish new collaborative arrangements with other companies to provide funding to support these activities in order to fund our capital needs after  we will require significant levels of additional capital and we intend to raise the capital through additional arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings  or from other sources including the proceeds of product sales  if any 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail our planned operations 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately  which expire at various dates from through at december  we had research credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates from through under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a corporation s ability to use net operating loss and research credit carryforwards may be limited if the corporation experiences a change in ownership of more than percentage points within a three year period 
since  we have experienced at least two such ownership changes 
as a result  we are only permitted to use in any one year approximately  of our available net operating loss carryforwards that relate to periods before these ownership changes 
similarly  we are limited in using our research credit carryforwards 
we are in the process of determining whether the november public stock offering and the february private placement of convertible subordinated notes will be viewed as additional ownership changes that would further limit the use of our net operating losses and research credit carryforwards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of securities that may include us corporate debt  foreign corporate debt  us government debt  foreign government agency guaranteed debt and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in investment grade fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we invest in securities that have a range of maturity dates 
typically  those with a short term maturity are fixed rate  highly liquid  debt instruments and those with longer term maturities are highly liquid debt instruments with fixed interest rates or with periodic interest rate adjustments 
we also have certain foreign exchange currency risk

interest on the securities is adjusted monthly  quarterly or semi annually  depending on the instrument  using prevailing interest rates 
these holdings are highly liquid and we consider the potential for loss of principal to be minimal 
our convertible subordinated notes in the principal amount of  due march  and other long term debt have fixed interest rates 
the subordinated notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the fair value of fixed interest rate instruments are affected by changes in interest rates and in the case of the convertible notes by changes in the price of the company s common stock
