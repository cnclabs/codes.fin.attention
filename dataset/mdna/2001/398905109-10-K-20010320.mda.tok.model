item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator in the automotive retailing industry 
we own automobile dealership franchises located in texas  oklahoma  florida  new mexico  georgia  colorado  louisiana and massachusetts 
through our dealerships and internet sites  we sell new and used cars and light trucks  and provide maintenance and repair services 
we also operate collision service centers 
we have diverse sources of revenues  including new car sales  new truck sales  used car sales  used truck sales  manufacturer remarketed vehicle sales  parts sales  service sales  collision repair services  finance fees  vehicle service contract commissions  insurance commissions  documentary fees and after market product sales 
sales revenues from new and used vehicle sales and parts and service sales include sales to retail customers  other dealerships and wholesalers 
other dealership revenue includes revenues from arranging financing  vehicle service and insurance contracts  net of a provision for anticipated chargebacks  and documentary fees 
our total gross margin varies as our merchandise mix the mix between new vehicle sales  used vehicle sales  parts and service sales  collision repair service sales and other dealership revenues changes 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services varies significantly  with new vehicle sales generally resulting in the lowest gross margin and other dealership revenue sales generally resulting in the highest gross margin 
when our new vehicle sales increase or decrease at a rate greater than our other revenue sources  our gross margin responds inversely 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact our merchandise mix  and therefore influence our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for sales  administrative  finance and general management personnel  rent  marketing  insurance and utilities 
interest expense consists of interest charges on interest bearing debt  including floorplan inventory financing  net of interest income earned 
we believe that approximately of our selling  general and administrative expenses are variable  allowing us to adjust our cost structure based on business trends

the increase in debt outstanding was primarily attributable to the floorplan borrowings of the additional dealership operations acquired and additional borrowings to complete acquisitions 
further  contributing to the increase was a basis point increase in the weighted average libor 
partially mitigating the libor increase was a basis point rate reduction of the spread charged on our floorplan notes payable  which was effective in may additionally  in december  we received another basis point reduction of the spread charged

a portion of the increase is due to the completion of our offering of million of senior subordinated notes during the first quarter of partially offsetting the increases was a basis point decline in the weighted average interest rate on our floorplan notes payable 
contributing to the rate decline was a rate reduction realized from obtaining a lower interest rate on our floorplan notes payable 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations  our credit facility which includes the floorplan facility and the acquisition facility and equity and debt offerings 
the following table sets forth selected historical information from our statements of cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities 
   net cash provided by used in financing activities   net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows total cash and cash equivalents at december   were million 
operating activities 
for the three year period ended december   we generated million in net cash from operating activities  primarily driven by net income plus depreciation and amortization 
excluding working capital changes  during cash flows from operating activities increased million over the prior year period 
investing activities 
the million of cash used for investing activities during was primarily attributable to cash paid in completing acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from the sales of franchises 
during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of new facilities

financing activities 
we used approximately  during  and obtained approximately million and million during and  respectively  through financing activities 
during we used approximately  in financing activities 
cash was provided primarily through borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we used million for principal payments of long term debt 
additionally  we used million for purchases of treasury stock 
the net cash provided during was generated primarily from our march offerings of million shares of common stock and million of senior subordinated notes 
the net proceeds from these offerings  approximately million  were used to repay million borrowed under the acquisition portion of the credit facility  with the remainder of the proceeds being used in completing acquisitions during additionally  in connection with the sale of properties to a reit  we paid off mortgages of approximately million 
the net cash provided during was generated primarily from drawings on our credit facility and was utilized in completing acquisitions and supporting increased sales volumes 
partially offsetting the million in borrowings was million in principal payments on long term debt  of which million was related to the payoff of mortgages in connection with the sale and leaseback transaction completed in december working capital 
at december   we had working capital of million 
historically  we have funded our operations with internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
certain manufacturers have minimum working capital guidelines  which may limit a subsidiary s ability to make distributions to the parent company 
while we cannot guarantee it  based on current facts and circumstances  we believe we have adequate cash flow coupled with borrowing capacity under our credit facility to fund our current operations 
during we opened a new facility in south florida 
although revenues have experienced a positive trend and the operation is generating positive cash flow  the new facility has not met our expectations 
during the fourth quarter of  a new operator was appointed for the south florida operations 
as part of the management change  we repurchased million shares of our stock from the former operator and others for million and settled various contingent acquisition payments for million 
the funding of these transactions occurred in january stock repurchase the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase a portion of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
our agreements  subject to other covenants  allow us to spend approximately percent of our cumulative net income to repurchase stock 
during we repurchased million shares for million  excluding shares repurchased to fulfill obligations under our employee stock purchase plan 
we anticipate  subject to market conditions  that we will spend approximately million repurchasing stock during capital expenditures our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures exclusive of new or expanded operations have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities  generally  are driven by new franchises being awarded to us by a manufacturer or significant growth in sales at an existing facility 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to expand six existing facilities and prepare three new facilities for operations 
acquisition financing we anticipate investing between million and million in completing tuck in acquisitions during we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from the operating cash flows of our existing dealerships and borrowings under our current credit facilities 
credit facility in december  we amended our credit facility to decrease the commitment from billion to million and reduce the rate charged on our floorplan facility to libor plus basis points 
the credit facility provides a floorplan facility of million for financing vehicle inventories and an acquisition facility of million for financing acquisitions  general corporate purposes and capital expenditures 
the lending group making up the credit facility is comprised of major financial institutions  including five manufacturer captive finance companies 
the manufacturer captive finance companies include ford motor credit company  toyota motor credit company  bmw financial services  na  inc  chrysler financial company  na and mercedes benz credit corporation 
as of march   million is available to be drawn under the acquisition facility  subject to a cash flow calculation and the maintenance of certain financial ratios and various covenants 
the credit facility allows of net income to be paid as cash dividends 
leases we lease various real estate  facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements  including leases with related parties 
generally  the related party and third party leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three five year option periods  at our option 
additionally  we generally have an option to purchase the real estate and facilities at the end of the lease term  and a right of first refusal  giving us the opportunity to purchase the real estate and facilities  if the owner reaches an agreement to sell them to a third party 
dependence on the success of our manufacturers our success depends upon the overall success of the line of vehicles that each of our dealerships sells 
demand for our manufacturers vehicles as well as the financial condition  management  marketing  production and distribution capabilities of our manufacturers affect our business 
our ford  toyota and lexus dealerships represent approximately of our total new vehicle retail sales 
although we have attempted to lessen our dependence on any one manufacturer by buying dealerships representing a number of different domestic and foreign manufacturers  events such as labor disputes and other production disruptions that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also adversely affect us 
similarly  the late delivery of vehicles from manufacturers  which sometimes occurs during periods of new product introductions  can lead to reduced sales during those periods 
moreover  any event that causes adverse publicity involving any of our manufacturers may have an adverse effect on us regardless of whether such event involves any of our dealerships 
impact of acquisitions on growth growth in our revenues and earnings will be impacted by our ability to acquire and successfully operate dealerships 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire dealerships in the future 
in addition  managing and integrating additional dealerships into our existing mix of dealerships may result in substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
restrictions by our manufacturers as well as covenants contained in our debt instruments limit our ability to acquire additional dealerships 
in addition  increased competition for acquisition candidates may develop  which could result in fewer acquisition opportunities available to us and or higher acquisition prices 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including possible diversion of resources and management s attention  inability to retain key acquired personnel and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will continue to need substantial capital in order to acquire additional automobile dealerships 
in the past  we have financed these acquisitions with a combination of cash flow from operations  proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility and issuances of our common stock 
cyclicality our operations  like the automotive retailing industry in general  can be impacted by a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including consumer business cycles  consumer confidence  economic conditions  availability of consumer credit and interest rates 
although the above factors  among others  may impact our business  we believe the impact on our operations of future negative trends in such factors will be somewhat mitigated by our i strong parts  service and collision repair service operations  ii variable cost structure  iii geographic diversity and iv product diversity 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations  with the second and third quarters generally contributing more operating profit than the first and fourth quarters 
three primary forces drive this seasonality i manufacturer related factors  primarily the historical timing of major manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers  ii weather related factors and iii consumer buying patterns 
current business trends during  approximately million new vehicles were sold in the united states 
industry analyst estimates for are predicting new vehicle unit sales of between million and million units  as consumer confidence levels have trended downward from the prior year 
annual sales of million units would rank as the fifth highest total of new vehicle retail sales in the united states during the past years 
with respect to interest rates  the one month libor  which averaged approximately during  has fallen to approximately in march  after reaching a high  during november  of approximately
