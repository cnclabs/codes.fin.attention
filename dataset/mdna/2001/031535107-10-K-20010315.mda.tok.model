item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to company overall sales increased to  from  in  an increase of 
the manufacturing services division sales increased over and as a result contributed most of the overall sales growth 
the increase in label identification machine sales in was offset by the decline in the discontinued distributed surface mount machines compared to no portion of sales is attributable to inflation for gross profit dollars and gross profit percent increased  and in  compared to this increase was due to the higher gross margins earned on the dataplace label identification machine  improved factory utilization and improved gross margins on contract manufacturing services 
the year was burdened with a  addition to the allowance for inventory obsolescence related to placemaster r machines  a  addition to the allowance for inventory related to private label products  and excess plant capacity in the machine division  which depressed margins 
selling expenses decreased  in the current year due to staff reductions  lower machine commission expense  and reduced machine division marketing expenses 
substantially all the dataplace machines were sold on a direct basis and therefore did not require a commission payment to an outside representative 
in  the machine sales were primarily comprised of sales of the smd machines  which required a commission payment as the machines were sold through outside representatives 
general and administrative expense decreased  over the decreased expense was due partially to a  recovery in related to one of several bad debts totaling  that had been reserved for in development efforts in were focused on the second dataplace r label identification machine and on customization orders received related to the dataplace r lp model 
management is currently evaluating further research and development projects for interest income increased  in  compared to  due to higher average cash balances during no federal income tax expense has been recorded in due to the change in the valuation allowance 
uncertainties concerning the company s ability to utilize the benefits of the deferred tax assets in the future preclude it from recording an asset at full value 
therefore a valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred income tax asset 
results of operations compared to  continued machine sales segment in  the machine division made the transition from offering distributed surface mount assembly machines to offering label identification machines 
the company s label identification machines are designed and manufactured in house 
the company shipped label identification machines to predominantly fortune contract manufacturers and oem s 
on january   the company was notified of the establishment of a cooperative relationship between tenryu technics  the manufacturer of the private label machines  and yamaha motor co  ltd 
im operations 
this cooperative relationship led to the formation of a new company named i pulse company ltd 
during during january  the company  following its strategy to reposition itself from smd assembly to label identification machines  chose to no longer carry the distributed machine line 
accordingly  the agreement between the company and i pulse will terminate effective june  the company was able to successfully sell off its remaining distributed machine inventory during the first two quarters of  including ten machines repossessed from pricepoint micro technologies in january the company s through hole machines in the field generate a significant portion of parts and service sales 
however  as population of the company s through hole technology machines declines  demand for spare parts and out of warranty field service has continued to follow a parallel trend 
the company s primary sales and gross margin contributions in previous years have come from the distributed private label machine line  whereas in  the label identification machine was the primary contributor

facing the company s declining position in the smd machine market  management made a strategic decision during to increase its focus and marketing effort in the product identification technology sector 
unlike the smd machine market  with its mature technology  and intense competition  the product identification market was in the early stage of development and under served 
the company commenced production of its first product identification machine model dataplace r lp during the early part of and sold two machines in the later part of the table on page shows that sales of amistar manufactured machines  parts  and service declined during the company discontinued marketing its placemaster r surface mount machine models in during  two placemaster r machines were transferred from inventory to ams as part of a planned expansion of assembly line capacity 
sales generated from the ams division decreased in as compared to an increase of in the loss of a major customer whose financial condition deteriorated  contributed to the sales decline in no portion of sales is attributable to inflation for results of operations compared to  continued gross profit decreased  and as a percentage of sales in  compared to this decrease was due to a negative gross profit realized by the ams division  a  addition to the allowance for inventory obsolescence related to placemaster r machines  a  addition to the allowance for inventory related to private label products  and excess plant capacity in the machine division 
selling expenses decreased  in due to staff reductions and reduced marketing expenses

general and administrative expense increased  over this increase includes an addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts of  related to three companies whose financial condition deteriorated during all three companies were young  rapidly expanding  thinly capitalized companies that the company saw opportunities to grow with 
two of the three companies were severely crippled by the shortage of computer memory chips and the rapid increase of prices in the fourth quarter of in the case of one customer  the entire contract receivable balance was written down to the net realizable value of the equipment repossessed by the company
