item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in risk factors and elsewhere in this filing 
overview virage logic corporation provides embedded memory in the form of semiconductor intellectual property for systems on a chip integrated circuits that power today s internet and high speed communications  computer and consumer products  such as cellular and digital phones  pagers  digital cameras  dvd players  switches and modems 
our memories are optimized for our customers manufacturing processes and are pre tested through actual manufacture of silicon chips at third party foundries 
revenues consist of license fees for our memories  standard and custom memory compilers and software development tools 
licensing of our intellectual property involves a sales cycle of three to six months 
our memories and compilers can be customized for our customers specific manufacturing processes and requirements 
a custom contract would typically call for milestone payments that are defined in the statement of work and program schedule that accompany a master license agreement 
milestone deliveries generally occur over three to six months 
license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  we have no significant remaining obligations to perform  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
license revenues for certain software development tools are recorded ratably over the maintenance term as vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance portion of the revenues does not exist 
license revenues on custom memory compilers are recognized using contract accounting over the period that services are performed under the percentage of completion method 
for such licenses  we determine our progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
a provision for estimated losses on engagements is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
support revenues related to standard and custom memory compilers are not deferred over the life of the license agreement but rather an estimated cost of support is accrued at the time license revenues are recognized 
our experience to date indicates that the level of resource commitment for support is not significant 
currently  license fees represent substantially all of our revenues 
we have agreements with certain third party semiconductor foundries to pay us royalties on their sales of silicon chips manufactured for our fabless customers 
royalty revenues recognized from these agreements for the years ended september  and were  and  respectively 
no royalty revenue was generated in the year ended september  time delays for receiving royalty revenues are due to the typical length of time required for the customer to implement our embedded memories into their design and manufacture and bring to market a product incorporating our memories 
beginning with our custom touch star memory system and cam technologies  in addition to collecting royalties from the third party foundries  we will increase our royalty base by collecting royalties directly from our integrated device manufacturer customers and fabless customers 
to date  we have entered into more than twenty agreements implementing the new royalty structure 
we have been dependent on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our annual revenues in each fiscal year  although the customers comprising this group have changed from time to time 
in fiscal  philips electronics and intel corporation generated and of our revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  no single customer generated more than of our revenues 
in fiscal  ati technologies  mmc networks  national semiconductor and toshiba each generated between and of our revenues 
sales to customers located outside the united states accounted for  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
substantially all of our direct sales representatives and field application 
table of contents engineers are located in the united states and europe and serve our customers in north america and europe 
we are continuing to build a direct sales organization in europe 
in japan and the rest of asia  we use both indirect sales through distributors  as well as direct sales through sales representatives 
all revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
since our inception in november  cost of revenues and our other expense categories have progressively increased as we added personnel and increased the level of our business activities 
we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  and expect that these costs of revenues and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
we have incurred  and will incur in future periods  substantial amortization of stock based compensation  which represents non cash charges incurred as a result of the issuance of stock options to employees at less than their deemed fair value 
these charges are recorded based on the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant 
the deferred stock based compensation balance at september  and was million and million  respectively 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
the amortization of stock based compensation for options granted through september  was approximately million for fiscal  and is estimated to be million in  million in and million in fiscal results of operations years ended september    and the following table lists the percentage of revenues for certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated year ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest and other expenses income tax provision net income loss our total revenues in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year total revenues million million million revenue grew million from to and million from to the increase in revenues was primarily due to continued migration to the micron embedded memory technologies by our customers  introduction of two new types of memory compilers to our area  speed and power asap product line  an additional cam product and the introduction of the star memory system 
royalty revenue from certain third party foundries increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the expansion of our product lines to include the custom touch netcam and star products and from the full year impact of sales of our and micron embedded memory technologies 

table of contents our gross profits in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year gross profit million million million gross profit represented  and of revenues for those periods  respectively 
the increases in gross profit and gross margin between and and and were attributable to increased sales volume and increased license fees from fabless semiconductor companies for standard products that require minimal labor costs for customization 
cost of revenues excludes million  million and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
research and development expenses in fiscal  and were as follows research and fiscal year development expenses million million million research and development expense represented an increase of from to and an increase of from to the increases in research and development expense between and and between and were primarily due to increases in the number of employees from to employees involved in research and development as we expanded into three new product lines and the development of the and micron embedded memory technology  increase in depreciation related to capital spending for both computer hardware and software  offset by the reduction in consulting fees 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  down from in fiscal research and development expense excludes million  million and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  and were as follows sales and fiscal year marketing expenses million million million sales and marketing expense represented an increase of from to and an increase of from to the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to hiring additional personnel and increased expenditures on tradeshows and advertising 
number of employees increased from to from to in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense excludes million  million and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 

table of contents general and administrative expenses in fiscal  and were as follows general and fiscal year administrative expenses million million million general and administrative expense represented an increase of from to and an increase of from to the increase in general and administrative expense between and was primarily the result of increased professional services and fees related to the costs of being a publicly traded company 
the increase between and was the result of additional hiring and expenditures related to expanding the finance  human resources and contracts management departments in anticipation of the company going public 
general and administrative expense excludes million  million and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
with respect to the grant of stock options to employees  our balance sheet reflects deferred aggregate stock based compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended september  and the amount of deferred stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
amortization  net of cancellations  was million  million and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was million   and  for the years ended  and  respectively  principally due to higher average cash balances following the sale of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock in december and our initial public offering in august interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses were   and  for the years ended  and  respectively 
the decrease from to results from the repayment of the outstanding balance under a credit line 
income tax provision 
the provision for income taxes was million   and  for the years ended  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates differed from the combined federal and state rates due primarily to stock based compensation related charges that are non deductible for tax purposes and foreign taxes 
deemed dividend 
in connection with the sale of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock in december  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the year ended september  to accrete the value of the series c redeemable convertible preferred stock to its deemed fair value under applicable accounting rules 
this non cash charge was recorded as an increase in accumulated deficit with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital and was recognized at the date of issuance  which was the period in which the shares became eligible for conversion 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from cash held at september  the decrease in cash balances at september  was due primarily to investment in short term government and mortgage backed securities with maturity dates of less than one year 
operations were funded primarily from revenues received 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we financed our operating losses for fiscal  and through the issuance of notes  borrowing under capital leases and a line of credit  the sale of preferred stock and cash proceeds of million from our august initial public offering 
the company has outstanding obligations under capital leases  with payments due through august at september    was outstanding 
the interest rate on these borrowings is variable and dependent upon market conditions at the time a new lease obligation is executed 
there is no remaining availability under these capital lease lines 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities resulted from a net loss of million adjusted for non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization of million and the amortization of stock based compensation of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  taxes receivable and deferred revenues 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income before non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and amortization of stock based compensation of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable and deferred tax assets and the reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was due to depreciation of  the amortization of stock based compensation of  and increases in accrued payroll and related expenses  accrued expenses related to software purchases and deferred revenues totaling million 
a higher accounts receivable balance of million  a result of a growing customer base  offset the increase in cash for net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in investing activities from to is due primarily to the investment in short term government and mortgage backed securities with maturity dates of less than one year  our strategic investment in atmos corporation and acquisitions of property and equipment  primarily computer software and hardware 
we intend to purchase approximately million of additional capital assets  primarily computer equipment and software  during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  repayment of borrowings by stockholders of  and the payments on capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities in reflects our receipt of million in cash proceeds from the issuance of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock and million in cash proceeds from the initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities in reflects borrowings under our accounts receivable revolving line of credit of million 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our existing and new technologies  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of the introduction of new technologies  expansion of sales and marketing efforts  potential acquisitions and working capital  primarily accounts receivable 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms 
we believe that the company s current capital resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs at least the next twelve months  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that period 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing beyond this time frame 
our capital and operating requirements will depend on many factors  including the levels at which we maintain accounts receivable and increased spending for operating expenses 
our forecast period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially

table of contents risk factors the technology used in the semiconductor industry is rapidly changing and if we are unable to develop new technologies and adapt our existing intellectual property to new processes  we will be unable to attract or retain customers 
the semiconductor industry has been characterized by an increasingly rapid rate of development of new technologies and manufacturing processes  rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent product introductions and ongoing demands for greater speed and functionality 
our future success depends on our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner  and to adapt our existing intellectual property to satisfy the requirements of new processes and our customers 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  or if the enhancements or new generations of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to attract or retain customers and our operating results could be harmed 
our ability to continue developing technical innovations involves several risks  including our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changes in the requirements of semiconductor companies  the emergence of new semiconductor manufacturing processes and our ability to enter into strategic relationships with third party semiconductor foundries to develop and test technologies for these new processes and provide customer referrals  the significant research and development investment that we may be required to make before market acceptance  if any  of a particular technology  the possibility that the industry may not accept a new technology after we have invested a significant amount of resources to develop it  and new technologies introduced by our competitors 
if we are unable to adequately address these risks  our intellectual property will become obsolete and we will be unable to sell our products 
further  as new technologies or manufacturing processes are announced  customers may defer licensing our intellectual property until those new technologies become available or our intellectual property has been adopted for that manufacturing process 
in addition  research and development requires a significant expense and resource commitment 
since we have a limited operating history  we are unable to predict our future resources 
as a result  we may not have the financial and other resources necessary to develop the technologies demanded in the future and may be unable to attract or retain customers 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations for any fiscal quarter may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
because our expenses are largely independent of our revenues in any particular period  we are unable to accurately forecast our operating results 
as a result  if our revenues are below expectations in any quarter  our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for the revenue shortfall may magnify the negative effect of the revenue shortfall 
factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter include large orders unevenly spaced over time  establishment or loss of strategic relationships with third party semiconductor foundries  
table of contents timing of new technologies and technology enhancements by us and our competitors  shifts in demand for products that incorporate our intellectual property  the timing and completion of milestones under customer agreements  the impact of competition on license revenues or royalty rates  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the general economic environment  and changes in development schedules  research and development expenditure levels and product support by us and our customers 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
these factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict our revenues and may cause our operating results to be below market analysts expectations in some future quarters  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
if we are unable to maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with third party semiconductor manufacturers  or foundries  we will be unable to verify our technologies on their processes and license our intellectual property to their customers 
our ability to verify our technologies for new manufacturing processes depends on entering into development agreements with third party foundries to provide us with access to these processes 
in addition  we rely on third party foundries to manufacture our silicon test chips and to provide referrals to their customer base 
we currently have agreements with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  united microelectronics corporation  or umc  and chartered semiconductor manufacturing or chartered 
if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships with these foundries or enter into new agreements with other foundries  we will be unable to verify our technologies for their manufacturing processes 
we would then be unable to license our intellectual property to fabless semiconductor companies that use these foundries to manufacture their silicon chips  which is a significant source of our revenues 
if demand for products incorporating complex semiconductors and embedded memories does not rise  our business may be harmed 
our business and the adoption and continued use of our intellectual property by semiconductor companies depends on the demand for products requiring complex semiconductors and embedded memories  such as cellular and digital phones  pagers  digital cameras  dvd players  switches and modems 
the demand for such products is uncertain and difficult to predict 
a reduction in the demand for products incorporating complex semiconductors and embedded memories or in the general economic environment which results in the cutback of research and development budgets or capital expenditures would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and could harm our business 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has fluctuated between significant economic downturns characterized by diminished demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity  as well as periods of increased demand and production capacity constraints 
the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a downturn and the us economy is facing an economic slowdown that involves lower levels of expenditures by businesses and individuals 
as a result of such fluctuations in the semiconductor industry and the general economic slowdown  we may face a reduced number of design starts  tightening of customers operating budgets  extensions of the approval process for new orders and projects and consolidation among our customers  all of which may harm the demand for our embedded memories and may cause us to experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our operating results 
further  the markets for third party semiconductor intellectual property and embedded memories have emerged only in recent years 
because of the recent emergence of these markets  it is difficult to forecast whether these markets will continue to develop or grow at a rate sufficient to support our business 

table of contents problems associated with international business operations could affect our ability to license our intellectual property 
sales to customers located outside the united states accounted for of our revenues in fiscal and between to of our revenues in the fiscal years to we anticipate that sales to customers located outside the united states will increase and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
in addition  most of our customers that do not own their own fabrication plants rely on third party foundries that may be outside of the united states 
accordingly  our operations and revenues are subject to a number of risks associated with doing business in international markets  including the following managing foreign distributors and sales partners and sharing revenues with such third parties  staffing and managing foreign branch offices  political and economic instability  greater difficulty in collecting account receivables resulting in longer collection periods  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in tax laws and tariffs  compliance with  and unexpected changes in  a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar  timing and availability of export licenses  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and obtaining governmental approvals for certain technologies 
if these risks actually materialize  our international operations may be adversely affected and sales to international customers  as well as those domestic customers that use foreign fabrication plants  may decrease 
if we are unable to continue establishing relationships with semiconductor companies to license our intellectual property  our business will be harmed 
we currently rely on license fees from the sale of perpetual licenses to generate a large portion of our revenues 
these licenses produce large amounts of revenue in the periods in which the license fees are recognized  but are not necessarily indicative of a commensurate level of revenue from the same customers in future periods 
in addition  our agreements with our customers do not obligate them to license new or future generations of our intellectual property 
as a result  the growth of our business depends significantly on our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers 
we face numerous challenges in entering into license agreements with semiconductor companies on terms beneficial to our business  including the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential licensee  competition with the internal design teams of semiconductor companies  and the need to persuade semiconductor companies to rely on us for critical technology 

table of contents these factors may make it difficult for us to maintain our current relationships or establish new relationships with additional licensees 
further  there is a finite number of fabless semiconductor companies and integrated device manufacturers to which we can license our intellectual property 
if we are unable to establish and maintain these relationships  we will be unable to generate license fees and our revenues will decrease 
our international operations may be adversely affected by instability in the countries in which we operate we recently established a subsidiary in israel  and we expect to continue expanding our direct sales force in europe 
in addition  a growing portion of our intellectual property is being developed in development centers located in the republic of armenia and india 
israel has recently faced an increased level of violence and terror and armenia  only independent since  has suffered significant political and economic instability 
accordingly  continued and heightened unrest in areas of the world in which we operate may adversely affect our business in a number of ways  including the following changes in the political or economic conditions in armenia and the surrounding region  such as fluctuations in exchange rates  changes in laws protecting intellectual property  the imposition of currency transfer restrictions or limitations  or the adoption of burdensome trade or tax policies  procedures  rules  regulations or tariffs  could adversely affect our ability to develop new products  to take advantage of the cost savings associated with operations in armenia  and to otherwise conduct business effectively in armenia  our ability to continue conducting business in israel and other countries in the normal course may be adversely affected by increased risk of violence and terror and our employees working and visiting in israel may be affected by terrorist attacks  our israeli customers demand for our products may be adversely affected because of negative economic consequences associated with reduced levels of safety and security in israel 
general economic conditions and recent terrorist attacks may reduce our revenues and harm our business as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown in the united states and in other parts of the world  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases and investments 
in addition  the september  terrorist attacks in new york city  washington  dc and pennsylvania and the anthrax related terrorist attacks could further contribute to the slowdown in the us economy 
the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult to predict  but if businesses or consumers defer or cancel purchases of new products that contain embedded memories  purchases by fabless semiconductor companies and integrated device manufacturers and production levels by semiconductor manufacturers could decline causing our revenues to be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing our royalty based revenues  our revenues and profitability may not be as large as we anticipate 
we have historically generated revenues almost entirely from license fees 
we have agreements with certain third party semiconductor foundries to pay us royalties on their sales of silicon chips they manufacture for our fabless customers 
for the years ended september  and  we recorded approximately  and  respectively  of royalty revenues 
beginning with our custom touch star memory system and cam technologies  in addition to collecting royalties from third party semiconductor foundries  we intend to increase our royalty base by collecting royalties directly from our integrated device manufacturer and fabless customers 
the continued growth of our revenues depends in part on increasing our royalty revenues  but we may not be successful in convincing all customers to agree to pay us royalties 
additionally  these royalty arrangements may not provide us with the anticipated benefits as sales of products incorporating our intellectual property may not offset lower license fees 
although we have the right to audit the records of semiconductor manufacturers and fabless semiconductor companies  we face risks relating to the accuracy and completeness of the royalty collection process  due to our limited experience and systems in place to conduct reviews of the accuracy of royalty reports we receive from our customers 
in addition  many factors beyond our control  such as fluctuating sales volumes of products that incorporate our intellectual property  commercial acceptance of these products  accuracy of revenue reports and difficulties in the royalty collection process  limit our ability to forecast our royalty revenues 
we have a long and variable sales cycle  which can result in uncertainty and delays in generating additional revenues 
historically  because of the complexity of our products  it can take a significant amount of time and effort to explain the benefits of our products and to negotiate a sale 
for example  it generally takes at least three to six months after our first contact with a prospective customer before we start licensing our intellectual property to that customer 
in addition  purchase of our products is usually made in connection with new design starts  which are out of our control 
accordingly  we may be unable to predict accurately the timing of any significant future sales of software licenses 
we may also spend substantial time and management attention on potential licenses that are not consummated  thereby foregoing other opportunities 

table of contents we rely on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues 
we have been dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our annual revenues in each fiscal year  although the customers comprising this group have changed from time to time 
in fiscal  philips electronics and intel corporation generated and of our revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  no single customer generated more than of our revenues 
in fiscal  ati technologies  mmc networks  national semiconductor and toshiba each generated between and of our revenues for a total of of our revenues 
we expect a small number of companies in the aggregate to represent between to of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
the license agreements we enter into with our customers do not obligate them to license future generations of our intellectual property and  as a result  we cannot predict the length of our relationship with any of our significant customers 
as a result of this customer concentration  we could experience a dramatic reduction in our revenues if we lose one or more of our significant customers and are unable to replace them 
the market for embedded memory is highly competitive  and we may lose market share to larger competitors with greater resources and to companies that develop their own memory technologies using internal design teams 
we face competition from both existing suppliers of embedded memories as well as new suppliers that may enter the market 
we also compete with the internal design teams of large  integrated device manufacturers 
many of these internal design teams have substantial programming and design resources and are part of larger organizations with substantial financial and marketing resources 
these internal teams may develop technologies that compete directly with our technologies or may actively seek to license their own technologies to third parties 
many of our existing competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and larger customer bases  as well as greater financial and marketing resources  than we do 
this may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
it may also allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their products 
in addition  the intense competition in the market for embedded memory could result in pricing pressures  reduced license revenues  reduced margins or lost market share  any of which could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel who are critical to the success of our business 
we believe that one of our significant competitive advantages is the size and quality of our engineering team 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain engineers and other highly skilled personnel and senior managers 
in addition  in order to meet our planned growth we must increase our sales force  both domestic and international  with qualified employees 
hiring qualified technical  sales and management personnel is difficult due to a limited number of qualified professionals and competition in our industry for these types of employees 
we have in the past experienced delays and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel and believe that at times our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and start up companies 
our employees are at will and may leave our employment at any time  and under certain circumstances  start up companies can offer more attractive stock option packages than we offer 
as a result  we may experience significant employee turnover 
failure to attract and retain personnel  particularly sales and technical personnel  would make it difficult for us to develop and market our technologies 
in addition  our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key personnel  including adam a 
kablanian  our president and chief executive officer  and alexander shubat  our vice president of engineering and chief technical officer 
we do not have formal employment agreements with mr 
kablanian or mr 
shubat and do not maintain key man life insurance policies on their lives 
if mr 
kablanian or mr 
shubat were to leave or become unable to perform services for our company  our business would be severely harmed 

table of contents we may be unable to deliver our customized memory products in the time frame demanded by our customers  which could damage our reputation and future sales 
a significant portion of our contracts require us to provide customized products within a set delivery timetable 
we have experienced delays in the progress of certain projects in the past  and we may experience such delays in the future 
any failure to meet significant customer milestones could damage our reputation in our industry and harm our ability to attract new customers 
we may need additional capital that may not be available to us and  if raised  may dilute our stockholders ownership interest in us 
we may need to raise additional funds to develop or enhance our technologies  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
additional financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
we may have difficulty sustaining profitability and may experience losses in the future 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded net income of  this was our first profitable quarter on a reported gaap basis 
in order to sustain profitability  we will need to continue to generate new sales while controlling our costs 
as we plan on continuing the growth of our business and expect to increase the size of our company in the next twelve months  we may not be able to successfully generate enough revenues to remain profitable with this growth 
any failure to increase our revenues and control costs as we pursue our planned growth would harm our profitability and would likely negatively affect the market price of our stock 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our business may be harmed 
our future success depends on our ability to successfully manage our growth 
our ability to manage our business successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
our customers rely heavily on our technological expertise in designing and testing our products 
relationships with new customers may require significant engineering resources 
as a result  any increase in the demand for our products will increase the strain on our personnel  particularly our engineers 
from the year ended september  to  we grew from to full time employees  have increased our international presence and have increased substantially the number of our customers 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant strain on our managerial and financial resources as well as our limited financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
although some new controls  systems and procedures have been implemented  our future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis  together with maintaining effective cost controls 
since our growth has occurred over such a limited time period  we do not have sufficient experience managing the current size of our business to be able to fully assess our ability to continue to manage its growth in the future 
our inability to manage any future growth effectively would be harmful to our revenues and profitability 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we may attempt to acquire businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
we believe that future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
since we will not be able to accurately predict these difficulties and expenditures  it is possible that these costs may outweigh the value we realize from a future acquisition 
future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders ownership interest  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or 
table of contents expenses related to the valuation of goodwill or other intangible assets and the incurrence of large  immediate write offs 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property adequately  we will have less proprietary technology to license  which will reduce our revenues and profits 
our patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property are critical to our success 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  mask work and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that the us patent and trademark office will issue patents or trademark registrations for any of our pending applications 
further  any patents or trademark rights that we hold or may hold in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we have not attempted to secure patent protection in foreign countries  and the laws of some foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property as well as the laws of the united states 
also  the portion of our intellectual property developed outside of the united states may not receive the same copyright protection that it would receive if it was developed in the united states 
as we increase our international presence  we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor the development of competing technologies that may infringe on our rights as well as unauthorized use of our technologies 
we use licensing agreements  confidentiality agreements and employee nondisclosure and assignment agreements to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information and to obtain ownership of technology prepared on a work for hire basis 
even though we have taken all customary industry precautions  we cannot be sure that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property rights and deter misappropriation of these rights or that we will be able to detect unauthorized uses and take immediate or effective steps to enforce our rights 
since we also rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect some of our proprietary technology  we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or disclose that technology 
we also cannot be sure that we can ultimately protect our rights to our unpatented proprietary technology 
in addition  third parties might obtain patent rights to such unpatented trade secrets  which they could use to assert infringement claims against us 
third parties may claim we are infringing or assisting others to infringe their intellectual property rights  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from licensing our technology 
while we do not believe that any of our technology infringes the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology 
as a result  third parties may claim we or our customers are infringing their intellectual property rights 
our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions related to our technology 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming  and divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved makes any outcome uncertain 
if we do not prevail in any infringement action  we may be required to pay significant damages and may be prevented from developing some of our technology or from licensing some of our intellectual property for certain manufacturing processes unless we enter into a royalty or license agreement 
in addition  if challenging a claim is not feasible  we might be required to enter into royalty or license agreements in order to settle a claim and continue to license or develop our intellectual property  which may result in significant expenditures 
we may not be able to obtain such agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all  and thus  may be prevented from licensing or developing our technology 
changes to accounting standards and rules could either delay our recognition of revenues or reduce the amount of revenues that we may recognize at a specific time  and thus defer or reduce our profitability 
these effects on our reported results could cause our stock price to be lower than it otherwise might have been 
we adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as of october  in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we implemented these provisions as of october  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements which summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting 
table of contents principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
additional accounting guidance or pronouncements in the future could affect the timing of our revenue recognition in the future  which could cause our operating results to fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts 
in addition  changes to accounting policies that affect other aspects of our business  such as employee stock option grants may adversely affect our reported financial results 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks our core business  the sale of semiconductor intellectual property for the memory elements of systems on a chip  has limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
a significant portion of our customers are located in asia  canada and europe 
however  to date  our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations has been minimal because our license agreements provide for payment in us dollars 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
international operations have not been material  therefore  we do not anticipate our future results to be materially adversely impacted by changes in these factors 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states government obligations and mortgage backed securities and commercial paper 
our investments balance of million at september  consists of instruments with original maturities of days to one year 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio and our intent to hold these investments to maturity  we do not believe our investment balance is materially exposed to interest rate risk
