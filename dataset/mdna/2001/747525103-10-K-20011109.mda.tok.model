ktfreetel s wireless multimedia service runs on a cdma x high speed data network and is available to end users on color display handsets 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sec staff subsequently amended sab to provide registrants with additional time to implement the standard 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal  applied retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal the effect of the adoption of sab on our results of operations for fiscal  when applied retroactively  was to decrease revenue by million and to increase the loss before income taxes and accounting change by million 
we recorded a million loss  net of taxes of million  as the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal to reflect the deferral of revenue and expenses related to future periods 
for fiscal  we recognized million in net income before income taxes and accounting change related to revenue and expense that was recognized in prior years 
prior to the adoption of sab  we generally recorded revenue from non refundable license fees on the effective date of the applicable license agreement 
after the adoption of sab  license fees are recognized 
table of contents ratably over the estimated period of future benefit to the licensee 
royalty revenue continues to be recorded as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
prior to the adoption of sab  we recorded revenue from hardware product sales at the time of shipment  or when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  if later 
after adoption of sab  revenue and expense from certain hardware product sales contracted with a continuing service obligation that is essential to the functionality of the hardware are recognized ratably over the shorter of the estimated life of the hardware product or the expected service period 
revenue from hardware product sales without such a continuing service obligation is recorded when risk of loss and title pass to the customer 
messaging revenue continues to be recorded as earned 
we were required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as of the beginning of fiscal fas requires certain derivative instruments to be recorded at fair value 
after adoption of fas  unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in the statement of operations 
we recorded a million gain  net of taxes of million  as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect of the accounting change related primarily to the recognition of the unrealized gain on a warrant to purchase  shares of leap wireless common stock issued to us in connection with our spin off of leap wireless in september additionally  we recorded million in pre tax unrealized losses on derivative instruments during fiscal  primarily resulting from a decline in the market price of leap wireless stock which reduced the fair value of the leap wireless warrant 
the new requirement to record unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in the statement of operations may cause substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in operating results due to stock market volatility 
strategic investments and financing we make strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications 
in general  we enter into strategic relationships with cdma carriers and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry 
qualcomm ventures  an internal organization  selects and manages strategic investments in early stage companies and  from time to time  venture funds or incubators  to support the adoption of cdma and use of the wireless internet 
most of our strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment  if at all 
to the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic objectives  we attempt to make regular periodic sales that are recognized in investment expense income 
during fiscal  we may reduce the planned sale of certain equity investments until market conditions improve 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary  we will record a charge to investment expense income 
during fiscal year  we recognized million in charges related to other than temporary losses on marketable and private securities 
in december  we announced a new cdma license program designed to allow selected early stage companies to issue equity to us as a means of paying part of the license fees payable under our cdma license agreements 
we record license fee revenues based on the fair value of the equity instruments received  if determinable 
the measurement date for determination of fair value is the earlier of the date on which the parties establish a commitment to perform or the date at which the performance is complete 
the evaluation procedures used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  examining the current market price for the shares if the licensee is publicly traded  examining recent rounds of financing and the licensee s business plan if not publicly traded  and performing other due diligence procedures 
this program will not affect the licensees obligations to pay royalties under their cdma license agreements 
the amount of cash consideration and the timing of revenue recognition varies depending on the terms of each agreement 
during fiscal year  we received million in equity consideration for new or expanded licenses 
in addition  we accepted million in equity in satisfaction of cash license fee receivables during fiscal year at september   seven licensees have participated in this program 

table of contents the vesper companies in fiscal  we made commitments to invest approximately million in the vesper companies 
the vesper companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern region and in the sao paulo state of brazil 
we subsequently participated in additional financing rounds completed by the vesper companies  thereby increasing our initial equity investment 
in addition  we extended long term financing to the vesper companies related to our financing arrangement with ericsson 
at september   our cumulative cash investment  including long term financing  in the vesper companies totaled approximately million 
in january  we acquired an approximate interest in velocom  an investor in the vesper companies  for million 
in december  we executed a term loan agreement with velocom in which we agreed to provide million of convertible debt financing  including million for capitalized interest 
the debt facility has a three year term and bears interest at 
we funded approximately million under this facility through september  as a result of a reorganization of the vesper companies initiated during fiscal  we reassessed the recoverability of our assets related to the vesper companies and velocom and recorded million in asset impairments and related charges  million in investment expense income and million in other non operating charges 
at september   we had approximately million in remaining net assets  primarily consisting of finance receivables and notes receivable related to the vesper companies and velocom 
the vesper companies are working to accomplish the terms of their restructuring with owners  vendors and creditors  which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of our fiscal the proposed transaction is contingent on several factors  and there is a risk it will not close 
if the transaction closes  we expect to acquire an additional interest in the vesper companies for million in equity commitments 
we also expect to convert our term loan agreement with velocom into an additional equity interest in velocom 
after the close  we expect to hold a interest in velocom  and direct and indirect interests in the vesper companies of and  respectively 
we believe the vesper companies represent a strategic opportunity with their extensive installed cdma network in brazil  including the key cities of sao paulo and rio de janeiro 
the vesper companies debt would be reduced in the proposed restructuring from approximately billion to less than million 
additionally  the term of the remaining debt would be extended through  providing the vesper companies significant operational flexibility to support a growing business 
if the proposed restructuring transaction closes  we intend to support the vesper companies while they  together with velocom  seek to partner with strategic investors and internationally recognized operators who have the ability to successfully enhance the vesper companies business and ultimately assume majority control 
we would also consider other strategic alternatives such as spinning off our investment in the vesper companies to our shareholders 
we will consolidate the results of the vesper companies if the proposed transaction closes in fiscal the vesper companies expect to incur increasing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as they expand operations and enter new markets  even if and after they achieve positive cash flows from operations in the initial operating markets 
we may incur significant losses in the future related to our proposed ownership of the vesper companies  and we cannot assure you that the vesper companies will ever operate profitably 
nextwave telecom inc in november  we purchased  shares of series b common stock in nextwave telecom inc nextwave  a privately held company  for million 
as part of the share purchase  we received warrants to buy  additional shares of series b common stock at per share 
during march  we converted a million note receivable into  shares of series b common stock 
in june  we recorded a million impairment charge related to our investment in nextwave 
subsidiaries of nextwave filed for bankruptcy protection in june under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
nextwave itself filed for bankruptcy protection in december under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in august  nextwave filed a plan of reorganization with the united states bankruptcy court which requires total financing of approximately billion to build out an advanced g wireless network 
the plan provides for payment of all valid claims against nextwave  including the claim of the fcc for the pcs 
table of contents licenses it granted to nextwave in  plus interest as applicable 
the plan also provides that nextwave s debt for its c block and f block pcs licenses would be reinstated  with the government receiving all amounts due up to this point  in full  with the remaining balance to be paid in installments 
under this plan  nextwave indicated that it expects to construct wireless networks in markets utilizing cdma xev do technology 
during fiscal  we sold  shares of nextwave series b common stock and recorded a realized gain of million 
at september   we owned  shares of series b common stock and held warrants to purchase  shares of series b common stock for per share 
we also held a million promissory note convertible into  shares of series c common stock 
in august  we committed to purchase  shares of series a preferred stock in the reorganized nextwave for million 
our investment was subject to approval by the united states bankruptcy court  successful consummation of nextwave s august plan of reorganization  satisfactory resolution of all disputes involving nextwave s pcs licenses and other conditions 
furthermore  our obligation to make this investment was subject to approval by the bankruptcy court on or before october  of the terms and conditions of our investment  as well as a certain technology cooperation agreement dated as of august   as amended  between nextwave and us 
nextwave also was entitled to terminate the investment commitment if a certain break up fee contained in the subject subscription agreement was not approved by the bankruptcy court on or before october  the approvals required by october  have not been obtained  and we are entitled to terminate our investment agreement with nextwave 
furthermore  on november   nextwave s bankruptcy counsel publicly announced that a settlement with the fcc had been reached pursuant to which nextwave would relinquish its c block and f block pcs licenses in return for a cash payment from the fcc 
nextwave s bankruptcy counsel indicated that if the settlement receives the necessary approvals  then nextwave intends to file a new plan of reorganization which takes into account the terms of the settlement 
our million commitment is dependent on nextwave pursuing the plan of reorganization filed in august  accordingly  if nextwave does abandon the plan filed in august  and proceeds with a new plan  then we will not be obligated to make the investment 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding nextwave s financing plans  the terms of the settlement announced november  and other factors  there is significant uncertainty as to whether we will have the opportunity to make our planned investment in a reorganized nextwave 
globalstar lp we have contracts with globalstar to design  develop and manufacture subscriber products and ground telecommunications equipment 
on january   globalstar announced that  in order to have sufficient funds available for the continued progress of its marketing and service activities  it had suspended indefinitely principal and interest payments on all of its debt  including its vendor financing obligations 
as a result  globalstar did not make an approximate million payment for principal and interest due to us on january  globalstar also announced the retention of a financial adviser to assist in developing future initiatives  including restructuring globalstar s debt  identifying funding opportunities and pursuing other strategic alternatives 
efforts  by globalstar  to restructure its debt are on going  and work on a final plan is expected to continue 
however  globalstar s restructuring has not progressed as we had anticipated 
based on the current status of globalstar s restructuring efforts  we believe that we will not receive any of the contractual amounts due 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in net charges to establish reserves against remaining globalstar related assets 
during fiscal  we recorded total net charges of million in cost of revenues  million in asset impairment and related charges  million in investment expense and million in other non operating charges related primarily to the impairment of certain assets 
we expect globalstar related revenues to be negligible for fiscal other in march  our wholly owned subsidiary  g investments australia pty limited  was awarded x mhz licenses in the australian g wireless spectrum auctions for approximately million 
we entered the auctions to acquire appropriate spectrum to support a high capacity cdma x xev do 
table of contents system in australia  a country with significant cdma growth prospects 
our successful participation in numerous spectrum auctions in the past has resulted in nationwide cdma networks being deployed in other countries  including mexico  chile and brazil 
we are preparing to deploy cdma x xev do networks in australia with commercial g services planned in the licenses can be used for commercial service starting in october the licenses will cover a total of million potential customers in eight major markets  including sydney  melbourne  brisbane  adelaide  perth  hobart  darwin and canberra 
in october  we agreed to invest million in the convertible preferred shares of inquam limited inquam 
inquam was formed to acquire  own  develop and manage wireless communications systems  either directly or indirectly  with the primary intent of deploying cdma based technology 
in addition  we advanced million under a promissory note  bearing interest at  that matures on january  at september   million of the equity funding commitment is outstanding 
we expect to fund the remaining commitment through june we provided financing to pegaso under an equipment loan and a bridge facility 
pegaso operates a wireless network in mexico 
at september   million and million are outstanding under the equipment loan and the bridge facility  respectively  net of deferred interest and unearned fees 
the bridge facility was payable in full on september  or august  if certain milestones were met  including the completion of a strategic sale or merger with a third party 
the bridge facility was amended in october to  among other things  change the timing of milestones required for the august  maturity from september to october  a strategic sale or merger was not completed by october   such that pegaso failed to meet covenants in both the amended bridge facility and the equipment loan 
on october   pegaso also failed to make a scheduled payment of approximately million on the equipment loan  pegaso is currently engaged in strategic discussions with a third party for a potential sale or merger  and we are actively working with pegaso and the third party to complete a transaction or  alternatively  to assist pegaso in raising additional funds 
as the transaction did not close on the targeted date of october  and such additional financing is not certain  we ceased accruing interest on these loans effective at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter of the bridge facility is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of pegaso s assets 
we also have a commitment to provide an additional million in long term financing under an arrangement with ericsson  subject to pegaso meeting certain conditions 
pegaso is at an early stage of development and  if it remains independent  may not be able to compete successfully 
competitors in mexico have greater financial resources and more established operations than pegaso 
as is normal for early stage wireless operators  pegaso is experiencing significant losses from operations 
pegaso also has limited cash available to meet its operating and financing commitments and is therefore dependent on securing additional financing or completing a strategic arrangement with an existing carrier 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues for fiscal were  million compared to  million for fiscal total revenues for fiscal included million in revenue related to the terrestrial based cdma wireless consumer phone business which was sold in february excluding the revenue of the business sold from fiscal  total revenues decreased by million in fiscal the decrease is primarily related to the implementation of sab in fiscal  lower revenues related to the business with globalstar  offset by higher royalties  higher unit shipments and average selling prices of msm integrated circuits  higher csm infrastructure integrated circuit revenues  and higher omnitracs messaging revenue

income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the annual effective tax rate was negative for fiscal  compared to a rate for fiscal the estimated annual effective tax rate is negative primarily as a result of foreign taxes paid for which it is more likely than not we will not receive a tax benefit 
the difference in the tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the loss for fiscal resulting from certain asset impairment and related charges 
we have provided a valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to the expectation that deductions from future employee stock option exercises will exceed future taxable income 
our net deferred tax assets increased by million in fiscal  and the resulting increase in the valuation allowance was reflected in part as an increase to the tax expense and in part as a reduction of stockholders equity

table of contents our segment results for fiscal compared to fiscal cdma technologies segment qct qct segment revenues for fiscal were  million compared to  million fiscal earnings before taxes for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal revenues increased due to higher unit shipments and average selling prices of msm integrated circuits and higher shipments of csm infrastructure integrated circuit voice channels to wireless communications manufacturers 
the decrease in earnings before taxes was primarily due to increased research and development  as well as increased general  administrative  selling and marketing expenses 
the increased research and development is primarily associated with new integrated circuit product and technology initiatives to support high speed wireless internet access and multi band  multimode  multi network  products including cdmaone  cdma x xev do  gsm gprs  wcdma and position location technologies  as well as increased advertising expenses for these products 
approximately million msm integrated circuits were sold during fiscal  compared to approximately million for fiscal approximately nine million csm infrastructure integrated circuits equivalent voice channels were sold during fiscal  compared to approximately two million for fiscal technology licensing segment qtl qtl segment revenues for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal earnings before taxes for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal the increase in revenues and earnings before taxes was primarily due to an increase in royalties resulting from an increase in worldwide demand for products based on cdma technologies  offset by the impact of adopting sab earnings before taxes included million in other income related to the irrevocable transfer of a portion of an fcc auction discount voucher to a third party 
wireless systems segment qws qws segment revenues for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal earnings before taxes for fiscal of million compared to earnings before taxes of million for fiscal revenues and earnings decreased primarily due to significantly lower shipments of globalstar portable and fixed phones to service providers and the decision to not recognize revenue on business with globalstar before cash is received  offset by an increase in omnitracs messaging services revenue 
we shipped approximately  omnitracs and other related communications systems during fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal the decrease in unit shipments is due to united states economic conditions affecting the domestic long haul trucking industry 
we shipped less than globalstar portable and fixed phones in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in unit shipments is primarily due to the pending restructuring of globalstar and other uncertainties related to the globalstar business 
given the current reduced level of business related to globalstar  we have transferred a number of our qws staff into other parts of our business to meet staffing needs 
liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of  million at september   including interest to be earned thereon  will be used to fund our working and other capital requirements  including investments in other companies and other assets to support the growth of our business  financing for customers of cdma infrastructure products in accordance with the agreement with ericsson  financing under agreements with cdma telecommunications carriers  and other commitments 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt and equity issuance 
on july   we announced that we no longer plan to spin off our integrated circuits and system software business 
although we are withdrawing the plan to spin off this business  we would reconsider if conflicts arise that adversely affect our ability to operate each business in the best interests of our stockholders

future accounting requirements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statements nos 
and fas and fas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas replaces apb and eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
fas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under fas  goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk 
we have fixed income securities consisting of cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities 
investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale and held to maturity 
interest income earned on our short term investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  while interest income earned on long term fixed income investments is not affected in the near term 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about investments in marketable debt securities 
finance receivables bear interest at both fixed and variable rates see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about finance receivables 
interest earned on certain finance receivables is at variable interest rates and is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates and or libor 
fair values will vary as interest rates change 
we have other notes receivable from third parties included in other assets 
these facilities bear interest at variable rates 
interest earned on credit facilities included in other assets is affected by changes in libor  and fair value will vary as interest rates change 

table of contents the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
all financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
for our fixed income investment portfolio  finance receivables and credit facilities in other assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average yield at cost and contractual interest rates for fixed income securities and finance receivables or other credit facilities  respectively  by expected maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that our fixed income securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate dollars in millions no single fair thereafter maturity total value fixed income securities interest rate finance receivables fixed rate interest rate variable rate libor margin over libor credit facilities in other assets fixed rate interest rate variable rate libor margin over libor equity price risk 
we hold available for sale securities and derivative instruments subject to equity price risk 
available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments recorded at fair value under fas and fas  respectively  subject us to equity price risk 
the fair values of available for sale securities total million and million  respectively  at september  and at september  the fair values of these securities are based on the market prices of the securities 
to the extent we own a large number of securities relative to the trading volumes of these securities  the market prices may be higher than the prices we would realize if our shares were sold 
the available for sale securities are held for purposes other than trading 
as of september   two securities constituted approximately of the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio 
we received a warrant in connection with the leap wireless spin off to purchase leap wireless common stock at per share 
at september   we are entitled to purchase  shares of leap wireless common stock see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policy for this instrument and further information 
the recorded and fair values of the warrant are million and million  respectively  at september  and at september  the estimated fair value of the warrant is directly correlated to movements in the price of the leap wireless stock 
the warrant is held for purposes other than trading 
during fiscal  we recorded million in losses on derivative instruments  offset by a million accounting change  net of income taxes  primarily related to this warrant 
we strategically invest in companies in the high technology industry  and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
during fiscal  many high technology stocks experienced a significant decrease in value  negatively affecting the fair value of our available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments 
investment concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect the overall price volatility 

table of contents our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments accounted for under the equity and cost methods that are predominantly closely held and not publicly traded 
these investments are held for purposes other than trading 
accordingly  we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material 
additionally  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures 
foreign exchange market risk 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies and information about our currency exposure management practices 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of forward contracts 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september  we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding  no such contracts were outstanding at september  the amount of the unrealized loss as of september  is not material 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations  which may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
at the present time  we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could suffer unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
finance receivables and notes receivable from international carriers that do not use the united states dollar as their functional currencies subject us to credit risk 
because our financing is dollar denominated  any significant change in the value of the dollar against the debtors functional currencies could result in an increase in the debtor s cash flow requirements and could thereby affect our ability to collect our receivables 
at september   finance receivables from international customers totaled million 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
