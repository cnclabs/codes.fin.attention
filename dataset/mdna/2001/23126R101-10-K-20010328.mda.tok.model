item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genomics based biopharmaceutical company 
we apply proprietary technologies to discover genes and proteins  and to determine how these genes and proteins function in healthy and diseased states 
we use this information to develop products on our own behalf  and in collaboration with other companies  in order to improve human health  animal health  and the vitality of agriculture 
we have established internal drug discovery and development programs that are focused upon developing products to treat humans afflicted by diseases such as obesity and diabetes  cancer  autoimmunity and inflammation  and central nervous system disorders 
we are developing protein drugs on our own behalf  have established a collaboration with abgenix  inc abgenix to develop antibody drugs across all diseases areas  and have established a collaboration with bayer ag bayer to develop small molecule drugs to treat obesity and diabetes 
we are currently investigating additional collaborations to develop small molecule drugs across other disease areas 
we were incorporated in november and  until march  were engaged primarily in organizational activities  research and development of our technology  grant preparation and obtaining financing 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over the next several years as we expand our drug discovery and development operations 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
we anticipate that collaborations will continue to be an important element of our future revenues 
we do not expect that government grant revenues  which were a significant source of our revenues through  to be significant in the coming years 
therefore  the loss of revenues from existing collaborations would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to grow revenues and become profitable is dependent  in part  on our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  and on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to successfully commercialize products incorporating  or based upon  our technologies and drug discovery and development programs 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or expand existing collaborations  or enter into future collaborations to apply our integrated genomic technologies on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  and  if entered into  we cannot guarantee that any such collaborative arrangements will be successful 
we have also established a majority owned subsidiary  corporation  to develop novel technologies for use in drug discovery and development 
we expect that will commercialize these products upon their development  which may be a future source of revenues for us 
our failure to successfully develop and market additional products over the next several years  or to realize existing product revenues  would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated for us from commercial sales of products developed through the application of our technologies are not expected for several years  if at all 
the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classification used in results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  as compared to  for the corresponding period in the increase for the twelve months ended december  was largely due to revenue recorded under our collaborative arrangements with abgenix  cor therapeutics  inc cor  genentech  inc genentech and glaxosmithkline  inc 
glaxo 
the revenue we recognize under our collaborative arrangements is generally based upon work performed on behalf of collaborators by our employees  or based upon our attainment of certain benchmarks specified in the related agreements 
further revenue growth will be dependent upon our ability to add additional collaborations  expand current collaborations and garner revenues from products currently under development by our collaborators 
grant revenue for the twelve months ended december  decreased compared to the same period in  due to the completion of our last two federal grants during the first and second quarters of as a result of the completion of such federal grants  we foresee no additional grant revenue in future periods  unless additional grant awards are received 
operating expenses 
collaborative research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in the increase of  or  was primarily attributable to internal research efforts and our obligations to fulfill research requirements under new and existing collaborations  which resulted in increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation and facilities expenses and additional personnel costs 
future collaborative research and development expenses are expected to increase as additional personnel are hired  research and development facilities are expanded to accommodate our internal research and collaborations and as the operations of are expanded  offset by a decrease in research and development expenses due to the completion of the research portion of various collaborative agreements 
grant research expenses for the twelve months ended december  were and represented a decrease compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in grant research expenses was attributable to the completion of our federal grants during the first and second quarters of as a result of the completion of such federal grants  we foresee no additional grant research expenses in future periods  unless additional grant awards are received 
during the fourth quarter of  we undertook an upgrade of scientific technologies and related lab equipment and signed an agreement with comdisco  inc comdisco for the acquisition of certain lab equipment with a fair market value of approximately  as a part of this transaction  we also purchased other lab equipment recorded as a capital lease for approximately  from transamerica business credit corporation tbcc 
the comdisco agreement calls for the exchange of the tbcc equipment for the comdisco equipment 
as a result of the exchange of the tbcc equipment for the comdisco equipment  we recognized an asset impairment expense of approximately  in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased  or  to  as compared to  for the same period in the increases were primarily attributable to higher recruiting  personnel  payroll and marketing costs  upgrades to our administration facilities and related increased rent expense  as well as legal expenses in support of the development of our intellectual property portfolios 
over the next several years  we anticipate that the percentage increases in general and administrative expenses will be similar to percentage increases in collaborative research and development expenses 
interest income  net 
net interest income for the year ended december  of  increased  or  compared to  for the increases were primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of funds we received from the completion of our convertible subordinated debt offering in february  the inclusion of cash raised in conjunction with the formation of our newly formed subsidiary in june and from the proceeds of our public offering in november  offset by the accrued interest expense associated with the completion of our convertible subordinated debt offering 
aside from the additional gross interest income which we expect to receive on the combined net proceeds from our private placements with abgenix in late and with bayer during the first quarter of  we anticipate that net interest income will begin to decrease as cash and cash equivalent balances are utilized in the normal course of operations 
gross interest expense for the year ended december  of  increased  or  compared to  for this increase in gross interest expense was primarily attributable to accrued interest and interest paid to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt which we issued on february  we would expect gross interest expense to remain relatively constant for income taxes 
for the year ended december   we have recorded a connecticut research and development income tax benefit of  we recorded this income tax benefit as a result of recent connecticut legislation which allows companies to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut at a rate of of their annual incremental research and development expense credit  in exchange for foregoing carryforward of their research and development credit 
during the year  we anticipate that the income tax benefit will continue to increase  as we incur additional qualifying collaborative research and development costs 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per share  as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per share in since inception  we have incurred operating losses  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of  we have not paid any federal income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances in amounts equal to the deferred income tax assets have been established to reflect these uncertainties in all periods presented 
minority interest 
minority interest of  is recorded for the portion of s losses attributable to stockholders of other than us 
as the expected future level of s losses increases  we anticipate recording additional minority interest based upon our ownership percentage 
years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for the year ended december  was  representing an increase of  or  compared to our revenue of  in this increase was largely due to an increase in collaboration revenue recorded under our arrangements with glaxo  hoffmann la roche inc  roche vitamins  inc  and cor

operating expenses 
grant research expenses for the year ended december  were  representing a decrease of  or  compared to  in the decrease in grant research expenses was attributable to the completion of our federal grants during the first and second quarters of collaborative research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  representing an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in such expenses was primarily attributable to our obligations to fulfill research requirements under new and existing collaborations  in addition to internal research efforts  which resulted in increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation and facilities expenses  and additional personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased  or  to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the net increase was primarily attributable to the reclassification of overhead expenses 
interest income  net

we have financed our operations since inception primarily through public offerings  our convertible subordinated debt offering  revenues received under our collaborative research and development arrangements  private placements of equity securities  government grants  and capital leases 
as of december   we had recognized  of cumulative sponsored research revenues from collaborative research agreements and government grants

our investing activities have consisted primarily of acquisitions of equipment and expenditures for leasehold improvements 
at december   our gross investment in equipment  computers and leasehold improvements since inception was  at december   equipment with a gross book value of  secures our equipment financing facility

recently enacted pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activitites  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  historically we have not entered into derivatives contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  we do not expect adoption of the new standard to affect our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides interpretations regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition where there is an absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry
