on october   jps elastomerics and c i the borrowing subsidiaries and jps entered into the credit facility agreement the credit agreement  as amended  by and among the financial institutions party thereto  citibank  as agent  and bank of america  as co agent 
as amended  on november   the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit loan facility and letters of credit the revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount equal to the lesser of a million and b a specified borrowing base the borrowing base  which is based upon eligible receivables  eligible inventory  and a specified dollar amount currently  subject to reduction based on fixed assets of the borrowing subsidiaries  except that i no borrowing subsidiary may borrow an amount greater than the borrowing base attributable to it less any reserves as specified in the credit agreement and ii letters of credit may not exceed million in the aggregate 
the credit agreement contains restrictions on investments  acquisitions and dividends unless  among other things  the company satisfies a specified pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio and maintains a specified minimum availability under the revolving credit facility for a stated period of time  and no default exists under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to minimum levels of ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and maximum capital expenditures 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is november  subsequent to october   the credit agreement has been amended to  among other things i modify the financial covenants relating to minimum levels of ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and maximum capital expenditures  ii modify the interest rate margin and unused commitment fees  iii provide additional reduction of the fixed asset portion of the borrowing base and iv allow the company to repurchase its common stock under certain circumstances

accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately million in fiscal principally due to timing differences 
the discontinued apparel business generated million of net cash provided by operations 
the principal non operating uses of cash in fiscal were for property  plant and equipment expenditures of million for upgrade of the company s manufacturing operations and the repayment of long term debt of approximately million 
the company also used million to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock

the lease provides for an early buyout option at the end of six years and includes purchase and renewal options at fair market value at the end of the lease term 
based upon the company s ability to generate working capital through its operations and its revolving credit facility  the company believes that it has the financial resources necessary to pay its capital obligations and implement its business plan for at least fiscal inflation and tax matters the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
it has generally been able to pass along inflationary increases in its costs by increasing the prices for its products or by increasing manufacturing efficiencies  however  market conditions sometimes preclude raising prices

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
the effective rates for all years are higher than the combined federal and state statutory rate due primarily to the impact of nondeductible excess reorganization costs 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company did not have any derivatives which were required to be recorded on the balance sheet 
on may   the company repriced certain stock options which  under financial accounting standards board interpretation number fin  requires them to be accounted for under variable plan accounting 
the application of fin  which was effective july   can result in the recognition of non cash compensation expense 
although there was no compensation expense in fiscal year as a result of applying fin  fin could result in significant future non cash compensation expense 
any expense will be added back to operating income to determine the company s ebitda  as previously defined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company has exposure to interest rate changes primarily relating to interest rate changes under its revolving credit facility 
the company s revolving credit facility bears interest at rates which vary with changes in i the london interbank offered rate libor or ii a rate of interest announced publicly by citibank in new york  new york 
the company does not speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
as of october   approximately million of the company s debt bore interest at variable rates 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows would not be significant 
raw material price risk 
a portion of the company s raw materials are commodities and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties  and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
in most cases  essential raw materials are available from several sources 
for several raw materials  however  branded goods or other circumstances may prevent such diversification and an interruption of the supply of these raw materials could have a significant impact on the company s ability to produce certain products 
the company has established long term relationships with key suppliers and may enter into purchase contracts or commitments of one year or less for certain raw materials 
such agreements generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the contract or commitment 
the company believes that any changes in raw material pricing  which cannot be adjusted for by changes in its product pricing or other strategies  would not be significant 
general economic conditions 
demand for the company s products is affected by a variety of economic factors including  but not limited to  the cyclical nature of the construction industry  demand for electronic and aerospace products which ultimately utilize components manufactured by the company  and general consumer demand 
adverse economic developments could affect the financial performance of the company
