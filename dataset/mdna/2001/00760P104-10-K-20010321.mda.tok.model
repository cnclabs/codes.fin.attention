item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the debt financing used to raise capital for the acquisition of the company s investments exposes the company to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
cash flows from the company s investments do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in addition  as of december   approximately of the company s total notes payable outstanding are either fixed rate or non interest bearing  and so the payments on these instruments do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the credit facility vary based on market interest rates  primarily the day euro contract rate 
thus  an increase in market interest rates would result in increased payments under the credit facility  without a corresponding increase in cash flows from the company s investments in the same amounts 
for example  based on the  outstanding under the credit facility at december   the company estimates that an increase of in the day euro contract rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately  a increase in the day euro contract rate would decrease annual net income by approximately  for the same reasons  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company  as a result of decreased payments under the credit facility without corresponding decreases in cash flows from the company s investments 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
on december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  at a fixed rate of 
this agreement expired on december  management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies
