overview the company is a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services in amounts generally ranging from to  with an average amount financed of approximately  the company primarily leases pos authorization systems and other small business equipment to small commercial enterprises 
for the years ended december  and  the company had fundings to dealers upon origination of leases  contracts and loans dealer fundings of million and million  respectively  and revenues of million and million  respectively 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from leases originated and held by the company  payments on service contracts  rental payments from lessees who continue to rent the equipment beyond the original lease term  and fee income 
the company funds the majority of leases  contracts and loans through its revolving credit and term loan facilities the credit facilities and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent  its subordinated debt program subordinated debt and internally generated funds 
in a typical lease transaction  the company originates leases through its network of independent dealers 
upon approval of a lease application by the company and verification that the lessee has both received the equipment and signed the lease  the company pays the dealer the cost of the equipment plus the dealer s profit margin 
in a typical transaction for the acquisition of service contracts  a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon credit approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  the company purchases from the dealer the right to the payment stream under that monitoring contract at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by the company are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  the company is scheduled to receive payments sufficient  in the aggregate  to cover the company s borrowing costs and the costs of the underlying equipment  and to provide the company with an appropriate profit 
the company enhances the profitability of its leases  contracts and loans by charging late fees  prepayment penalties  loss and damage waiver fees and other service fees  when applicable 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides the company with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment financed at the end of the initial term of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in the company s portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  substantially all service and rental contracts are month to month contracts with expected terms of seven years for service contracts  fifteen months for lessees that continue to rent their equipment beyond the original term  and twenty two months for other types of rental contracts 
certain accounting considerations the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in the opinion of management  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  the company may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interests is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
the company s investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the service period 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in service contracts 
rental equipment is recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of twelve months 
loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance 
interest income on loans is recognized as it is earned 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on its investment in leases  service contracts and loans at an amount that it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolio 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of the historical loss experience of the company and the level of recourse provided by such lease  service contract or loan  if any  and reflects management s judgment of additional loss potential considering current economic conditions and the nature and characteristics of the underlying lease portfolio 
the company determines the necessary periodic provision for credit losses taking into account actual and expected losses in the portfolio as a whole and the relationship of the allowance to the net investment in leases  service contracts and loans 
such provisions generally represent a percentage of funded amounts of leases  contracts and loans 
the resulting charge is included in the provision for credit losses 
leases  service contracts  and loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses and are put on non accrual when they are deemed to be uncollectable 
generally  the company deems leases  service contracts and loans to be uncollectable when one of the following occurs i the obligor files for bankruptcy  ii the obligor dies  and the equipment is returned  or iii when an account has become days delinquent 
the typical monthly payment under the company s leases is between and per month 
as a result of these small monthly payments  the company s experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current at days past due  a lessee will only owe lease payments of between and 
the company has developed and regularly updates proprietary credit scoring systems designed to improve its risk based pricing 
the company uses credit scoring in most  but not all  of its extensions of credit 
in addition  the company aggressively employs collection procedures and a legal process to resolve any credit problems

the increase in rental and service contract income is a result of the increased number of lessees that have continued to rent their equipment beyond their original lease term  a rental portfolio of  accounts purchased during the second quarter of  and the increased number of service contracts originated 
the increase in fee income is the result of increased fees from the lessees related to the collection and legal process employed by the company

since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities  its on balance sheet securitizations  and an initial public offering completed in february of the company has also funded its operations through the issuance of subordinated debt  however no new subordinated debt was issued in the company will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand its volume of leases  contracts and loans funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate sensitive instruments and risk management the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings  cash flows  and fair value of the financial instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company has used interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
the company used these instruments to reduce risk by creating offsetting market exposures 
the instruments held by the company are not held for trading purposes 
in the normal course of operations  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk  and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
interest rate risk management the implicit yield to the company on all of its leases  contracts and loans is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination of the lease 
when the company originates or acquires leases  contracts  and loans it bases its pricing in part on the spread it expects to achieve between the implicit yield rate to the company on each lease and the effective interest cost it will pay when it finances such leases  contracts and loans through its credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract or loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
the company has adopted a policy designed to protect itself against interest rate volatility during the term of each lease  contract or loan 
given the relatively short average life of the company s leases  contracts and loans  the company s goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
as of december   the company s outstanding fixed rate indebtedness outstanding under the company s securitizations and subordinated debt represented of the company s total outstanding indebtedness 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with one of its banks 
this arrangement expired in july the company s credit facility bears interest at rates  which fluctuate with changes in the prime rate or the day libor 
the majority of the company s long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
the company s interest expense on its credit facility and the fair value of its fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on the company s interest expense and the fair value of its fixed rate debt would be  and  respectively
