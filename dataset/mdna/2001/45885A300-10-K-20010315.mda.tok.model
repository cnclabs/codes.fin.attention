item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview internap is a leading provider of high performance internet connectivity services targeted at businesses seeking to maximize the performance of mission critical internet based applications 
customers connected to one of our service points have their data intelligently routed to and from destinations on the internet using our overlay network  which analyzes the traffic situation on the multiplicity of networks that comprise the internet and delivers mission critical information and communications faster and more reliably 
use of our overlay network results in lower instances of data loss and greater quality of service than services offered by conventional internet connectivity providers 
after we decide to open a new service point  we enter into a deployment phase which typically lasts four to six months  during which time we execute the required steps to make the service point commercially ready for service 
among other things  this usually entails obtaining collocation space to locate our equipment  entering into agreements with backbone providers  obtaining local loop connections from local telecommunications providers  building service points and initiating pre sales and marketing activities 
consequently  we usually incur a significant amount of upfront costs related to making a service point commercially ready for service prior to generating revenues 
therefore  our results of operations will be negatively affected during times of service point deployment 
as of december   we operate service points which are located in the amsterdam  atlanta  boston  chicago  dallas  denver  fremont  ca  houston  los angeles  miami  new york  orange county  philadelphia  san diego  san francisco  san jose  seattle and washington  dc metropolitan areas 
we expect to have over service points operational by the end of our customers are primarily businesses that desire high performance internet connectivity services in order to run mission critical internet based applications 
due to our high quality of service  we generally price our services at a premium to providers of conventional internet connectivity services 
we expect to remain a premium provider of high quality internet connectivity services and anticipate continuing our pricing policy in the future 
we believe customers will continue to demand the highest quality of service as their internet connectivity needs grow and become even more complex and  as such  will continue to pay a premium for high quality service 
our revenues are generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rate or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection and other ancillary services  such as collocation  content distribution  server management and installation services 
we also offer t and fractional ds connections only at fixed rates 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been provided  the fees for the service rendered are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
customers are billed on the first day of each month either on a usage or a flat rate basis 
the usage based billing relates to the month prior to the month in which the billing occurs  whereas certain flat rate billings relate to the month in which the billing occurs 
deferred revenues consist of revenues for services to be delivered in the future and consist primarily of advance billings for flat rate customers  which are amortized over the respective service period  and billings for initial installation of customer network equipment  which are amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
network and customer support costs are comprised of the costs for connecting to and accessing internet backbone providers and competitive local exchange providers  as well as costs related to deploying  operating  installing and maintaining service points and our network operations center 
to the extent a service point is located a distance from the respective internet backbone providers  we may incur additional local loop charges on a recurring basis 
additionally  rental fees and depreciation costs related to our service points and collocation facilities are included in cost of network and customer support 
product development costs consist principally of compensation and other personnel costs  consultant fees and prototype costs related to the design  development and testing of our proprietary technology  enhancement of our network management software and development of internal systems 
product development costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing costs consist of compensation  commissions and other costs for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as advertising  tradeshows  direct response programs  new service point launch events  management of our web site and other promotional costs 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of compensation and other expenses for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate costs 
on june   we completed our acquisition of co space 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under apb opinion no 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was approximately million and was comprised of the issuance of our common stock  cash  acquisition costs and assumed options to purchase common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock and assumed options to purchase co space common stock that were subsequently converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock to effect the acquisition 
results of operations of co space have been included in our financial results from the closing date of the transaction forward 
as a result of the co space acquisition  we recorded a total of million of intangible assets 
the intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their useful lives  which are estimated to be three years  resulting in expense of million for the year ended december  on july   we completed our acquisition of vpnx 
com 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under apb opinion no 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was approximately million and was comprised of issuance of our common stock  cash  acquisition costs and assumed options to purchase common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock and assumed options to purchase vpnx common stock that were subsequently converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock to effect the transaction 
results of operations of vpnx have been included in our financial results from the closing date of the acquisition forward 
as a result of the vpnx acquisition  we recorded a total of million of intangible assets 
the intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their useful lives  which are estimated to be three years  resulting in an expense of million for the year ended december  we also recorded an expense of million related to acquired in process research and development costs for the year ended december  the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development is related to technology acquired from vpnx that was expensed immediately subsequent to the closing of the acquisition since the technology had not completed the preliminary stages of development  had not commenced application development and did not have alternative future uses 
furthermore the technologies associated with the acquired in process research and development do not have a proven market and are sufficiently complex so that the probability of completion of a marketable service or product cannot be determined 
the fair value of the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which estimates the expected cash flows from projects once commercially viable and discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined based upon time and costs incurred on the project in addition to the relative complexity 
the percentages of completion varied by individual project and ranged from to 
the discount rate of used in the present value calculation was derived from an analysis of weighted average costs of capital  weighted average returns on assets and venture capital rates of returns adjusted for the specific risks associated with the in process research and development expense 
the development of the acquired technologies remains a significant risk as the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable services consists primarily of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet customer expectations 
during the years ended december  and  in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
in connection with our acquisition of vpnx  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million related to unvested options we assumed 
these amounts are included as a component of shareholders equity and are being amortized over the vesting period of the individual grants  generally four years  using an accelerated method as described in financial accounting standards board interpretations no 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation in the amount of million for the year ended december  at december   we had a total of million remaining to be amortized over the corresponding vesting periods of the stock options 
the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects 
we have only been in existence since  and our services are only offered in limited regions 
we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since our inception  and as of december   our accumulated deficit was million

revenues for the year ended december   increased by to million  up from million for the year ended december  net loss for the year ended december   was million  or per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the increase in internet connectivity revenues was attributable to the increased sales at our existing service points and the opening of additional service points during  resulting in a total of operational service points at december   as compared to service points at december  costs of network and customer support 
costs of network and customer support increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to increased connectivity costs related to added connections to internet backbone providers at each service point facility  comprising of the increase  and to a lesser extent  additional compensation costs  comprising of the increase  depreciation expense  comprising of the increase and facility rental expense  comprising of the increase 
network and customer support costs as a percentage of total revenues are generally greater than for newly deployed service points because we incur internet connectivity capacity  network equipment and collocation facility costs in advance of securing new customers 
we expect these costs to increase in absolute dollars as we deploy additional service points 
product development 
product development costs increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to increased compensation costs 
we expect product development costs to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to increased compensation costs related to the addition of sales and support personnel 
we expect sales and marketing costs to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to compensation costs  comprising of the increase  professional services costs  comprising of the increase  increased facility costs  comprising of the increase  recruiting costs  comprising of the increase  and travel costs  comprising of the increase 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars as we deploy additional service points 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income  interest and financing expense and other non operating expenses 
other income  net  increased from other income  net of million for the year ended december   to other income  net of million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to interest income earned on the proceeds from our private equity financings and our initial and follow on public offerings 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to increased internet connectivity revenues 
the increase in internet connectivity revenues was attributable to the increased sales at our existing service points and the opening of nine additional service points during  resulting in a total of operational service points at december   as compared to three service points at december  costs of network and customer support 
costs of network and customer support increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to increased connectivity costs related to added connections to internet backbone providers at each service point facility  comprising of the increase  and to a lesser extent  additional compensation costs  comprising of the increase  and depreciation expense related to the equipment at newly deployed service points  comprising of the increase 
network and customer support costs as a percentage of total revenues are generally greater than for newly deployed service points because we purchase internet connectivity capacity and network equipment and incur collocation facility costs in advance of securing new customers 
we expect these costs to increase in absolute dollars as we deploy additional service points 
product development 
product development costs increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to compensation costs  comprising of the increase  and outside consulting fees  comprising of the increase 
we expect product development costs to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future

we expect general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars as we deploy additional service points 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income  interest and financing expense and other non operating expenses 
other income  net  increased from an expense of  for the year ended december   to other income  net of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to interest income earned on the proceeds from our private equity financings and initial public offering 
provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses from inception through december  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize those assets in future periods 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of million 
these loss carry forwards are available to reduce future taxable income and expire at various dates beginning in under the provisions of the internal revenue code  certain substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of our equity securities  capital leases and bank loans 
as of december   we have raised an aggregate of approximately million  net of offering expenses  through the sale of our equity securities 
in january  we paid a stock dividend on our common stock and  accordingly  all related disclosures have been revised to reflect the stock dividend for all periods presented 
in october  we sold  shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price of per share resulting in net proceeds of million 
during october  in connection with our initial public offering  the underwriters exercised their overallotment option  resulting in the sale of an additional  shares of our common stock at per share for additional net proceeds of million 
upon the closing of our initial public offering  all shares of outstanding preferred stock converted into  shares of common stock 
concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering on october   we sold  shares of common stock to inktomi corporation for per share  resulting in proceeds of million 
in conjunction with this investment  we issued a warrant to inktomi to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant has a two year term and includes demand and piggyback registration rights 
on november   inktomi exercised of these warrants through a cashless exercise  resulting in the issuance of  shares of our common stock to inktomi 
the agreement also prohibits inktomi from acquiring additional shares of our common stock for a period of two years 
on february   pursuant to an investment agreement  we purchased  shares of aventail corporation series d preferred stock at per share for a total cash investment of million 
the series d preferred stock is convertible to common stock at a ratio of one share of preferred stock to one share of common stock  subject to adjustment for certain equity transactions 
additionally  we entered into a joint marketing agreement with aventail which  among other things  granted us limited exclusive rights to sell aventail s managed extranet service and granted aventail specified rights to sell our services 
in return  we committed to either sell aventail services or pay aventail  or a combination of both  which would result in aventail s receipt of million over a two year period 
on april    shares of our common stock were sold in a public offering at a price of per share 
of these shares   were sold by us and  shares were sold by selling shareholders 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling shareholders 
our proceeds from the offering were million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions of million 
pursuant to an investment agreement among us  ledcor limited partnership  worldwide fiber holdings ltd 
and networks  inc  on april   we purchased  shares of networks class a non voting stock at per share and  on april   we purchased  shares of networks class a subordinate voting stock at per share 
the total cash investment was million 
additionally  we entered into a letter of intent with networks to negotiate a strategic agreement that would provide us with long haul fiber optic bandwidth capacity and provide networks with our internet connectivity services 
on august   we entered into a credit facility with speedera networks  which allows speedera to borrow up to million from us 
the credit facility bears interest at the prime rate plus on the date of each draw and matures on may  as of december   we have included million in non current investments related to speedera borrowings under the credit facility 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and a revolving line of credit and equipment financing arrangements allowing us to borrow up to million  of which we had approximately million available to us under these facilities 
interest rates under these facilities range from to  and these facilities expire at various dates through these financial arrangements contain financial covenants including covenants to maintain certain liquidity ratios and minimum net worth 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  we are currently pursuing million to million in additional financing with leading financial institutions 
the majority of this financing is expected to be in the form of a credit facility 
as of the date of this report  the final terms  including the total facility amount  interest rate and covenants  are currently being negotiated 
we may be unable to successfully negotiate a definitive agreement on terms acceptable to us 
net cash used in operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operations for the years ended december   and  was primarily due to funding of net operating losses  in addition to increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  offset by non cash charges and increases in accounts payable except for the year ended december   in which accounts payable decreased  deferred revenue and accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in each period reflects increased purchases of property and equipment not financed by capital leases 
purchases of property and equipment related to service point deployments were primarily financed by capital leases such purchases are excluded from the net cash used in investing activities in the statement of cash flows  and totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  for the year ended december   million was used to purchase investments offset by proceeds of million from the disposition of certain investments  million was used in connection with restrictions of cash and million was used for acquisitions 
net cash provided from financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash from financing activities primarily reflects proceeds from sales of our equity securities and line of credit financing  offset by principal payments made on capital leases 
we expect to spend significant additional capital for marketing activities  to recruit and train our customer installation team and the sales force and to build out the sales facilities related to newly deployed service points 
in addition to service point deployment  although to a lesser extent  product development and the development of our internal systems and software will continue to require significant capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
we expect to continue to expend significant amounts of capital on property and equipment related to the expansion of facility infrastructure  computer equipment and for research and development laboratory and test equipment to support on going research and development operations 
during the next months  we expect to meet our cash requirements with existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flow from sales of our services 
however  our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services  the ability to expand our customer base  the rate of deployment of additional service points and other factors 
if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the sales of our services  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities 
we intend to invest cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities  the majority of which are commercial paper and government securities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
part of this portfolio includes our investment of million in a minority equity investment in networks  a publicly traded company listed on the nasdaq stock market 
the value of the networks investment is subject to market price volatility 
we also have a million equity investment in aventail  an early stage  privately held company  and a million credit facility due from speedera  an early stage  privately held company 
these strategic investments are inherently risky  in part because the market for the products or services being offered or developed by networks  aventail and speedera have not been proven and may never materialize 
because of risk associated with these investments  we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
the remaining portion of our investment portfolio  with a fair value of million as of december   is invested in commercial paper  government securities and corporate indebtedness that could experience an adverse decline in fair value should an increase in interest rates occur 
in addition  declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge against these interest rate exposures 
the following sensitivity analysis presents hypothetical changes in the fair values of our investment in networks  our only current public equity investment as of december  this modeling technique measures the hypothetical change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in the stock price of networks 
we selected stock price fluctuations of plus or minus  and because there has been at least one movement in the nasdaq composite index of at least in each of the last three years and movements of at least and in at least one of the last three years 
valuation of security given x increase in security s price in thousands valuation of security given x decrease in security s price in thousands fair value at in thousands security networks capital stock     as of december   all of our cash equivalents mature within three months and all of our short term investments mature within one year 
therefore  as of december   we believe the reported amounts of cash and cash equivalents  investments and capital lease obligations to be reasonable approximations of fair value and the market risk arising from our holdings of financial instruments is minimal 
all of our revenues are realized currently in us dollars and are from customers primarily in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
risk factors risks related to the company s business we have a history of losses and expect future losses and may not achieve or sustain annual profitability 
we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since we began operations 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
as a result of our expansion plans  we expect to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operations on a quarterly and annual basis for at least the next months  and we may never become profitable 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects 
the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects 
we have only been in existence since  and our services are only offered in limited regions 
investors should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by relatively new companies  particularly companies in the rapidly evolving internet infrastructure and connectivity markets 
our actual quarterly operating results may disappoint analysts expectations  which could have a negative impact on our stock price 
should our results of operations from quarter to quarter fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price could suffer 
any significant unanticipated shortfall of revenues or increase in expenses could negatively impact our expected quarterly results of operations should we be unable to make timely adjustments to compensate for them 
furthermore  a failure on our part to estimate accurately the timing or magnitude of particular anticipated revenues or expenses could also negatively impact our quarterly results of operations 
because our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future  investors should not rely on the results of any past quarter or quarters as an indication of future performance in our business operations or stock price 
for example  increases in our quarterly revenues for the quarters ended december   through december   have varied between and  and total operating costs and expenses  as a percentage of revenues  have fluctuated between and 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results depend on a number of factors 
some of these factors are industry risks over which we have no control  including the introduction of new services by our competitors  fluctuations in the demand and sales cycle for our services  fluctuations in the market for qualified sales and other personnel  changes in the prices for internet connectivity we pay backbone providers  our ability to obtain local loop connections to our service points at favorable prices  integration of people  operations  products and technologies of acquired businesses and general economic conditions 
other factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results arise from strategic decisions we have made or will make with respect to the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures such as those associated with the deployment of additional service points and the terms of our internet connectivity purchases 
for example  our practice is to purchase internet connectivity from backbone providers at new service points and license collocation space from providers before customers are secured 
we also have agreed to purchase internet connectivity from some providers without regard to the amount we resell to our customers 
some of our customers are emerging internet based businesses that may not pay us for our services on a timely basis and may not succeed over the long term 
a portion of our revenues are derived from customers that are emerging internet based businesses 
the unproven business models of some of these customers and an uncertain economic climate make their continued financial viability uncertain 
some of these customers have encountered financial difficulties and  as a result  have delayed or defaulted on their payments to us 
in the future others may also do so 
if these payment difficulties are substantial  our business and financial results could be seriously harmed 
we may require additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
the expansion and development of our business will require significant capital  which we may be unable to obtain  to fund our capital expenditures and operations  including working capital needs 
our principal capital expenditures and lease payments include the purchase  lease and installation of network equipment such as routers  telecommunications equipment and other computer equipment as well as data center leasehold improvements 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements may vary significantly depending on numerous factors  including regulatory  technological  competitive and other developments in our industry 
during the next months  we expect to meet our cash requirements with existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flow from sales of our services 
however  our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services  the ability to expand our customer base  the rate of deployment of additional service points and other factors 
if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the sales of our services  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities 
we may not be able to obtain future equity or debt financing on favorable terms  if at all 
future borrowing instruments  such as credit facilities and lease agreements  are likely to contain covenants restricting our ability to incur further indebtedness and will likely require us to pledge assets as security for borrowings thereunder 
the notes will be subordinated to all of our existing and any future senior indebtedness 
our inability to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms may delay or prevent the expansion of our business 
if we are unable to manage complications that arise during deployment of new service points  we may not succeed in our expansion plans 
any delay in the opening of new service points would significantly harm our plans to expand our business 
in our effort to deploy new service points  we face various risks associated with significant construction projects  including identifying and locating service point sites  construction delays  cost estimation errors or overruns  delays in connecting with local exchanges  equipment and material delays or shortages  the inability to obtain necessary permits on a timely basis  if at all  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control and all of which could delay the deployment of a new service point 
the deployment of new service points  each of which takes approximately four to six months to complete  is a key element of our business strategy 
in addition to our existing service points  we are planning to continue to deploy service points within limited geographic regions  including foreign countries 
although we conduct market research in a geographic area before deploying a service point  we do not enter into service contracts with customers prior to building a new service point 
we will incur additional expense associated with the deployment of new service points and may be unable to effectively integrate new service points into our existing network  which could disrupt our service 
new service points  if completed  will result in substantial new operating expenses  including expenses associated with hiring  training  retaining and managing new employees  provisioning capacity from backbone providers  purchasing new equipment  implementing new systems  leasing additional real estate and incurring additional depreciation expense 
in addition  if we do not institute adequate financial and managerial controls  reporting systems  and procedures with which to operate multiple service points in geographically dispersed locations  our operations will be significantly harmed 
if we are unable to continue to receive cost effective service from our backbone providers  we may not be able to provide our internet connectivity services on profitable terms  and these backbone providers may not continue to provide service to us 
in delivering our services  we rely on internet backbones  which are built and operated by others 
in order to be able to provide high performance routing to our customers through our service points  we must purchase connections from several internet backbone providers 
there can be no assurance that these internet backbone providers will continue to provide service to us on a cost effective basis  if at all  or that these providers will provide us with additional capacity to adequately meet customer demand 
furthermore  it is very unlikely that we could replace our internet backbone providers on comparable terms 
currently  in each of our fully operational domestic service points  we have connections to some combination of the following backbone providers at t  cable wireless usa  genuity  global crossing telecommunications  intermedia communications  psinet  qwest communications international  sprint internet services  uunet technologies and verio an ntt communications corporation 
we may be unable to maintain relationships with  or obtain necessary additional capacity from  these backbone providers 
furthermore  we may be unable to establish and maintain relationships with other backbone providers that may emerge or that are significant in geographic areas  such as asia and europe  in which we locate our service points 
competition from more established competitors who have greater revenues could decrease our market share 
the internet connectivity services market is extremely competitive  and there are few substantial barriers to entry 
we expect competition from existing competitors to intensify in the future  and we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise  sales and marketing abilities or support capabilities to compete successfully in our market 
many of our existing competitors have greater market presence  engineering and marketing capabilities  and financial  technological and personnel resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may have several advantages over us as we seek to develop a greater market presence 
our competitors currently include backbone providers that provide connectivity services to us  regional bell operating companies which offer internet access  and global  national and regional internet service providers 
in addition  internet backbone providers may make technological developments  such as improved router technology or the introduction of improved routing protocols  that will enhance the quality of their services 
as we continue to implement our international expansion  we will encounter additional competition from international internet service providers as well as international telecommunications companies in the countries where we provide services 
competition from new competitors could decrease our market share 
we also believe that new competitors will enter our market 
such new competitors could include computer hardware  software  media and other technology and telecommunications companies 
a number of telecommunications companies and online service providers have announced plans to offer or expand their network services 
for example  genuity  psinet and verio an ntt communications corporation have expanded their internet access products and services through acquisition 
further  the ability of some of these potential competitors to bundle other services and products with their network services could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
various companies are also exploring the possibility of providing  or are currently providing  high speed data services using alternative delivery methods including the cable television infrastructure  direct broadcast satellites  wireless cable and wireless local loop 
pricing pressure could decrease our market share 
increased price competition or other competitive pressures could erode our market share 
we currently charge  and expect to continue to charge  more for our internet connectivity services than our competitors 
for example  our current standard pricing is approximately more than uunet s current standard pricing and approximately more than sprint s current standard pricing 
by bundling their services and reducing the overall cost of their solutions  telecommunications companies that compete with us may be able to provide customers with reduced communications costs in connection with their internet connectivity services or private network services  thereby significantly increasing the pressure on us to decrease our prices 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any such price reductions even with an increase in the number of our customers  higher revenues from enhanced services  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  we believe that the internet connectivity industry is likely to encounter consolidation in the future 
consolidation could result in increased pressure on us to decrease our prices 
furthermore  the recent downturn in the us economy has resulted in many companies who require internet connectivity to reevaluate the cost of such services 
we believe that a prolonged economic downturn could result in existing and potential customers being unwilling to pay for premium internet connectivity services  which would harm our business 
a failure in our network operations center  service points or computer systems would cause a significant disruption in our internet connectivity services 
although we have taken precautions against systems failure  interruptions could result from natural disasters as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our network operations center  our service points and our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure 
if we experience a problem at our network operations center  we may be unable to provide internet connectivity services to our customers  provide customer service and support or monitor our network infrastructure or service points  any of which would seriously harm our business 
because we have limited experience operating internationally  our international expansion may be limited 
although we currently operate in domestic metropolitan markets  a key component of our strategy is to expand into international markets 
we have limited experience operating internationally 
we may not be able to adapt our services to international markets or market and sell these services to customers abroad 
in addition to general risks associated with international business expansion  we face the following specific risks in our international business expansion plans difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships with foreign backbone providers and local vendors  including collocation and local loop providers  difficulties in locating  building and deploying network operations centers and service points in foreign countries  and managing service points and network operations centers across disparate geographic areas  and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to address the risks associated with our currently proposed international operations  and our international sales growth may therefore be limited 
our brand is relatively new  and failure to develop brand recognition could hurt our ability to compete effectively 
to successfully execute our strategy  we must strengthen our brand awareness 
if we do not build our brand awareness  our ability to realize our strategic and financial objectives could be hurt 
many of our competitors have well established brands associated with the provision of internet connectivity services 
to date  we have attracted our existing customers primarily through a relatively small sales force and word of mouth 
in order to build our brand awareness  we intend to increase our marketing efforts significantly  which may not be successful  and we must continue to provide high quality services 
as part of our brand building efforts  we expect to increase our marketing budget substantially as well as our marketing activities  including advertising  tradeshows  direct response programs and new service point launch events 
we are dependent upon our key employees and may be unable to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team and key technical personnel 
the loss of any member of our executive management team or a key technical employee  such as our chief executive officer  anthony naughtin  our chief operating officer  michael vent  our chief financial officer  paul mcbride  or our chief technology officer  christopher wheeler  could significantly harm us 
any of our officers or employees can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
to the extent we are able to expand our operations and deploy additional service points  our workforce will be required to grow 
accordingly  our future success depends on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain a substantial number of highly skilled management  technical  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense 
consequently  we may not be successful in attracting  hiring  training and retaining the people we need  which would seriously impede our ability to implement our business strategy 
if we are not able to support our rapid growth effectively  our expansion plans may be frustrated or may fail 
our inability to manage growth effectively would seriously harm our plans to expand our internet connectivity services into new markets 
since the introduction of our internet connectivity services  we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion  which has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on all of our resources 
for example  as of december   we had one operational service point and nine employees compared to operational service points and full time employees as of december  in addition  we had million in revenues for the year ended december   compared to million in revenues for the year ended december  furthermore  we have recently begun to offer our services in europe 
we expect our growth to continue to strain our management  operational and financial resources 
for example  we may not be able to install adequate financial control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned information systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations 
the difficulties associated with installing and implementing new systems  procedures and controls may place a significant burden on our management and our internal resources 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we may lose rights to some of our most valuable assets 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our proprietary technology 
internap and p nap are trademarks of internap that are registered in the united states 
in addition  we have three patents that have been issued by the united states patent and trademark office  or uspto 
the dates of issuance for these patents range from september through december  and each of these patents is enforceable for a period of years after the date of its filing 
we cannot assure you that these patents or any future issued patents will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage to us or that the uspto will allow any additional or future claims 
we have eight additional applications pending  two of which are continuation in patent filings 
we may file additional applications in the future 
our patents and patent applications relate to our service point technologies and other technical aspects of our services 
in addition  we have filed corresponding international patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
it is possible that any patents that have been or may be issued to us could still be successfully challenged by third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents 
further  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technologies  duplicate our services and products or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
in addition  effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we intend to do business 
in addition to patent protection  we believe the protection of our copyrightable materials  trademarks and trade secrets is important to our future success 
we rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
in particular  we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and nondisclosure agreements with our customers and corporations with whom we have strategic relationships 
in addition  we generally register our important trademarks with the uspto to preserve their value and establish proof of our ownership and use of these trademarks 
any trademarks that may be issued to us may not provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage to us 
despite any precautions that we have taken  intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology 
we may face litigation and liability due to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
any claims that our services infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could significantly harm our operating results 
in addition  in our customer agreements  we agree to indemnify our customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringement of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
if a claim against us were to be successful  and we were not able to obtain a license to the relevant or a substitute technology on acceptable terms or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our ability to compete successfully in our competitive market would be impaired 
because we depend on third party suppliers for key components of our network infrastructure  failures of these suppliers to deliver their components as agreed could hinder our ability to provide our services on a competitive and timely basis 
any failure to obtain required products or services from third party suppliers on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost would affect our ability to provide our internet connectivity services on a competitive and timely basis 
we are dependent on other companies to supply various key components of our infrastructure  including the local loops between our service points and our internet backbone providers and between our service points and our customers networks 
in addition  the routers and switches used in our network infrastructure are currently supplied by a limited number of vendors  including cisco systems  inc additional sources of these services and products may not be available in the future on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we purchase these services and products pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
furthermore  we do not carry significant inventories of the products we purchase  and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our vendors 
we have in the past experienced delays in installation of services and receiving shipments of equipment purchased 
to date  these delays have neither been material nor have adversely affected us  but these delays could affect our ability to deploy service points in the future on a timely basis 
if cisco systems does not provide us with our routers  or if our limited source suppliers fail to provide products or services that comply with evolving internet and telecommunications standards or that interoperate with other products or services we use in our network infrastructure  we may be unable to meet our customer service commitments 
we have acquired and expect to acquire other businesses  and these acquisitions involve numerous risks 
we recently completed two significant business acquisitions 
in june and july  we acquired co space and vpnx  respectively  in merger transactions 
we expect to engage in additional acquisitions in the future in order to  among other things  enhance our existing services and enlarge our customer base 
acquisitions involve a number of risks that could potentially  but not exclusively  include the following difficulties in integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and services of the acquired companies in a timely and efficient manner  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations  insufficient revenues to offset significant unforeseen costs and increased expenses associated with the acquisitions  difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development being conducted by the acquired businesses  risks associated with our entrance into markets in which we have little or no prior experience and where competitors have a stronger market presence  deferral of purchasing decisions by current and potential customers as they evaluate the likelihood of success of the acquisitions  difficulties in pursuing relationships with potential strategic partners who may view the combined company as a more direct competitor than our predecessor entities taken independently  issuance by us of equity securities that would dilute ownership of existing shareholders  incurrence of significant debt  contingent liabilities and amortization expenses  and loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquiring high technology businesses as a means of achieving growth is inherently risky 
to meet these risks  we must maintain our ability to manage effectively any growth that results from using these means 
failure to manage effectively our growth through mergers and acquisitions could harm our business and operating results and could result in impairment of related long term assets 
risks related to our industry because the demand for our services depends on continued growth in use of the internet  a slowing of this growth could harm the development of the demand for our services 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet remain unresolved and may hinder the growth of internet use  especially in the business market we target 
despite growing interest in the varied commercial uses of the internet  many businesses have been deterred from purchasing internet connectivity services for a number of reasons  including inconsistent or unreliable quality of service  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed options  a limited number of local access points for corporate users  inability to integrate business applications on the internet  the need to deal with multiple and frequently incompatible vendors and a lack of tools to simplify internet access and use 
capacity constraints caused by growth in the use of the internet may  if left unresolved  impede further development of the internet to the extent that users experience delays  transmission errors and other difficulties 
further  the adoption of the internet for commerce and communications  particularly by those individuals and enterprises that have historically relied upon alternative means of commerce and communication  generally requires an understanding and acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
in particular  enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in other means of conducting commerce and exchanging information may be particularly reluctant or slow to adopt a new strategy that may make their existing personnel and infrastructure obsolete 
the failure of the market for business related internet solutions to further develop could cause our revenues to grow more slowly than anticipated and reduce the demand for our services 
because the internet connectivity market is new and our viability is uncertain  there is a risk our services may not be accepted 
we face the risk that the market for high performance internet connectivity services might fail to develop  or develop more slowly than expected  or that our services may not achieve widespread market acceptance 
this market has only recently begun to develop  is evolving rapidly and likely will be characterized by an increasing number of entrants 
there is significant uncertainty as to whether this market ultimately will prove to be viable or  if it becomes viable  that it will grow 
furthermore  we may be unable to market and sell our services successfully and cost effectively to a sufficiently large number of customers 
we typically charge more for our services than do our competitors  which may affect market acceptance of our services 
we believe the danger of nonacceptance is particularly acute during economic slowdowns 
finally  if the internet becomes subject to a form of central management  or if the internet backbone providers establish an economic settlement arrangement regarding the exchange of traffic between backbones  the problems of congestion  latency and data loss addressed by our internet connectivity services could be largely resolved  and our core business rendered obsolete 
if we are unable to respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological change  we may lose or fail to establish a competitive advantage in our market 
the internet connectivity industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  industry standards  customer needs and competition  as well as by frequent new product and service introductions 
we may be unable to successfully use or develop new technologies  adapt our network infrastructure to changing customer requirements and industry standards  introduce new services  such as virtual private networking and video conferencing  or enhance our existing services on a timely basis 
furthermore  new technologies or enhancements that we use or develop may not gain market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense  and we may be unable to successfully adapt our network and services to alternate access devices and technologies 
if our services do not continue to be compatible and interoperable with products and architectures offered by other industry members  our ability to compete could be impaired 
our ability to compete successfully is dependent  in part  upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our services with products and architectures offered by various other industry participants 
although we intend to support emerging standards in the market for internet connectivity  there can be no assurance that we will be able to conform to new standards in a timely fashion  if at all  or maintain a competitive position in the market 
new technologies could displace our services or render them obsolete 
new technologies and industry standards have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our services 
the adoption of such new technologies or industry standards could render our existing services obsolete and unmarketable 
for example  our services rely on the continued widespread commercial use of the set of protocols  services and applications for linking computers known as transmission control protocol internetwork protocol  or tcp ip 
alternative sets of protocols  services and applications for linking computers could emerge and become widely adopted 
a resulting reduction in the use of tcp ip could render our services obsolete and unmarketable 
our failure to anticipate the prevailing standard or the failure of a common standard to emerge could hurt our business 
further  we anticipate the introduction of other new technologies  such as telephone and facsimile capabilities  private networks  multimedia document distribution and transmission of audio and video feeds  requiring broadband access to the internet  but there can be no assurance that such technologies will create opportunities for us 
service interruptions caused by system failures could harm customer relations  expose us to liability and increase our capital costs 
interruptions in service to our customers could harm our customer relations  expose us to potential lawsuits and require us to spend more money adding redundant facilities 
our operations depend upon our ability to protect our customers data and equipment  our equipment and our network infrastructure  including our connections to our backbone providers  against damage from human error or acts of god 
even if we take precautions  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could result in interruptions in the services we provide to our customers 
capacity constraints could cause service interruptions and harm customer relations 
failure of the backbone providers and other internet infrastructure companies to continue to grow in an orderly manner could result in capacity constraints leading to service interruptions to our customers 
although the national telecommunications networks and internet infrastructures have historically developed in an orderly manner  there is no guarantee that this orderly growth will continue as more services  users and equipment connect to the networks 
failure by our telecommunications and internet service providers to provide us with the data communications capacity we require could cause service interruptions 
our network and software are vulnerable to security breaches and similar threats which could result in our liability for damages and harm our reputation 
despite the implementation of network security measures  the core of our network infrastructure is vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  network attacks and similar disruptive problems 
this could result in our liability for damages  and our reputation could suffer  thereby deterring potential customers from working with us 
security problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions and delays or to the cessation of service to our customers 
furthermore  inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and in those of our customers 
although we intend to continue to implement industry standard security measures  in the past some of these industry standard measures have occasionally been circumvented by third parties  although not in our system 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the measures we implement will not be circumvented 
the costs and resources required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems may result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service to our customers  which could hurt our business 
should the government modify or increase regulation of the internet  the provision of our services could become more costly 
there is currently only a small body of laws and regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  international  federal  state and local governments may adopt laws and regulations that affect the internet 
the nature of any new laws and regulations and the manner in which existing and new laws and regulations may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined 
the adoption of any future laws or regulations might decrease the growth of the internet  decrease demand for our services  impose taxes or other costly technical requirements or otherwise increase the cost of doing business on the internet or in some other manner have a significantly harmful effect on us or our customers 
the government may also seek to regulate some segments of our activities as it has with basic telecommunications services 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel  employment  personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business
