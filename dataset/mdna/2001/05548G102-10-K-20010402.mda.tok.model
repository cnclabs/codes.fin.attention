item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction bkf operates entirely through levco  an investment adviser registered with the us securities and exchange commission that was acquired by bkf in june levco specializes in managing equity portfolios for institutional and individual investors primarily in the united states 
most accounts are managed pursuant to a large cap value strategy  levco also offers an event driven product as well as other more specialized investment programs 
levco acts as the general partner of a number of investment partnerships and also acts as an adviser to private investment vehicles organized outside the united states 
with respect to accounts managed pursuant to its large cap value strategy  levco generally receives advisory fees based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management  including market appreciation or depreciation and client contributions and withdrawals 
with respect to private investment vehicles and separate accounts managed pursuant to similar strategies  levco is generally entitled to receive both a fixed management fee based on a percentage of the assets under management and a share of net profits 
levco obtains some of its clients for its large cap value product through wrap fee programs sponsored by major financial services companies 
in these programs  clients pay the sponsoring broker an asset based fee that covers brokerage commissions  advisory services  custodial fees  and other reporting and administrative services 
investors are able to select levco from among a limited number of managers participating in the program  and levco receives a portion of the wrap fee paid by the clients who select levco to manage their accounts through the program 
at december   assets under management at levco were billion  up from billion a year earlier 
following is a comparison of levco assets under management in millions as defined by product and client type december  december  december  institutional    bkf a non institutional    event driven  private investment funds wrap   total    a the bkf portfolio managed by levco was liquidated during the period between august  and december  levco also has a wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary that clears trades through csc on a fully disclosed basis 
generally  the customers of the broker dealer subsidiary are advisory clients of levco  and the trades executed through the broker dealer are generally placed by levco in its capacity as investment adviser 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations is based on the consolidated statements of financial condition at december  and pro forma and the pro forma consolidated statements of income for each of the three years in the period ended december  of bkf capital group  inc and subsidiaries which are included elsewhere herein and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements 
in light of the evolution of bkf from a closed end management investment company to a holding company whose primary asset is the investment management business of levco  pro forma financial statements have been included in this annual report on form k in order to provide meaningful comparisons of financial information for the years ended december   and we have not included a discussion of historical financial results of bkf as a closed end management investment company because it completed the distribution of substantially all of its assets on january  pursuant to a plan of distribution of assets approved by stockholders on august  and ceased to be registered as an investment company on april  particular attention should be paid to the fact that a change in accounting principle was effected on april  resulting in an amortization expense that has been reflected in the pro forma financial statements 
this amortization expense has been reflected on a pro forma basis in the financial statements for and  and the financial statements for reflect the actual cumulative amortization charge absorbed by bkf in as the result of the change in accounting principle 
certain statements under this caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see item business special note regarding forward looking statements 
pro forma results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for rose to million  reflecting an increase of from million in revenues in this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in investment advisory fees excluding incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from million excluding investment advisory fees received for managing the portfolio of bkf to million and a increase in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from million to million 
the increase in investment advisory fees is primarily attributable to the increase in assets under management in the large cap value strategy  which experienced a significant increase in assets managed in wrap fee programs  and the event driven product 
the increase in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations is primarily attributable to the increase in assets under management in the event driven product and approximately million in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from accounts or vehicles following the large cap value strategy or specialized investment strategies other than the event driven product which had not produced incentive fees or allocations in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations are accrued on a quarterly basis but are primarily determined and billed at the end of the applicable contract year or upon withdrawal 
net commission income generated by the broker dealer business rose from million to million 
agreements relating to several of the private investment funds managed by levco have been amended to allow for direct participation by employee controlled entities in the fees and allocations generated by such funds 
these changes will lead to a decrease in reported revenues  and a corresponding dollar for dollar decrease in reported compensation expense  in expenses total expenses for rose from million to million 
excluding amortization of intangibles  total expenses rose from million to million 
the largest component of this increase was a increase in compensation expense  which went from million to million 
this increase in compensation expense is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues as cash compensation expense is based on a percentage of pre tax  pre compensation profits and grants of restricted stock units to employees of the firm 
bkf anticipates that cash compensation expense as a percentage of pre tax  pre compensation profits will further increase in under the compensation guidelines approved by the board of directors 
in connection with compensation and as part of a broader incentive compensation program meant to retain and attract key employees  the compensation committee of bkf s board of directors approved grants of  restricted stock units to bkf employees 
these grants vested immediately and resulted in compensation expense of million in under the terms of the stock award agreements relating to the grants  the actual delivery of shares of stock will not take place for three years and will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions by the recipients 
because the grants utilized a significant portion of the equity available under the bkf incentive compensation plan  which allows for the issuance of up to  shares  bkf anticipates that stockholders will be requested to approve an amendment to the plan to allow for the issuance of an additional  shares under the plan  of which only  may be taken from the authorized and unissued shares of bkf 
other operating expenses of bkf rose from million to million  primarily reflecting an increase in marketing fees paid to third parties for soliciting investors on behalf of levco 
other factors contributing to the rise were increased promotional expenses relating to internal marketing efforts and an increase in portfolio management and trading system costs 
bkf expects to enter into a lease amendment providing it with an additional  square feet in its current location  commencing july  this lease amendment will result in an additional annual expense of approximately million  part of which may be offset through the subleasing of unused space 
operating income operating income decreased to  from million  reflecting the increase in expenses  including the restricted stock unit grants  which exceeded the increase in revenues 
excluding the amortization of intangibles and the grant of restricted stock units  operating income rose  from million to million 
interest income interest income increased by  from  to million 
this increase in interest income resulted from four major factors increased cash generated by operations  the shift of a portion of compensation from cash to equity based instruments  a reduction in estimated tax payments resulting from the utilization of a portion of a capital loss  and the reclassification of the million bkf loan to levco to equity in december this reclassification enabled levco to cease making interest payments to bkf  resulting in higher cash balances for levco 
loss on investments in  bkf had a net realized and unrealized loss on investments of  primarily as the result of the permanent write down of a historical private placement position that had been part of bkf s portfolio when it was an investment company 
this loss was partly offset by net gains in small cap  small mid cap  and financial services long only equity value portfolios funded by bkf in the fourth quarter of in order to establish track records for developing products 
a pro forma adjustment to the financial statements eliminating investment company specific income resulted in there being no pro forma net loss or gain on investments in income taxes bkf recorded an income tax benefit of  in  as compared to a tax provision of million in in  bkf realized a million capital loss relating to an investment that was made when bkf was still an investment company  million of this loss was used in to offset taxable capital gains 
the balance of the unused capital loss will be carried back to previous taxable years to offset prior taxable capital gains 
such carry back will result in a tax refund 
absent the non deductible amortization expense and the realization of the capital loss previously recorded as an unrealized loss by the investment company  bkf would have an effective tax rate of 
for the period ended december   application of a effective tax rate results in a provision for taxes of million 
this amount was offset by million in future tax benefits primarily attributable to million in future tax benefits from the unused portion of the capital loss  million in future tax benefits relating to future compensation deductions attributable to the grant of restricted stock units as the compensation expense is not deductible for tax purposes until the delivery of the underlying stock and million in future taxable income attributable to deferred revenue and unrealized gain on investments 
an effective tax rate of before amortization was used to calculate the provision for taxes at december  change in accounting principle a change in accounting principle that became effective on april  upon the de registration of bkf as an investment company resulted in a cumulative amortization expense deriving from the acquisition of levco by bkf 
the de registration of bkf transformed bkf into an operating company and caused the transaction to become subject to purchase accounting rules 
this amortization expense is non deductible for income tax purposes because the purchase accounting method is being applied retroactively 
a one time charge to income in the amount of million for accumulated amortization from june through april  was recorded in the second quarter of this was a non cash charge 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenues revenues increased from to  to million from million 
this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations from million to million 
this increase in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations was primarily the result of the increase in assets under management in the event driven product 
incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations are accrued on a quarterly basis but are primarily determined and billed at the end of the applicable contract year or upon withdrawal 
investment advisory fees rose from to  from million to million  primarily as the result of the growth in assets under management in wrap fee programs  as the management fees from assets gathered through these distribution channels rose to million from million 
net commission income generated by the broker dealer business rose from million to million 
expenses total expenses increased to million in from million in  or 
excluding amortization of intangibles  total expenses rose from million to million 
compensation expenses rose in  to million from million 
a major contributor to the rise in the expenses was the increase in the number of employees from to during in  a full year of expenses relating to these employees were incurred for the first time 
in  the number of employees increased from to in  bkf s board of directors established a target percentage for the amount of profits before taxes  compensation and amortization expenses that should be allocated to compensation 
this target percentage was established with the goal of creating a structure that would allow levco to retain key professionals and took into account the compensation structure at other investment management businesses 
the target percentage for was higher than the percentage actually paid in under the bkf incentive compensation plan  certain professionals elected to shift a portion of their cash compensation into grants of restricted stock units rsus and non qualified options 
this shift had the effect of reducing compensation expense for those employees electing to receive equity in lieu of cash forfeited their rights to the cash equivalent portion of their bonus million in return for the rsus and non qualified options received 
in return  these employees received an additional of equity based on the amount exchanged 
the rsus and options require future services as a condition to the ultimate receipt of the underlying number of shares of bkf stock 
bkf s policy is to record the rsu expense ratably over the required service period 
other operating expenses rose to million from million 
the largest factors in this rise in other operating expenses were levco s share of professional fees relating to the implementation of the bkf incentive compensation plan and the increase in expenses relating to the institutional marketing effort 
other factors relating to the rise in non compensation expenses were the increase in the depreciation expense relating to the office space taken on the th floor at one rockefeller plaza  which expense was calculated for only one quarter of  and the costs associated with the implementation of a new portfolio management and trading system for accounts managed through wrap fee programs 
operating income operating income increased to million in from a loss of  in excluding amortization of intangibles  operating income rose from million in to million in  reflecting the increase in revenues  which exceeded the increase in expenses 
interest income interest income increased by  from  to  this increase in interest income resulted primarily from increased cash generated by operations 
income taxes bkf recorded an income tax expense of million in  an increase of over the income tax expense of million 
this increase primarily reflects an increase in income before taxes as determined without a deduction for the amortization of intangibles 
an effective tax rate of before amortization was used to make the determination with respect to the income tax expense at december   while an effective tax rate of before amortization was used to calculate the provision for taxes at december  the differential in tax rates is primarily due to state allocations 
liquidity and capital resources bkf s current assets as of december  consist primarily of cash  short term investments  advisory fees receivable and marketable equity securities 
bkf s business is not capital intensive 
bkf has historically met its cash and liquidity needs through cash generated by operating activities 
at december   bkf had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  this increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflects the retention of operating income 
the increase in investment advisory fees receivable to million at december  from million at december  primarily reflects the increase in incentive fees earned as well as the increase in investment management fees resulting from the increase in assets under management 
the increase in investments in affiliated investment partnerships to million at december  from million at december  primarily reflects the increase in incentive allocations to levco gp 
it is levco s general practice to withdraw the incentive allocations earned within three months after the fiscal year 
the decrease in other assets to  at december  from  at december  is primarily attributable to the return of a portion  of the security deposit under the terms of levco s lease agreement 
the increase in current and non current deferred tax assets to million in from  in is primarily attributable to the realization of a million dollar capital loss relating to an investment made when bkf was still an investment company  of which only million was used to offset capital gains in  and a million compensation expense deduction that may be taken at such time as the shares underlying the restricted stock units that have been granted are actually delivered 
prepaid expenses and other current assets rose to million at december  from million at december  as the result of the purchase of a new  three year directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance policy 
the premium for the policy is being financed by bkf over a month period  resulting in an insurance payable of  at december  investments in securities of million represent investments made by the company in the fourth quarter of to seed small cap  small mid cap and financial services long only equity value products 
accrued expenses were million at december   as compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the completion of the wind down of the chicago based operations of bkf 
accrued bonuses were at million at december   as compared to million at december  this increase is attributable to the increase in revenues over this same period 
based upon bkf s current level of operations and anticipated growth  bkf expects that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to finance its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
bkf has no material commitments for capital expenditures  and bkf s business is not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because bkf s revenues are largely driven by the market value of levco s assets under management  these revenues are exposed to fluctuations in the equity markets 
management fees for most accounts are determined based on the market value of the account on the last day of the quarter with respect to which the investment advisory fee is charged  so any significant increases or decreases in market value occurring on or shortly before the last day of a quarter may materially impact revenues for the quarter 
furthermore  because levco manages most of its assets in a large cap value style  a general decline in the performance of value stocks could have an adverse impact on levco s revenues 
similarly  a lack of opportunity to implement  or a failure to successfully implement  levco s event driven  risk arbitrage strategy  could reduce performance based incentive fees and allocations and thereby negatively impact bkf s revenues
