operating income declined in due to the revenue decline and increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points in versus prior year 
the gross margin increase in reflects a percentage point increase in product gross margin and a percentage point increase in services gross margin 
product gross margin in reflects a favorable sales mix  which includes increased sales within our higher margin solutions  such as data warehousing  and decreased sales of lower margin products within our exited solutions 
the improvement in services gross margin was driven by strong margin improvements in our professional consulting services  and increased margins for transactional support services within our key solutions 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points in compared to the gross margin increase in consisted of a percentage point increase in product gross margin and a percentage point increase in services gross margin 
gross margin improvements in reflect a favorable sales mix and improved professional consulting margin 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in compared to a decrease of million or in the decrease in was primarily due to lower selling expenses and employee reductions related to the restructuring plan  offset partially by increases in marketing expense and amortization of goodwill from acquisitions

in december of  our board of directors approved a systematic share repurchase program to offset the dilutive effects of the employee stock purchase plan and outstanding options 
combined with share repurchase programs approved in april and october  we used million of cash to repurchase shares during  and million to repurchase shares during in  we entered into a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks and financial institutions 
the credit facility provides that we may borrow  from time to time  on a revolving credit basis an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
we expect to be able to use the available funds at any time for capital expenditure needs  repayment of existing debt obligations  working capital and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility matures in and contains certain representations and warranties  conditions  affirmative  negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for such a facility 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility are based on market rates 
in addition  a portion of the credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit as we require 
no amounts were outstanding under the facility as of december   or we believe that cash flows from operations  the credit facility existing or future arrangements and other short and long term debt financings  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
restructuring during the fourth quarter of  we established a restructuring plan designed to accelerate our transformation from a computer hardware and product company to a technology solutions and services provider 
the plan contemplated an alignment around three key solutions data warehousing  financial self service and retail store automation  the elimination of approximately  associate positions  the exit of certain commodity hardware businesses and an enhanced leverage of the investment in our data warehousing offering 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of the charge included a million accrual under postemployment benefit plans related to employee separations  million of charges related to asset impairments  million of charges for the write off of software licenses and inventory write downs and million of charges for other items 
cash payments under the plan totaled million  and we anticipate that future cash payments under the plan will not be significant 
in addition  we expected to incur approximately million of period costs during  primarily related to settling customer obligations that were not complete as of december  these obligations were resolved for approximately million  or million less than originally expected 
we recorded the costs associated with these obligations through charges of million in cost of revenue and million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed at december  as a result of the restructuring  we achieved an estimated savings of more than million in due primarily to the elimination of losses in the exited solutions  as well as through cost savings related to employee separations within our support organizations 
in addition  we experienced a revenue decline of approximately million as a result of our decision to exit specific non key solutions in certain geographic areas 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k and other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission  as well as other oral or written statements we may make from time to time  contain information based on management s beliefs and include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  and there are a number of factors  including those listed below  which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
competition our ability to compete effectively within the technology industry is critical to our future success 
we compete in the intensely competitive information technology industry 
this industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  price and cost reductions  and increasingly greater commoditization of products  making differentiation difficult 
in addition  this intense competition increases pressure on gross margins that could impact our business and operating results 
our competitors include other large  successful companies in the technology industry such as diebold  inc  international business machines ibm  oracle corporation  unisys corporation and wincor nixdorf gmbh co  some of which have widespread penetration of their platforms 
if we are unable to compete successfully  the demand for our solutions  including products and services  would decrease 
any reduction in demand could lead to fewer customer orders  a decrease in the prices of our products and services  reduced revenues  reduced margins  operating inefficiencies  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
these competitive pressures could impact our business and operating results 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to rapidly and continually design  develop and market  or otherwise obtain and introduce solutions and related products and services for our customers that are competitive in the marketplace  offer a wide range of solutions from web enabled kiosks to enterprise data warehouses  offer solutions to customers that operate effectively within a computing environment  which include the integration of hardware and software from multiple vendors  offer products that are reliable and that ensure the security of data and information  offer high quality  high availability services  market and sell all of our solutions effectively and produce and deliver solutions at competitive operating margins 
introduction of new solutions the solutions we sell are very complex  and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions 
we operate in a very competitive  rapidly changing environment  and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new solutions that our customers choose to buy 
if we are unable to develop new solutions  our business and operating results would be impacted 
this includes our efforts to rapidly develop and introduce data warehousing software applications 
the development process for our complex solutions  including our software application development programs  requires high levels of innovation from both our developers and our suppliers of the components embedded in our solutions 
in addition  the development process can be lengthy and costly 
it requires us to commit a significant amount of resources to bring our business solutions to market 
if we are unable to anticipate our customers needs and technological trends accurately  or are otherwise unable to complete development efficiently  we would be unable to introduce new solutions into the market on a timely basis  if at all  and our business and operating results would be impacted 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions  such as our self checkout and electronic shelf label solutions  our operating results would be impacted 
our solutions  which contain both hardware and software products  may contain known as well as undetected errors which may be found after the products introduction and shipment 
while we attempt to fix errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment  we may not be able to detect or fix all such errors  and this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance and incremental costs  which would all impact our operating results 
reliance on third parties third party suppliers provide important elements to our solutions 
we rely on many suppliers for necessary parts and components to complete our solutions 
in most cases  there are a number of vendors producing the parts and components that we utilize 
however  there are some components that are purchased from single sources due to price  quality  technology or other reasons 
for example  we depend on chips and microprocessors from intel corporation and operating systems from unix r and microsoft windows nt r 
certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our atms and the delivery of some of our store automation solutions are also supplied by single sources 
if we were unable to purchase the necessary parts and components from a particular vendor and we had to find an alternative supplier for such parts and components  our new and existing product shipments and solutions deliveries could be delayed  impacting our business and operating results 
we have  from time to time  formed alliances with third parties such as the outsourcing arrangements with solectron corporation to manufacture hardware that have complementary products  services and skills 
these alliances introduce risks that we cannot control such as non performance by third parties and difficulties with or delays in integrating elements provided by third parties into our solutions 
the failure of third parties to provide high quality products or services that conform to the required specifications could impair the delivery of our solutions on a timely basis and impact our business and operating results 
acquisitions and alliances our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or effectively manage alliance activities will help drive future growth 
as part of our overall solutions strategy  we intend to continue to make investments in companies  products  services and technologies  either through acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic alliances 
acquisitions and alliance activities inherently involve risks 
the risks we may encounter include those associated with assimilating and integrating different business operations  corporate cultures  personnel  infrastructures and technologies or products acquired or licensed  retaining key employees and the potential for unknown liabilities within the acquired or combined business 
the investment or alliance may also disrupt our ongoing business  or we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired products  services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality 
business acquisitions typically result in intangible assets being recorded and amortized in future years 
future operating results could be impacted if our acquisitions do not generate profitable results in excess of the related amortization expense 
operating result fluctuations we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate for a number of reasons 
future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations based on a variety of factors  including seasonality 
our sales are historically seasonal  with revenue higher in the fourth quarter of each year 
during the three quarters ending in march  june and september  we have historically experienced less favorable results than in the quarter ending in december 
such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume  timing and mix of product sales 
in addition  revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months 
these factors  among other things  make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately 
acquisitions and alliances 
as part of our solutions strategy  we intend to continue to acquire technologies  products and businesses as well as form strategic alliances and joint ventures 
as these activities take place and we begin to include the financial results related to these investments  our operating results will fluctuate 
for example  the acquisition of front will result in incremental customer services revenue  margin and operating expenses 
multi national operations continuing to generate substantial revenues from our multi national operations helps to balance our risks and meet our strategic goals 
currently  approximately of our revenues come from our international operations 
we believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations eg  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties 
however  our ability to sell our solutions domestically in the united states and internationally is subject to the following risks  among others general economic and political conditions in each country which could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets  as evidenced by the recent economic slowing in the us retail industry  currency exchange rate fluctuations which could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses  currency changes such as the euro introduction which could affect cross border competition and pricing and require modifications to our offerings to accommodate the changeover  and changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets 
employees hiring and retaining highly qualified employees helps us to achieve our business objectives 
our employees are vital to our success  and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  sales  consulting and other key personnel is critical as these key employees are difficult to replace 
the expansion of high technology companies has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel 
if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future  our business and operating results could be impacted 
intellectual property as a technology company  our intellectual property portfolio is key to our future success 
our intellectual property portfolio is a key component of our ability to be a leading technology and services solutions provider 
to that end  we aggressively protect and work to enhance our proprietary rights in our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and if our efforts fail  our business could be impacted 
in addition  many of our offerings rely on technologies developed by others  and if we were not able to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies  our business would be impacted 
moreover  from time to time  we receive notices from third parties regarding patent and other intellectual property claims 
whether such claims are with or without merit  they may require significant resources to defend and  if an infringement claim is successful  in the event we are unable to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business could be adversely affected 
environmental our historical and ongoing manufacturing activities subject us to environmental exposures 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the fox river matter as further described in environmental matters under note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report and we incorporate such discussion in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations by reference and make it a part of this risk factor 
contingencies like other technology companies  we face uncertainties with regard to regulations  lawsuits and other related matters 
we are subject to regulations  proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  including those that relate to the environment  health and safety  and intellectual property 
such matters are subject to the resolution of many uncertainties  thus  outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
while we believe that amounts provided in our financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities  there can be no assurances that the amounts required to discharge alleged liabilities from lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings and environmental matters  and to comply with applicable environmental laws will not impact future operating results

in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas and the corresponding amendments under sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we have elected to adopt sfas and sfas effective january  sfas and sfas require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
for fair value hedge transactions in which we are hedging changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be offset in the income statement by changes in the hedged item s fair value 
for cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable rate asset  liability or a forecasted transaction  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be reported in other comprehensive income 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
in the event that a hedging instrument is deemed to be ineffective under sfas  the ineffective portion will be recognized in current period earnings 
on january   we will record net of tax  cumulative effect type losses of million and million  in accumulated other comprehensive income and net income  respectively  to recognize at fair value all derivative instruments that will be designated as hedging instruments 
included in the million loss is an immaterial expense related to derivatives that are deferred on the balance sheet and will be de designated as effective hedges

sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenues in financial statements 
consistent with the requirements to implement sab no later than the fourth quarter for fiscal years beginning after december   we adopted the provisions of sab and the resulting impact was immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows

sfas  which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral 
the standard is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  we do not expect adoption of this standard to have any impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we use a variety of measures to monitor and manage these risks  including derivative financial instruments 
since a substantial portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts and options 
these instruments generally mature within months 
at inception  select derivative instruments are designated as hedges of inventory purchases and sales  and of certain financing transactions that are firmly committed or forecasted 
generally  gains and losses on qualifying hedged transactions are deferred and recognized in the determination of income when the underlying transactions are realized  canceled or otherwise terminated 
when hedging certain foreign currency transactions of a long term investment nature  gains and losses are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses on other foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income or expense as exchange rates change 
for purposes of potential risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio related to anticipated transactions 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction 
as of december  and  a appreciation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase or a million dollar decrease in the fair value of the hedge portfolio  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase or a million increase in the fair value of the hedge portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at december  was not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments  short term investments and cash and cash equivalents 
credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
the maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals  credit limits  selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures 
our business often involves large transactions with customers  and if one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements  we could be exposed to potential significant losses 
however  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate 
at december  and  we did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments 
item b recent developments in march  we announced concerns about the ability of credit card center ccc  a leading distributor of atm equipment into the us small retailer marketplace  to repay an outstanding loan and receivable to ncr 
we have worked with ccc to develop stronger customer leasing support  but ccc s revenue growth has outpaced its capital and management resources  resulting in cash flow deficiencies that could impact its ability to repay its obligations to ncr 
although we will continue to work closely with ccc to successfully resolve these issues  we anticipate that we will establish a reserve related to prior business with ccc of approximately million before tax or million after tax
