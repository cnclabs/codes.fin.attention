item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations the company s total revenues increased from million in to million in the growth was attributable to a increase in revenues from the company s prepaid wireless services business  and partially offset by a decline in roaming services revenues and a decline in systems revenues 
in  total revenues increased compared to primarily due to a increase in prepaid wireless services revenues  partially offset by a decline in roaming service revenues and a decline in systems revenues 
the company increased its operating income from continuing operations from operating losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  to operating income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  the significant increase in prepaid wireless services revenues principally contributed to the improvement in operating income from continuing operations in and excluding the effects of the loss on impairment of long lived assets and one time charges in the three years ended december   and  the operating losses from continuing operations for the years ended december  and were million and  respectively  and operating income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million 
the specifics of each segment s revenues and gross margin are discussed in greater detail below 
the company s reportable operating segments consist of prepaid wireless services  roaming services and systems businesses 
the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note of the company s consolidated financial statements  except that the financial results for the company s operating segments have been prepared using a management approach 
this approach is consistent with the basis and manner in which the company s management internally analyzes financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
the company evaluates performance based on the gross margin of each stand alone business 
in  for segment reporting purposes  the company began reporting inter segment sales from the systems business to the prepaid services business for voice nodes  known as v nodes  and related equipment shipped during the year 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to permit comparison 
segment disclosure information is included in note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s chief operating decision maker is its president and chief executive officer 
the company s operating segments are managed separately because each represents a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves unique markets within the wireless industry 
however  the businesses complement each other providing the company with a strong suite of products and services to meet the needs of wireless carriers

prepaid wireless services prepaid wireless services revenues increased from million in to million in and increased to million in at the end of  there were approximately million paid subscribers on the company s ivsn compared to million subscribers at the end of  an increase of approximately 
the subscribers increased over in from  at the end of the increases in revenues were primarily due to increased numbers of subscribers and greater minutes of use  partially offset by a decrease in the average price per minute as carriers availed themselves of the company s volume discounts 
the company expects the average price per minute to continue to decline as carriers grow their subscriber bases and continue to utilize the company s volume discounts 
gross margins for the prepaid wireless services improved from of prepaid wireless service revenues in to of revenues in and to of revenues in the company s gross margin increased during each quarter of excluding the one time charge  even with the carrier s additional volume discounts 
with the loss of rogers at t in the first quarter of  the company expects gross margin levels to decrease in at least the first few quarters of the gross margin for includes a one time charge for a million accrual for legal expenses 
the charge for legal expenses represents the fees the company may incur in the defense of a patent infringement suit brought by freedom wireless 
the company believes that the claims made by freedom wireless are without merit and will vigorously defend the action 
the improvement in both years resulted from the significant increase in prepaid wireless services revenues in and that leveraged the predominantly fixed cost infrastructure 
this increase in gross margins was partially offset by increased personnel and related costs incurred to support the growth of the ivsn and transaction processing platform 
the company previously announced that rogers at t will not renew its prepaid contract and that it would bring its prepaid program in house 
in the first quarter of  the company expects approximately  subscribers to migrate off of the bcgi platform 
while management believes that the loss of subscribers due to rogers at t s departure from the bcgi platform will be offset by increased net subscriber additions  among bcgi s existing carrier customers later in and the addition of new carriers to its platform  management revised its financial projections downward for first quarter and full year fiscal roaming services roaming services revenues decreased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the decrease in roaming services revenues was primarily attributable to consolidation in the industry and an increase in one rate registered roaming plans offered by some national carriers 
the company anticipates that these trends will continue and  therefore  roaming services revenues are expected to continue to decrease at similar rates compared to prior periods 
gross margins for roaming services decreased from of roaming services revenues in to in and increased to in the gross margin increased slightly in due to negotiation of reduced rates for vendor telecommunications costs 
the decrease in resulted primarily from lower revenues and therefore lower absorption of fixed costs  higher revenue sharing rates paid to the company s carrier customers and higher vendor telecommunications costs 
the company anticipates that margins will decrease as revenues continue to decline 
systems in  the company began reporting inter segment revenues which are eliminated in consolidation from systems to prepaid services for v nodes and related equipment deployed during the year 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to permit comparison 
systems revenues decreased from million in to million in and increased to million in excluding inter segment revenues  systems revenues declined from million in to million in and million in the increase in gross systems revenues in reflects increased shipments of inter segment prepaid v nodes while external revenues remained fairly consistent 
the decrease in was due to a significant decline in orders for international prepaid systems 
gross margins for systems decreased from of systems revenues in to in excluding the effects of the one time charge discussed below and increased to of systems revenues in the increase in was a result of increased revenues for inter segment sales of voice nodes in addition to increased recurring service revenues that yield a higher margin 
the decrease in was primarily due to the reduced sales levels for that absorbed fewer fixed costs 
in addition  the gross margin was further reduced in as compared to by the one time charge of million recorded in the third quarter of for the reorganization of the systems business 
the charge principally related to expenses associated with inventory write downs to bring the level of inventory in line with the future sales strategy  as well as severance costs 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
all payments are received in us dollars  which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk

the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  seasonality  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  changes in regulations affecting the wireless industry  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  and general economic conditions 
in particular  prepaid wireless services revenues are affected by seasonal trends as the fourth quarter typically generates the highest number of net additions as compared to the other three quarters 
during the fourth quarter of  most of the company s carrier customers experienced the same seasonal trends  however  total company results were offset by lower than expected net additions from its largest customer  verizon wireless 
the timing of carrier contract renewals and the related minute of usage pricing can also impact prepaid wireless service revenues 
the company s roaming services revenues are affected by the frequency and volume of use of the company s service  which may also be influenced by seasonal trends 
the timing of orders and the number of large prepaid systems shipped during a particular quarter may fluctuate based upon the needs of the systems business customers and can have a significant impact on the level of revenues for the systems business 
because a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are committed in advance  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  unexpected revenue shortfalls could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of likely future performance 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million in to million in the increase was due to the company s improved cash flow from operations and million in net proceeds from the sale of the teleservices business 
net cash provided by operations of million in resulted from million in net income from continuing operations along with adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  income tax benefit from exercise of options of million  deferred income taxes of million  impairment charges of million and million in legal costs accrued 
in addition  million of cash was generated from improved collections of accounts receivable  inventory levels were reduced by million due to improved inventory management and the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million due to the timing of payments 
the company s investing activities utilized million of net cash in the company purchased capital equipment and software of million in  including million for telecommunications systems equipment and software for expansion of the company s ivsn and transaction processing platform 
the company also received million in net cash proceeds from the sale of the teleservices business and million in proceeds on sales of short term investments  net of purchases 
the company anticipates that over the next months it will continue to make significant capital investments for additional equipment and enhanced feature capabilities to strengthen its prepaid wireless services and other enhanced services 
the company s financing activities provided cash of million in  including proceeds of million from the exercise of options  net of million in capital lease repayments 
the company believes that its short term investments and the funds anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next months 
certain factors that may affect future results historically  a significant portion of the company s revenues in any particular period have been attributable to a limited number of customers 
this concentration of customers can cause the company s revenues and earnings to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on the volume of minutes of usage generated from these customers 
a significant decrease in business from any of the company s major customers  including a decrease in business due to factors outside the company control  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain prepaid wireless services contracts have been extended beyond their expiration dates or will expire in and beyond 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in renewing any of these contracts 
if any of these contracts are not renewed the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
also  when and if each of the contracts is renewed  some contractual rates per minute will likely be lower than in previous years 
if subscriber levels and minutes of usage begin to drop off  revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected due to these lower rates 
these contracts do not prevent the company s customers from offering wireless services like those offered by the company in house or by the company s competitors 
one of the company s former customers  rogers at t  did not renew its prepaid contract and brought its prepaid program in house 
in the first quarter of  the company expects approximately  subscribers to migrate off of the bcgi platform 
as a result  there can be no assurances that the prepaid wireless services gross margins will return to those levels attained in  excluding one time charges 
there can be no assurances that other customers will not follow suit and elect not to use the company s services to offer prepaid wireless services or that the company will be able to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully support and enhance the ivsn and transaction processing platform effectively to avoid system outages and any associated loss in revenue 
nor can there be any assurances that the market for the company s prepaid service will continue to develop  or that the company s ivsn and transaction processing platform will successfully support current and future growth 
furthermore  the company has expended significant amounts of capital to support the agreements it has secured with its carrier customers 
because prepaid revenues are principally generated by prepaid subscriber minutes of use  the company s revenues can be impacted by the carrier s ability to successfully market and sell prepaid services 
revenues from the company s prepaid wireless service business are dependent on the company s ability to retain subscribers on the network and there can be no assurance that the company s churn rate percentage of total subscribers that terminate service on the network will not increase 
any increase in the company s churn rate could result in reductions in related revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to replace these subscribers with new subscribers or that the company s other customers will not offer in house solutions that reduce the number of subscribers on the company s network 
the company is currently devoting significant resources toward the support and enhancement of its prepaid wireless services and systems to maintain system reliability and expand the ivsn and transaction processing platform 
the company has experienced network outages that have resulted in reductions in revenue due to penalty clauses contained in certain of the company s carrier customer contracts 
if the company s future efforts to avoid outages are unsuccessful  such outages could result in additional lost revenue for the company and damage the company s reputation 
the occurrence of one or more outages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company announced in that it had sold the assets of its teleservices business to teletech holdings  inc for million including the assumption of certain liabilities  with potential additional cash payments to the company of up to million through  based upon achievement of predetermined revenue targets 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in meeting the predetermined revenue targets or earning any of the potential cash payments available 
the company continues to invest in additional technologies including bcgi wireless wallet  datascape  inc  conference calling  an intelligent networking in prepaid wireless solution and other new applications to expand its prepaid wireless services business 
there can be no assurances that there will be a market for these technologies  that the company will be successful in marketing and selling these technologies in the marketplace or that the company will be able to leverage its existing infrastructure to provide these services in a cost effective manner 
in addition  the failure of any of these technologies may result in asset impairment charges or other write offs could materially and adversely affect the company s overall business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and such fluctuations may continue and could intensify 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  variations in subscriber additions and minutes of use  the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of services provided by the company  the loss of customers  seasonal trends  variations in the level of system sales  changes in the company s operating expenses  the ability to identify  hire and retain qualified personnel and general economic conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s results of operations will be below prior results or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in september  a reorganization plan was implemented in an effort to realign the systems business and reduce operating expenses 
the company has reduced operating expenses and stabilized the division  however  there can be no assurances that the systems business operating losses excluding inter segment revenues will not increase or that it may incur asset impairment charges or other write offs that could materially and adversely affect the company s overall business  operating results and financial condition 
the company historically has provided its services almost exclusively to wireless carriers 
although the wireless telecommunications market has experienced significant growth in recent years  there can be no assurance that such growth will continue at similar rates  or at all  or that wireless carriers will continue to use the company s services 
the company expects that demand for its roaming services will continue to decline as consolidation in the wireless industry reduces the number of unregistered roamers and carriers offer more national one rate roaming plans 
in addition  prepaid wireless services are relatively new services in new markets 
if the growth in prepaid services does not materialize as expected or if the carriers in these markets do not use the company s services  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s future success depends  in large part  on the continued use of its existing services and systems  the acceptance of new services in the wireless industry and the company s ability to develop new services and systems or adapt existing services or systems to keep pace with changes in the wireless industry 
furthermore  a rapid shift away from the use of wireless in favor of other services could affect demand for the company s service offerings and could require the company to develop modified or alternative service offerings to address the particular needs of the providers of such new services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or marketing its existing or future service offerings or systems in a timely manner  or at all 
the company has expanded its operations rapidly  creating significant demands on the company s management  administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of the company s operations 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of the company s services  its ability to retain key personnel and its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s operations are supported by many hardware components and software applications from third party vendors  sometimes licensed from single vendors  which are sometimes small corporations 
there can be no assurances that these hardware components and software applications will function in accordance with specifications agreed upon by the company and its vendors  that these suppliers will continue to license this software to the company or  if any supplier terminates its agreement with the company  that the company will be able to develop or otherwise procure software from another supplier on a timely basis and at commercially acceptable prices 
if the hardware and software do not function as specified or if the company can no longer license software from certain vendors or otherwise obtain the software  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many systems customers are multinational corporations that are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars that help to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
the market for services to wireless carriers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
a number of companies currently offer one or more of the services offered by the company 
in addition  many wireless carriers are providing  or can provide in house  the services that the company offers 
in addition  the company anticipates continued growth and competition in the wireless carrier services industry and  consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
an important factor in the future success of the company s prepaid wireless service will be the company s ability to provide  at competitive prices  more functionality and features than those typically available in other competitive offerings 
an increase in competition or the inability of the company to provide  at competitive prices  more functionality and features could result in price reductions and loss of market share and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology and its ability to protect such technology 
the company continues to defend its proprietary technology against patent infringement litigation  including the freedom wireless lawsuit 
if patent infringement judgments are entered against the company or unauthorized copying or misuse of the company s technology were to occur to any substantial degree  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer  switching and other telecommunications equipment and systems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
any damage  failure or delay that causes interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
proposals to intensify or reduce government regulations continue to be discussed at both the federal and state levels 
such changes may decrease the growth of the wireless telephone industry  result in new competitors or industry consolidation  limit the number of potential customers for the company s services or impede the company s ability to offer competitive services to the wireless market or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio in accordance with its investment policy 
the primary objectives of its investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  the company s investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
while the company s investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase  the company typically holds all of its investments until maturity 
however  since the investments are typically held to maturity and are generally conservative in nature and of relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
the company does not own derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the interest rates on the company s capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
the company currently prices and sells all of its systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many of the systems business customers are multinational corporations  which are publicly traded in the us all payments are received in us dollars  which helps to protect the company from the need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
while these provisions serve to protect the company from accounts receivable losses  there can be no assurances that systems sales to foreign countries will not result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions outside of the company s control 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item
