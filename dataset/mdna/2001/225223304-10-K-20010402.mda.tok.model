factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and under business factors that could affect future results 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview we design  develop  market and service high performance computer systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
we presently market two computer systems  the cray sv and te  and provide maintenance services to the world wide installed base of these and earlier models of cray computers 
we are developing enhancements to the cray sv  and we are developing three new computer systems  the mta  based on our multithreaded architecture system  the super cluster  a highly parallel system using leading commercial off the shelf components  and the sv  which will combine elements of the sv and te computers 
in we largely were involved in the separation of the cray research operations from those of sgi and integrating them with our own 
this process included establishing separate network  communications and other infrastructure services  reconstituting the marketing and sales operations  setting up subsidiary operations for international sales and services  implementing new operational policies and procedures  and identifying and filling openings in management  administration and other areas 
we have experienced net losses in each year of operations 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in we recognize revenue from sales of our computer systems upon acceptance by the customer  although depending on sales contract terms  revenue may be recognized when title passes upon shipment or may be delayed until funding is certain 
we recognize service revenue from the maintenance of our computer systems ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement 
factors that should be considered in evaluating our business  operations and prospects and that may affect our future results and financial condition are set forth above  beginning on page results of operations years ended december   and with the acquisition of the cray research business unit on april   period to period comparisons of our operating results that include periods prior to the acquisition are not indicative of results for any future period 
revenue 
we had revenue from product sales of million for  up from million in and million in product revenue represented of total revenues for and consisted primarily of million for our sv product line and million for our te product line 
revenues included million from the upgrade of the mta system at the san diego supercomputer center sdsc to eight processors  and revenues included million from the sale of the two processor mta system to sdsc  our first revenue as tera computer company from product sales 
we had service revenue of million for  up from  in and  in services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods 
the overall increase in service revenue is due to the acquisition of the cray product line and related service business in april we expect service revenue to decline slowly over the next year or so as older systems are withdrawn from service and then to stabilize as our new systems are placed in service 
service revenue represented of total revenues for operating expenses 
cost of product revenue was million for  million for and million for cost of product revenue for represented of product revenue for the high cost of product revenue in is due to the age of the sv and te product lines and inventory adjustments for sv and mta gallium arsenide parts 
cost of product revenue was high in and as a percentage of the revenue due to the inclusion of manufacturing costs and inventory adjustments relating to the mta product line and favorable pricing terms provided to our first mta customer 
cost of service revenue was million for   for and  for cost of service revenue for was net of of warranty reserve utilization 
cost of service revenue represented of service revenues for research and development expenses reflect our costs associated with the enhancements to the cray sv and te systems and the development of the mta and sv systems  including related software development 
these costs also include personnel expenses  allocated overhead and operating expenses  software  materials and engineering expenses  including payments to third parties 
these costs are offset in part by governmental development funding 
net research and development expenses were million in  million for and million for research and development expenses in represented of revenue 
we expect that research and development expenses will decrease slightly in  with increases in engineering personnel  principally software engineers  being offset by decreases in third party non recurring engineering expenses as we complete development of the mta and sv systems 
in subsequent years  unless we obtain additional governmental development funding to replace funding for projects as they are completed  the net amount of research and development expenditures will increase 
over time  with receipt of increased revenue from products currently under development and sales of the nec sx series of computers  we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of overall revenue 
marketing and sales expense were million in  million in and million in the increase in these expenses for over was due to the acquisition of the cray research business unit  which required us to re establish the cray sales and customer support staff and increase expenditures in connection with sales and marketing  benchmarks and development of third party applications software 
the increase in these expenses for over was due largely to higher wages and operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were million for  million in and million in the increase in these expenses for over was due to the acquisition of the cray research operations  which required us to add managerial and administrative staff and increases in legal  accounting and consulting expenses in connection with establishing foreign operations and implementing new accounting systems 
the increase in expenses over was due largely to higher wages  and operating costs associated with being a publicly owned company 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase as we complete our administrative staffing  but should decline as a percentage of revenue 
we incurred amortization expense of million in primarily related to the goodwill and intangible assets from the acquisition of the cray research business unit 
interest income expense 
interest income was  for   for  and  for  reflecting the company s increased cash position due to the sales of equity securities in the first quarter of  and in and interest expense was million for   for and  for the increase in was largely due to imputed interest expense of million for on the non interest bearing note issued to sgi  a non cash interest expense of approximately  associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain investor promissory notes  a non cash expense of  for the value of warrants issued in conjunction with investor promissory notes and  of interest paid on a line of credit 
the increase in was largely due to a non cash interest expense of approximately  associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain convertible promissory notes issued in the first quarter of the results also include a non cash expense for the value of detachable warrants issued in conjunction with convertible promissory notes  of which  was recognized upon conversion in the second quarter of taxes 
we made a provision of  for international income taxes in as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which expire in years through  if not utilized 
preferred stock 
in the second quarter of  all of our outstanding preferred stock was converted to common stock 
the dividends for were accrued on our series a convertible preferred stock  and were higher than that accrued during the comparable period of because we had more shares of preferred stock then outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  compared to million at december  restricted cash balances  which serve as collateral for capital equipment loans and leases  totaled  at december   and million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used of million in on a pro forma basis  in the nine months subsequent to the cray acquisition we had net cash provided by operating activities of million 
for  net operating cash flows were primarily attributed to increases in depreciation and amortization  accounts payable and deferred revenue offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and warranty reserves 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to  for in  we paid a total of million to sgi to acquire the cray research business unit 
we also spent million on fixed assets  primarily consisting of computer hardware and software and electronic test equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for in  we raised million in a private placement of million shares of common stock and million from the exercise of common stock warrants 
we also raised million through the issuance of promissory notes to two investors  retiring million of these notes by year end through conversion into common stock 
subsequent to december   we have paid the remaining million principal amount and interest through sales of common stock to the investors 
over the next twelve months our significant cash requirements relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory and third party engineering expenses  and acquisition of property and equipment 
these expenses include our commitments to acquire components and manufacturing and engineering services 
we expect that anticipated product sales and maintenance services over the next twelve months will generate positive cash flow from operations 
we secured a million credit facility in march  and expect that the nec distribution agreement will be completed in the second quarter of  at which time nec will invest million in us 
at any particular time  given the high average selling price of our products  our cash position is affected by the timing of product sales and the receipt of prepaid maintenance revenue 
in addition  delays in the development of the svex  mta and supercluster systems  all planned to be completed in the next twelve months  and the sv system may require additional capital earlier than planned 
while we believe our cash resources will be adequate for the next months  we may need to raise additional equity and or debt capital through our shelf registration statement  private placements and or enhanced credit facilities 
if we are successful in our product development and market conditions were favorable  we may wish to consider financings to enhance our cash position and working capital position 
financings may not be available to us when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms and may be dilutive to our shareholders 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june  which is effective for the company beginning january  sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
since we do not currently hold any derivative instruments  sfas no 
is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the united states securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which was required to be adopted in the company s fourth fiscal quarter of sab no 
provides guidance on revenue recognition and the sec staff s views on the application of accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 which addresses certain accounting issues which arose under the previously established accounting principles relating to stock based compensation 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in money market funds or commercial paper of less than days that is held to maturity 
accordingly  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we sell our products primarily in north america  but with significant sales in asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced in us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we commonly sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts occasionally call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
we believe that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on the financial statements 
our foreign maintenance contracts are paid in local currencies and provide a natural hedge against local expenses 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
we do not hold any derivative instruments and have not engaged in hedging transactions
