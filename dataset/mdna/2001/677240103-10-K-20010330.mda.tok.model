item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the year ended with the corporation experiencing deterioration in certain lines of business  price inadequacies  and rising underwriting expenses 
the corporation responded in with a plan to aggressively manage expenses  implement price increases  and cancel or non renew its most unprofitable business 
results of operations for the year  the corporation reported a net operating loss of million or per share  compared with operating income of million or 
per share in and million or per share in contributing to the net loss were the adverse effects of write offs to the agent relationships intangible asset relating to the acquisition of the great american insurance companies gai commercial lines division  the impact of inadequate pricing  and premium cessions on experience rated reinsurance contracts 
positively impacting results was the settlement of the california proposition liability 
in the first quarter of  the group made the strategic decision to discontinue its relationship with managing general agents 
the decision was made to help give the group better control of its underwriting and pricing practices 
the managing general agents accounted for approximately million in annual commercial lines premium written  of which million was in the workers compensation line of business 
this business  which was acquired in the gai commercial lines purchase in  is being non renewed as permitted by law and contractual agreements 
the result of the decision was a write off of million of the agent relationships intangible asset  specifically relating to the managing general agents  which was recorded on the balance sheet in connection with the gai purchase 
the asset was also written off in by million as a result of additional agent cancellations for a total write off of million for the year 
the operating loss was also impacted negatively by million for ceded premiums on certain experience rated reinsurance contracts covering losses exceeding million 
the operating income was impacted by million for similar premium cessions 
these premium cessions reflect changes in estimated loss experience  and have resulted in the maximum premium cessions under these contracts for business written through year the consolidated net loss for was million or per share  compared with net income of million or per share in  and million or per share in after tax realized gains losses were million in  million in  and million in contributing to the gain were investment gains from a reallocation of the group s investment portfolio during the second quarter of the corporation completed the reallocation by selling approximately million in equity securities  resulting in after tax realized gains of approximately million 
statutory net premiums written decreased million in to billion 
net premiums written totaled billion in and billion in the net premiums written decrease in can be attributed to a more conservative underwriting philosophy that led to the non renewal of certain business  the effects of annualization of new jersey private passenger automobile policies  and the premium cessions on experience rated reinsurance contracts mentioned previously 
in order to improve underwriting results  the corporation took action in to cancel its most unprofitable agents and policies 
these actions  along with the item continued cancellation of the managing general agents  represent annual net premiums written of over million 
the full impact of these actions should be realized in the increase in premiums from to was due to the gai acquisition adding almost million to net premiums over the combined ratio increased points to in  compared with in and in the poor combined ratio was driven by increases in the loss and loss expense ratios 
the calendar year loss ratio was compared with in and in the loss ratio was impacted by adverse development in the workers compensation and general liability lines of business for and prior accident years 
the workers compensation line of business added points to the overall loss ratio 
deterioration in the private passenger automobile results driven in part by the mandatory rollback of rates for new jersey also affected the loss ratio results 
finally  inadequate pricing and a increase in claims severity for workers compensation business also contributed to the increased loss ratio 
in order to resolve pricing inadequacies  the group began implementing price increases across all commercial lines and some personal lines in the average price increase was approximately on the group s commercial lines book of business 
the effects of these increases should be realized in as premiums are earned 
the accident year loss ratio  which measures losses and claims arising from insured events during the year was  points lower than the calendar year result  which includes loss payments made during the current year and changes in the provision for future loss payments 
the difference is concentrated in the general liability and workers compensation lines 
at year end  the group reallocated its carried bulk reserves to comply with statement of statutory accounting principles no 
under statutory accounting codification  which requires that companies carry their best estimate of loss reserves for each line of business  while previous requirements focused on the overall results 
the reallocation  while not affecting the overall calendar year combined ratio  had a material impact on the reported combined ratios for several lines of business 
underwriting expenses  as a percentage of net premiums written  decreased by 
points in to  compared with in and in as mentioned earlier  the corporation took steps in to aggressively manage expenses 
the savings focused on reductions to salaries and related expenses  advertising  and professional contractor fees 
these expense reduction efforts were expected to result in annualized expense savings of approximately million 
due to the timing of severance payments and the run off of contractual commitments  the corporation estimated half of the reported amount would be realized in the corporation exceeded its expense savings estimates for by realizing almost million in expense reductions 
the increase in over was primarily due to expenses related to restructuring and integration efforts  which added approximately points to the underwriting expense ratio 
acquisitions as described in more detail in note  the group purchased substantially all of the commercial lines division of great american insurance companies gai on december  the acquisition has been treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
the revenues and results reported include the activity of the gai division from the december  acquisition date forward 
item continued line of business discussion workers compensation continued deterioration in the workers compensation line of business in led to disappointing results for the line in general as well as affecting the group s overall results for the year 
including the year end reserve reallocation mentioned in the results of operation section  the workers compensation line of business added points to the overall loss ratio 
workers compensation combined ratio increased points in to  compared with and for and  respectively 
excluding the year end reserve reallocation  the combined ratio was 
the loss ratio was the main component driving the high combined ratio 
due to rising medical costs causing an increase in claims severity and the effects of the year end reserve reallocation  the loss ratio swelled to compared with and in and  respectively 
the group was able to achieve an average renewal price increase for the workers compensation line of business of for in response to the deterioration of results  the group is non renewing its most unprofitable segment of workers compensation policies  which amount to approximately million in annual premium volume 
this business has a loss ratio approximately points higher than the total workers compensation line of business and is referred to as unsupported workers compensation as it is the only product in the customer s account 
as mentioned in the results of operations section  the group has also taken action to discontinue its relationship with managing general agents 
these managing general agents accounted for million in annual workers compensation premium volume 
the non renewal of unsupported workers compensation impacted premiums written by an estimated million in  with the remaining business to be non renewed in the cancellation of managing general agents impacted premiums written by an estimated million in  with the remaining million to effect results 
these non renewals and cancellations contributed to a or million decrease in workers compensation net premiums written  which totaled million 
net premiums written for and totaled million and million  respectively 
the business acquired from gai contributed to the increase in from private passenger auto agency net premiums written decreased million or to million in  compared with million in and million in net premiums written were positively impacted by the conversion to twelve month policies in new jersey  from the standard six month policy issued 
additionally  the state mandated rate rollback effective in early reduced premium volume for a portion of and for a full year in new jersey s private passenger auto net premiums written represent approximately of the group s total private passenger auto book of business 
the combined ratio increased to in from in and in an increase in claims severity in contributed to the increase in the overall combined ratio 
see discussion of new jersey regulatory developments in item  page item continued private passenger auto direct the group began direct marketing of personal auto coverage in january in  the corporation first restructured its avomark operations with an internet only strategy  and later discontinued the private passenger auto direct line of business in the fourth quarter 
as part of this restructuring  the company completed an asset purchase agreement for the sale of the avomark call center 
under this agreement  the buyer purchased certain assets used in the call center operation and entered into a new lease on the call center property  thereby replacing the company as lessee 
the line was discontinued in order to focus on the independent agency system as the distribution channel for the group 
as a result of the restructuring  net premiums written dropped from million in to million in the group wrote million of net premiums in combined ratios were   and for   and  respectively 
although the corporation discontinued the avomark line  the corporation remains committed to developing internet capabilities that focus on increased service support for agents and their customers  and our policyholders 
commercial auto net premiums written increased million or in to million  compared with million in and million in the increase was driven by renewal price increases  averaging on the commercial auto line of business 
the increase in premiums between and was largely due to the gai acquisition 
the combined ratio increased to  compared with in and in was hindered by increased severity and large losses combined with inadequate pricing 
commercial multi peril  fire inland marine cmp net premiums written from the cmp segment have increased for five consecutive years 
net premiums written increased million or to million in  compared to million in and million in the implementation of renewal price increases contributed to the premium increase 
acquired business from gai contributed million to the increase when compared to the combined ratio decreased to in from in and in in  the group was able to implement renewal price increases in the cmp segment 
although the renewal price increases climbed each quarter of the year  the full effects will not be realized until catastrophe losses added points to the combined ratio in  points in and points in general liability net premiums written decreased million or in to million  compared with million in and million in the decrease reflected the group s focus on fundamental underwriting strategies 
item continued the combined ratio increased points in due to adverse development for and prior accident years to  compared with in and in this line continues to be subject to inadequate pricing arising from intense competition 
while profitable premium growth remains very difficult to achieve  the group is focusing efforts on underwriting integrity 
umbrella net premiums written increased million or in to million  compared with million in and million in the increase was primarily generated by renewal price increases implemented in the increase between and was due to the gai acquisition adding million in premiums 
the acquisition brought excess coverages that were new to the group allowing for increased limits  broadened classes and improved coverage forms 
the combined ratio was  compared with in and in although the combined ratio increased  the results are still below the industry average 
homeowners net premiums written fell in to million from million in and million in over the past two years  the group has placed emphasis on selective underwriting and the homeowners insurance to value program 
the program addresses underinsured homeowner properties and emphasizes adequate replacement cost values 
upon renewal  homeowner s accounts are subject to a replacement cost valuation and appropriate premium increases are implemented 
the insurance to value program has contributed to the group implementing an average price increase of more than during the year the combined ratio decreased points to 
this compares with a combined ratio of in and in combined ratios are heavily impacted by catastrophe losses which added points to the combined ratio in  points in and points in fidelity surety net premiums written decreased

catastrophe losses in millions statutory surplus statutory surplus  a traditional insurance industry measure of strength and underwriting capacity  was million at december   compared with million at december  and  million at december  the decrease in the surplus was due primarily to poor underwriting results  dividend payments  and the statutory treatment of the final installment payment for the acquisition of the commercial lines division of gai 
the decrease in resulted from dividends  poor underwriting results and taxes on realized gains 
liquidity and financial strength net cash generated from operations was million in  compared with cash used of million in and cash generated of million in the change in is due in part to payment received in as part of the commutation of a reinsurance treaty in the fourth quarter of  a refund of prior year taxes paid  a reduction in paid losses and paid loss item continued adjustment expenses  and a reduction in paid underwriting expenses as a result of the expense management efforts 
the decrease in  compared with  primarily resulted from lower operating income 
investing activities used net cash of million in  compared with net cash produced of million in and million in total cash used for financing activities was million in  compared with million in and total cash produced of million in cash used from financing decreased in as a result of the reduction in shareholder dividends and the corporation s decision not to repurchase any of its treasury shares 
overall  total cash used in was million  compared with million in and cash generated of million in shareholder dividend payments were million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in was a result of the corporation s decision to reduce quarterly dividend payments beginning in the second quarter to 
per share in order to strengthen the financial position of the corporation 
on february   the corporation eliminated its current quarterly dividend in order to further strengthen the corporation s financial position 
cash flow has also been impacted by our share repurchase program 
although the corporation did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in  the corporation did repurchase  shares for million in and  shares for million in the corporation is currently authorized to repurchase  additional shares of its common stock to be held as treasury shares for stock options or other general corporate purposes 
since the beginning of  million shares have been repurchased at an average cost of per share 
in the future  shares will be repurchased when doing so makes economic sense for the corporation and its shareholders 
in order to evaluate corporate performance  the corporation calculates a five year average return on equity 
net income and unrealized gains and losses on investments are included in the calculation to derive a total return 
a five year average is used to correspond to the corporation s planning horizon and emphasizes long term returns  not intermediate fluctuations 
the five year average return on equity was  and for  and  respectively 
the corporation is dependent on dividend payments from its insurance subsidiaries in order to meet operating expenses  debt obligations  and to pay dividends 
insurance regulatory authorities impose various restrictions and prior approval requirements on the payment of dividends by insurance companies and holding companies 
as of december   approximately million of retained earnings were not subject to regulatory restriction or prior dividend approval requirements 
as of december   the corporation had million of outstanding notes payable 
of the million  million is related to a low interest loan outstanding with the state of ohio used in conjunction with the home office purchase 
the remaining million is related to a credit facility that provided a million revolving line of credit to the corporation 
the agreement expires in october  with any outstanding loan balance due at that time 
the credit facility agreement contains financial covenants and provisions customary for such arrangements 
the most restrictive covenants include a maximum permissible consolidated funded debt that cannot exceed of consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the agreement and a minimum statutory surplus of million 
the corporation continues to review its financial covenants in the credit agreement in light of its operating losses 
as of item continued december   the corporation was in compliance with these covenants 
however  further deterioration of operating results  reductions in the equity portfolio valuation  or other changes in statutory surplus  including the effects of adopting new statutory accounting principles such as codification  may lead to covenant violations which could ultimately result in default 
the corporation is evaluating its capital requirements and is exploring ways to restructure and or reduce its debt and strengthen its financial position 
the corporation has taken steps to strengthen its financial position by aggressively managing expenses and first reducing quarterly dividends to shareholders and later eliminating the current quarterly dividend in the first quarter of the corporation may be required to obtain additional external funding  either in the form of debt or equity funding  to support its insurance operations in the future 
while the corporation believes that it should be able to obtain such external funding  if needed  the availability of such funding cannot be assured nor can the cost of such funding be evaluated at this time 
regularly the group s financial strength is reviewed by independent rating agencies 
these agencies may upgrade  downgrade  or affirm their previous rating of the group 
during  a 
m 
best and standard and poor s s p rating services downgraded the group s financial strength ratings 
the group s am best rating moved from a superior to a excellent and the s p rating moved from a to bbb

a 
m 
best and s p both recognized the group s strong capitalization and expense reduction efforts as positive attributes 
moody s investors service affirmed the group s a rating based on capitalization and expense reduction measures 
all three rating agencies recognized the shift in management focus to improve underwriting 
restructuring in december  the group initiated a restructuring and reorganization plan 
under the plan  the group consolidated many of its branch locations for underwriting and claims throughout personal lines business centers were reduced from five to three locations 
commercial underwriting branches were reduced from to eight locations and claims branches were reduced from to six locations 
workforce reductions related to the restructuring plan  originally estimated to be positions  have amounted to approximately positions 
the plan was estimated to generate million in annual pre tax savings upon full implementation in late the actual savings in were approximately million 
restructuring charges recorded in were made up of expenses associated with abandoned lease space totaling million or 
per share before tax and million or 
per share after tax 
the group released million and million of the liability due to payments under leases in and  respectively  and million in for changes in assumptions used to establish the initial reserve 
discontinued operations during  the corporation s life operations were discontinued 
in order to exit the life operations the company executed an agreement in to reinsure the existing blocks of business through a coinsurance arrangement 
item continued since the ohio life insurance company was contractually replaced as the primary insurer  the corporation recognized unamortized ceding commission of million before tax in and million in on december   the company sold of the ohio life insurance company stock  thereby transferring all remaining assets and liabilities to the buyer 
the after tax gain on this sale totaled million or 
per share 
net income from discontinued operations amounted to million or 
per share in  compared with million or 
per share in loss and loss adjustment expenses the group s largest liabilities are reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established for all incurred claims and are carried on an undiscounted basis before any credits for reinsurance recoverable 
these reserves amounted to billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  in recent years  environmental liability claims have expanded greatly in the insurance industry 
the group has a substantially different mix of business than the industry 
we have historically written small commercial accounts  and have not attracted significant manufacturing liability coverage 
as a result  our environmental liability claims are substantially below the industry average 
our liability business reflected our current mix of approximately contractors  building premises  mercantile and only manufacturers 
within the manufacturing category  we have concentrated on the light manufacturers  which further limits our exposure to environmental claims 
estimated asbestos and environmental reserves are composed of case reserves  incurred but not reported reserves and reserves for loss adjustment expense 
for  and  respectively  those reserves were million  million and million 
asbestos reserves were million  million and million and environmental reserves were million  million and million for those respective years 
these loss estimates are based on currently available information 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and legislatures  there is some uncertainty as to the ultimate liability 
the group changed its pollution exclusion policy language between and to effectively eliminate these coverages 
california proceedings proposition was passed in the state of california in in an attempt to legislate premium rates for that state 
the proposition required premium rate rollbacks for california policyholders while allowing for a fair return for insurance companies 
in  the administrative law judge issued a proposed ruling with a rollback liability of million plus interest 
the group established a contingent liability for the proposition rollback of million plus simple interest at from may  this brought the total reserve to million at september  on october   the group announced a settlement agreement for california proposition that was approved by the commissioner of insurance of the state of california 
under the terms of the settlement  the members of the group will pay item continued million in refund premiums to eligible california policyholders 
the corporation expects the payments to be made in the first half of with this development  the total reserve was decreased to million as of september  when the refund payments occur  the remaining million liability will be extinguished 
this decrease in the reserve resulted in an increase in operating income and net income for the third quarter  but had no effect on the combined ratio reported 
to date  the group has paid approximately million in legal costs related to the california withdrawal and proposition investments consolidated pre tax investment income from continuing operations increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in investment income can be attributed to the second quarter reallocation in the investment portfolio from equity securities to investment grade securities 
also contributing to the increase has been the reallocation of investments from tax exempt municipal bonds to taxable bonds 
after tax investment income totaled million in  compared with million in and million in pre tax and after tax investment income comparisons are impacted by investments in municipal bonds  which provide tax free investment income 
at year end  consolidated investments had a carrying value of billion 
the excess of market value over cost was million  compared with million at year end and million at year end the increase was due to market growth in both the fixed income and equity portfolios  while the decrease in unrealized gains was largely attributable to the group s reallocation of its investment portfolio mentioned in the results of operations section 
the reallocation resulted in million of unrealized gains being recognized 
consolidated after tax realized investment gains losses from continuing operations amounted to million in  compared with million in and million in the realized loss was impacted by approximately million due to the write down of securities for other than temporary declines in market value 
the portfolio reallocation led to the large realized gain in the corporation s fixed income portfolio has an intermediate duration and a laddered maturity structure 
the corporation does not try to time markets  instead  always choosing to remain fully invested 
tax exempt bonds decreased to of the fixed income portfolio at year end versus and for december  and  respectively 
the funds previously held in tax exempt bonds have been reallocated to investment grade taxable bonds 
due to recent poor operating results  the corporation has reduced its holdings during and in order to maximize after tax income 
as of december   the corporation held  million in mortgage backed securities  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
the and increases are attributable to a redistribution of investments previously held in tax exempt bonds and the reallocation mentioned above 
the majority of mortgage backed security holdings are less volatile planned amortization class  sequential structures and agency pass through securities 
of this portfolio  million  million and million were invested in more volatile bond classes eg interest only  super floaters  inverses in  and  respectively 
item continued at year end  consolidated equity investments had a market value of million 
equity investments have decreased as a percentage of the consolidated portfolio from in to at year end this decrease is attributable to the reallocation of the group s investment portfolio

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments market risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and market prices 
in addition to market risk  the corporation is exposed to other risks such as credit  reinvestment and liquidity risk 
credit risk refers to the financial risk that an obligation will not be paid and a loss will result 
reinvestment risk is the risk that interest rates will fall causing interim cash flows to earn less than the original investment 
liquidity risk describes the ease with which an investment can readily be sold without substantially affecting the asset s price

the corporation attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through item a 
continued active portfolio management and periodic reviews of asset and liability positions 
estimates of cash flows and the impact of interest rate fluctuations relating to the corporation s investment portfolio are modeled semi annually and reviewed regularly 
equity price risk equity price risk can be separated into two elements 
the first  systematic risk  is the portion of a portfolio or individual security s price movement attributed to stock market movement as a whole 
the second element  nonsystematic risk  is the portion of price movement unique to the individual portfolio or security 
this risk can be further divided between industry characteristics and the individual issuer 
the corporation attempts to manage nonsystematic risk by monitoring a portfolio that is diversified across industries 
the following tables illustrate the hypothetical effect of an increase in interest rates of basis points and a decrease in equity values at december   and  respectively 
the changes selected above reflect the corporation s view of shifts in rates and values that are quite possible over a one year period 
these rates should not be considered a prediction of future events by the corporation 
this analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity prices on the corporation s income  cash flow or shareholders equity

certain assumptions are inherent in the above analysis 
the corporation assumes an instantaneous and parallel shift in interest rates and equity prices at december   and and that the composition of its investment portfolio remains relatively constant 
also  the corporation assumes a change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across all financial instruments 
the adjusted market values are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling
