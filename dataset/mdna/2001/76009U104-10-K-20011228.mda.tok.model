item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is primarily due to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
as of september   the company had million in loans with floating interest rates indexed to current libor and prime rates 
because the floating rates expose the company to the risk of increased interest cost if interest rates rise  the company began a policy in of managing interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the floating interest rate loans to fixed interest rates 
as of september   the company has million in interest rate swap agreements that fix in a libor rate ranging from to 
this effectively fixes the interest rate on million of loans  thus hedging this risk 
these interest rate swap agreements have maturities ranging from to given the company s current capital structure  including interest rate swap agreements  there is million  or of the company s total debt  in floating rate loans 
a hypothetical basis point change in the libor rate would affect pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
seasonality and inflation management believes that operating results may be subject to seasonality 
in particular  the fourth quarter generally exhibits a slight tightening of customer spending habits commensurate with summer vacations  back to school needs and other factors 
conversely  the first quarter typically has a greater percentage of rentals because of traditional holiday shopping patterns 
management plans for these seasonal variances and takes particular advantage of the first quarter with product promotions  marketing campaigns  and employee incentives 
because many of the company s expenses do not fluctuate with seasonal revenue changes  such revenue changes may cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly earnings 
during the year ended september   the costs of rental merchandise  store lease rental expense and salaries and wages have increased modestly 
these increases have not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations because the company has been able to charge commensurately higher rental for its merchandise 
this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future
