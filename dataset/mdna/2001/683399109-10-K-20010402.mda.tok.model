item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used herein  the words may  will  expects  anticipates  estimates  intends  plans  predicts  potential  believe  should and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under business and additional business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are developing innovative products for the treatment of cancer 
based on our proprietary virus technology  we are developing our lead product  ci we have completed two phase ii clinical trials evaluating ci as a treatment for head and neck cancer 
based on the data from these trials  we initiated a patient  multi center phase iii clinical trial of ci administered by intratumoral injection in patients with head and neck cancer 
this phase iii clinical trial is being conducted in conjunction with warner lambert  our collaborator for the development and commercialization of ci we are also evaluating ci in clinical trials for several additional cancer indications 
in addition to ci  we are conducting a number of research and development programs based on our virus technology as well as our small molecule drug discovery efforts 
in collaboration with bayer corporation  we have initiated a phase i clinical trial of a raf kinase inhibitor in patients with cancer 
further  we are developing human viruses that selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells based on mutations or loss of function of the retinoblastoma  or rb  tumor suppressor gene 
pending the final results of ongoing preclinical studies  we intend to file an ind for a product candidate from the rb program in we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to expenses associated with the expansion of our self funded virus research and development programs 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of the ci clinical trials  dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of proposed products in the foreseeable future 
we expect that all of our revenues in the foreseeable future will be generated from collaboration agreements 
in january  we signed a process development and manufacturing agreement with xoma us llc 
under the terms of the agreement  xoma will develop a large scale process and will manufacture ci for clinical trials and commercial production 
in march  we sold and issued  shares of common stock to warner lambert in a private placement  at a price of per share  for aggregate net proceeds of million 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue 
our total revenues in each of the last three years were derived almost exclusively from collaborative research and development programs with warner lambert  bayer eli lilly company 
the approximate revenue from each of our programs  and other sources for each of the past three years was as follows year ended december  in millions warner lambert ci and armed therapeutic viruses cell cycle inflammation bayer eli lilly company total contract revenues all other sources total revenues total revenues increased by percent from to and percent from to  in each case primarily as a result of increased contract revenues 
total contract revenues increased in from total contract revenues in because we recognized a full year of revenues under the warner lambert ci and armed virus collaboration agreement  including a million payment received upon the completion of a research milestone 
this collaboration agreement was in effect for only four months of total contract revenues are expected to decrease in from total contract revenues in because the cell cycle and inflammation collaboration agreements with warner lambert are due to expire in august we do not anticipate extending the research term beyond this date 
in january  our research collaboration with bayer concluded 
based on this research  we and bayer identified a development candidate  and we are co funding clinical trials with bayer 
as a result  we did not recognize any revenue in from this program 
in june  the collaboration program with eli lilly company expired pursuant to the terms of the agreement and as a result  we will not recognize any future revenues under this program 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the expense increase of percent was primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses 
in collaboration with bayer  we have initiated a phase i clinical trial of a raf kinase inhibitor and are currently co funding percent of clinical development costs 
also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses for were contract manufacturing expenses as production increased to provide ci for our phase iii clinical trials and various phase i ii clinical trials 
the expense decrease of seven percent was primarily due to the transition of the ras program from research to development 
we expect to continue to expand the scope of our self funded virus research and development programs in future periods  which may result in substantial increases in research and development expenses 
collaborators may not fund these research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  and million in and the expense increase of percent was primarily due to increased employee related expenses for the hiring of additional staff 
general and administrative expenses for and remained at essentially the same level 
it is anticipated that general and administrative expenses may increase moderately in future periods to support our research and development efforts 
net interest income 
we had net interest income of million in  million in and million in the increase in net interest income in was principally due to the increased cash and investment balances from the million private placement financing of common stock in january  the million common stock issuance to warner lambert in february  and the million follow on public offering of common stock in october this resulted in more interest income for the year ended december  net interest income decreased by percent in primarily due to a lower average balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
income taxes since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately million and for state income tax purposes were approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our cash expenditures have substantially exceeded our revenues  and we have relied primarily on the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and revenue from collaborative research and development agreements to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash and investments of million  compared to million at december   and million at december  the increase of million in was attributable to several sources 
in january  we completed a private placement of common stock  which raised million 
in february  we sold common stock to warner lambert  which raised million 
in october  we raised million of net proceeds from our public offering of million shares of our common stock 
in addition  we received million of cash from the exercise of stock options by our employees 
these increases were partially offset by cash used in operations of million  the repayment of debt of million and capital expenditures of million 
the decrease of million in was primarily due to cash used in operations of million  repayment of debt of million and capital expenditures of million 
our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the cash was used primarily to fund increasing levels of research and development and the general and administrative expenses necessary to support increased operations 
expenditures for capital equipment amounted to million in  as compared to million in  and million in we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million in we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon including the million received from warner lambert in march and anticipated revenues from existing collaborations will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through mid changes in our research and development plans  revenues from collaborators or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in the expenditure of these resources before mid  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in future periods 
we intend to seek this additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  announced the delay of the effective date of statement of financial reporting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas also  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial reporting standards no 
 an amendment to sfas sfas  as amended  required that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
change in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
we must adopt sfas as amended  on january  management does not currently expect that adoption of sfas  as amended  will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no fin clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
and was effective july  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flow 
in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
our current revenue recognition policy is consistent with the guidance of sab  therefore  the adoption of sab on january   had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we classify our cash equivalents or short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on an instrument remains fixed over its term 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as fixed rate 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of onyx s cash equivalents and short term investments at december  maturity fair value in millions average interest rate cash equivalents  fixed rate daily short term investments  fixed rate year
