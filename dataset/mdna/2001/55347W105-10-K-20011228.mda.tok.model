total revenues for the supply side business segment in fiscal  which include revenues from the company s ocs subscription fees decreased to million from million in fiscal supply side revenues were million in fiscal in fiscal  total software license revenue decreased from the prior year 
this decline was attributable to the supply side of the business offset by a increase in demand side software license revenues 
the decline in the supply side software license revenues is due to several factors the company transitioned to an asp subscription model for its supply side ocs products and recorded this revenue as services revenues recognized ratably over the contract period  generally one year 
in fiscal  the company successfully penetrated the high end of the supplier e commerce market characterized by a small number of large customers purchasing at a higher price point and recorded these sales as software license sales at the time of shipment 
in fiscal  the company turned its attention to the middle and lower end segments of the supplier market  which includes a large number of smaller companies purchasing at a lower price point  and we experienced a slower rate of adoption and less revenue than fiscal the company recorded million of software catalog content management software licenses in fiscal that were not repeated in fiscal offsetting the decrease in supply side software revenues in fiscal was an increase in demand side software license revenues 
the increase was attributable to several large software licenses in excess of million sold in north america and europe 
the increase in software license revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to increases in supply side software licenses  attributable to the successful penetration of the high end supplier market and million of software catalog content management software licenses concluded in fiscal see above 
the increases in support and services in fiscal and fiscal were attributable to increases in demand side support revenues 
support revenues have increased as a result of sequential increases in the demand side software revenue and a high retention of the existing customer base 
also contributing to the increase in support and services revenues is an increase in demand side service revenues related to large scale implementations of maximo and an increase in supply side data normalization content services

the decrease in the cost of software license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in royalties and software purchased for resale 
also  contributing to the decrease was the purchase of less production materials and documentation  as the company now offers documentation to its customers via its web site 
the decrease of cost of software licenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to decreases of software purchased for resale  offset by an increase in royalties paid to third party vendors 
cost of support and services consists primarily of personnel costs for employees and the related costs of benefits and facilities  costs for utilization of third party consultants  and costs to support the mro operations center 
the increase in cost of support and services in fiscal was attributable to utilization of third party consultants for the demand side business segment and services related to a large supply side contract for software catalog content management services 
the increase in cost of support and services in fiscal was attributable to the hiring of employees for the company s support and services organizations and the use of third party consultants 
the increases in cost of support and services as a percentage of support and services revenues is attributable to higher utilization of third party consultants therefore impacting services margins

the increases in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were due to increases in sales  sales support and marketing personnel  sales commissions  market research  telemarketing expenses and higher travel costs

factors affecting future performance the nature of forward looking information is that such information involves significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
certain public documents of the company and statements made by authorized officers  directors  employees  agents and representatives of the company  acting on its behalf  may include forward looking information which will be influenced by the factors described below  and by other assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
forward looking information is based on assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections regarding the company s future results as well as the future effectiveness of the company s strategic plans and future operational decisions 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company are subject to the risk that the forecasts  projections  and expectations of management  or assumptions underlying such forecasts  projections and expectations  may become inaccurate 
accordingly  actual results and the company s implementation of its plans and operations may differ materially from forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the following discussion identifies certain important factors that could affect the company s actual results and actions and could cause such results and actions to differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
page rapid technological and market changes the computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements by the company and by its competitors 
the company s success depends upon its ability to continue to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  respond to evolving customer requirements and changing industry standards  and achieve market acceptance 
in particular  the company believes that it must continue to respond quickly to users needs for new functionality and to advances in hardware and operating systems  and that it must continue to create products that conform to industry standards regarding the communication and interoperability among software products of different vendors 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and changes in customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could result in a loss of competitiveness and revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements  or that the company will not experience significant delays in its development efforts 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products and product enhancements developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
finally  when the company develops new products or enhances its existing products  it is possible that potential customers will defer or delay their decisions to purchase existing products while the newer products and enhancements are being developed  released and proven in the market 
such delays could have a material  adverse impact on ongoing sales of existing products  and on the company s business and its results of operations 
dependence on maximo a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from the licensing of its maximo family of products and to related services and support 
the company s financial performance depends largely on continued market acceptance of maximo  and the acceptance and market penetration of maximo version  the new internet based version of maximo 
the company believes that continued market acceptance of maximo and revenue growth will largely depend on its ability to continue to enhance and broaden the capabilities of maximo version  both by broadening the core maximo functionality and developing specialized functionality targeted at key vertical industries 
any factor adversely affecting sales of maximo  such as delays in development  significant software flaws  incompatibility with significant hardware platforms  operating systems or databases  increased competition  negative evaluations of maximo or potential customers delay in purchasing in anticipation of new product releases  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations online commerce services market changes in the first quarter of fiscal  the company repositioned its internet based supplier enablement products as mrodistributor  mromanufacturer and mroconnect  offering the suppliers of mro goods and services the ability to manage their internet based e commerce initiatives 
by the end of fiscal  the company had begun to combine these solutions into a single offering known as online commerce services 
there can be no assurance that the company s ocs business will be sold successfully  or that the company s ocs solutions will achieve market acceptance 
there also can be no assurances that the company s maximo customers will influence a meaningful number of their industrial suppliers to adopt our ocs solutions  or that our supplier customers will create a large enough community of sellers  for the company to achieve leverage and market synergy between its maximc and ocs solutions 
the market for business to business e commerce platforms and supporting solutions has experienced significant turmoil and downturn  and there is no clear indication of whether or when this market may re emerge  or the direction that it may take 
as a result  the company cannot predict whether or when products that enable business to business e commerce  marketplaces or exchanges will gain acceptance and be adopted on a repeated or predictable basis 
sales of the company s ocs page solutions will continue to fluctuate until the markets for business to business solutions in general  and for strategic mro e commerce initiatives in particular  stabilize  move and grow in an understandable and predictable direction 
the company s future success in the electronic commerce market may depend on its ability to accurately determine the functionality and features required by its customers  as well as the ability to enhance its ocs solutions and deliver them in a timely manner 
the company may incur substantial costs to enhance and modify its ocs solutions in order to meet the demands of this growing and changing market 
the company s ocs business is not yet profitable  and may not become profitable for some time 
ocs subscription revenue model the company derives revenues from ocs subscription agreements under which customers pay a relatively low monthly or annual fee for the right to use the ocs services 
the ocs offering is delivered via software products that are hosted by the company and accessed by its customers via the internet  and as a result customers do not need to create or maintain extensive internal information systems infrastructure to support the solution 
as a result  the customers cost to discontinue their subscriptions  or to switch to other solutions  would be lower than purchasing a license fee based revenue model 
the use of applications on a hosted basis presents difficulties to customers that they do not face with software that they have licensed internally 
for instance  individual customers might not be able to modify the software to meet their particular needs or request that we perform such modifications 
conversely  the company may implement changes to the software that it believes will meet general market requirements  but which are not desired by certain customers 
in the event that any of the foregoing difficulties are experienced by a material number of ocs customers  it would be easy for those customers to discontinue their subscriptions  which could cause a material  adverse impact on the company s ocs revenue  and on the company s overall results of operations 
catalog management product recently developed the company s collego catalog manager ccm product was recently acquired from collego corporation  and is being made generally available to customers during fiscal as with any new product  there can be no assurance that the new product will meet the needs of its targeted market  either in terms of desired functionality  performance or quality 
in addition  many features of this product are being added to our on line commerce services offerings 
as a result  delays  deficiencies or difficulties with the ongoing development and release of collego catalog manager and its component feature set could have a material  adverse impact on revenues from both ccm and ocs 
the company will continue to develop ccm throughout the year  by adding functionality  porting the product to additional platforms and operating environments  and translating and localizing the product to meet the requirements of additional geographies 
difficulties or delays in developing and releasing ccm as planned throughout the year could have material  adverse impact on the revenues derived by the company from its ccm and ocs operations 
dependence on sales channels and business alliances in order for the company to maintain and grow its revenues  the company is both dependent upon its existing distribution channels  and it must develop new channels 
the company cannot control the actions of its distributors  resellers  agents and other channel partners  and if these companies suffer business downturns or fail to meet their objectives  the company s revenues and results of operations will suffer as a result 
with respect to its ocs business in particular  the company will seek to develop new channels  including e commerce marketplaces or exchanges that use the company s ocs solutions 
the ability of these marketplaces or exchanges to page generate such fees for the company will depend to a large degree on the validity of their underlying business models  the vibrancy of their various markets and various other factors specific to their businesses  including the general market acceptance and growth of e commerce marketplaces and exchanges 
the company has entered into strategic partnerships with various larger companies  such as i  ariba  inc  rockwell automation  and others 
the company s ability to generate incremental revenue through these partnerships will depend upon the company s ability to integrate its products and solutions with those of the other companies  its ability to coordinate and support each company s sales and marketing efforts  and the degree and nature of the sales and marketing efforts made by each company 
in particular  the company has integrated certain of its products with certain products offered by i  and the two companies may experience difficulties in gaining market acceptance of the integrated products both within the i sales force and the marketplace in general  and difficulties in integrating and coordinating the company s products and sales efforts with the products and sales efforts of i finally  competitive alliances may emerge among other companies that adversely affect customers interests in our strategic partnerships 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  seasonality the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results  which may negatively impact the price of our stock 
the company believes that these quarterly fluctuations are partly attributable to the company s sales commission policies  which compensate members of the company s direct sales force for meeting or exceeding annual quotas 
in addition  the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated historically due to the number and timing of product introductions and enhancements  customers delaying their purchasing decisions in anticipation of new product releases  the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers  the timing of product shipments and the timing of marketing and product development expenditures 
the company typically realizes a significant portion of its revenue from sales of software licenses in the last two weeks of a quarter  frequently even in the last days of a quarter 
failure to close a small number of large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
competition the market for enterprise asset maintenance software such as maximo is fragmented by geography  by hardware platform and by industry orientation  and is characterized by a large number of competitors including both independent software vendors and certain enterprise resource planning erp vendors 
independent software vendors include datastream and indus 
maximo also competes with integrated erp systems which include integrated maintenance modules offered by several large vendors  such as sap  oracle and jd edwards and others 
currently  maximo competes with products of a number of large vendors  some of which have traditionally provided maintenance software running on mainframes and minicomputers and are now offering systems for use in the client server environment 
maximo also encounters competition from vendors of low cost maintenance management systems designed initially for use by a single user or limited number of users as vendors of these products upgrade their functionality to enter the client server market 
some of the companies mentioned above have also developed e procurement applications that are competitive with maximo buyer  and e commerce platforms and supply chain integration solutions that are competitive with the company s ocs solutions 
the company s ocs business has many diverse competitors offering a wide range of differing products  services and technologies 
the company expects competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
we may not remain competitive  and increased competition could seriously harm our business 
our competitors offer a variety of e business products that compete with ours 
we may compete with vendors who have established electronic marketplaces and indirect procurement capabilities  such as ariba and commerce one 
page other competitive factors include internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments and companies offering customized products 
certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technological resources than the company 
to the extent that such competitors increase their focus on the asset maintenance or planning and cost systems markets  or on the industrial supply chain market  the company could be at a competitive disadvantage 
international operations a significant portion of the company s total revenues is derived from operations outside the united states 
our ability to sell our products internationally is subject to a number of risks 
general economic and political conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
exposure to currency fluctuations and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable could affect our sales 
we could be affected by the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign import laws  united states export laws and regulatory requirements 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market  and increase our operating costs 
dependence on third parties the company has entered into nonexclusive license agreements with other software vendors  pursuant to which the company incorporates into its products software providing certain application development  user interface  business intelligence  content and graphics capabilities developed by these companies 
if the company were unable to renew these licenses or unable to renew them on commercially reasonable terms  or if any of such vendors were to become unable to support and enhance its products  the company could be required to devote additional resources to the enhancement and support of these products or to acquire or develop software providing equivalent capabilities  which could cause delays in the development and introduction of products incorporating such capabilities 
our mro operations center is dependent on digital island  a third party data center  which could be destroyed or damaged 
the company must stay on good terms with this vendor  and be able to renew its agreement with this vendor on commercially reasonably terms 
if this data center were to become inoperable or unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  the company would incur significant expense  and potentially lose its ability to provide these services altogether during the period of downtime and transition  resulting in customer dissatisfaction and market rejection of its ocs solutions 
the company s ocs operations are dependent upon the company s ability to protect computer equipment and the information stored in these third party data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disasters  fire  power loss  telecommunication or internet failures  unauthorized intrusions  computer viruses and other similar damaging events 
the company cannot assure that any of these damaging events would not result in a prolonged outage of the company s network services or that the company would not experience a reduction of revenues or unexpected expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
hosting the company does not have extensive experience in hosting applications  and the hosting industry is relatively young 
if we do not accurately predict the volume of traffic  or if we encounter technical difficulties with our software or our infrastructure  we may experience slower response times or other problems 
any delays in response time or performance problems could cause our customers to perceive this service as not functioning properly and they may discontinue use of our products and services 
the company s success and profitability in its ocs business is dependent on the company s ability to increase the scalability and performance of its ocs solutions  meaning that the company must be able to host and operate a large number of online commerce service product instances on a single computer using multiple processors 
this is because the company incurs fixed costs associated with the hosting environment  regardless of how many  or how few  ocs products are page hosted at the same time 
if the company is unable to host a certain number of ocs product instances per computer  then the ocs business may not become profitable for a long time 
moreover  if the company is not able to operate a large number of ocs product instances on the same computer without degrading product performance  the ocs solutions may not gain customer acceptance and market penetration 
product development internet the company recently released maximo version  which is entirely based upon java and other technologies emerging and recently adopted in conjunction with the internet 
new internet technologies and applications are developing rapidly and are continuously being introduced  competing for acceptance in the market  and changing 
mro supply chain management using electronic commerce is a nascent market with many standards and technologies either competing for acceptance or remaining to be developed 
accordingly  for the company s ocs offerings to be successful  the company must accurately predict and successfully implement those standards and technologies that ultimately gain long term acceptance in the market 
the company believes that electronic commerce products and technologies complement the company s enterprise asset management products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully anticipate trends in this market  that the company will be successful in internet technology development or acquisition efforts or that the company s internet applications  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
product development acquisitions the company may from time to time purchase software products or technologies from other companies  or as part of the company s acquisition of other companies 
while the company exercises due diligence in determining whether acquired products or technologies are suitable and of commercial quality  there can be no assurances that the new products or technologies will meet the company s expectations  that the company will be able to employ and retain the personnel necessary for the company to effectively exploit the new products or technologies  that the company will be able to successfully integrate the new products or technologies with or into the company s existing products and product architecture  that the company will be able to effectively distribute the new products or technologies through its existing sales force and channels  that the company will be able to retain existing customers and revenue streams that may have been associated with the new products or technologies prior to their acquisition by the company  or that such existing customers may not demand that the company remedy problems that were not known or disclosed at the time of the acquisition 
as a result of the foregoing  the company may not realize the benefits intended from such acquisitions or recover its investments  which would have a material adverse impact on the company s business and its results of operations 
limited intellectual property protection the company s success is dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company currently has one united states patent and one patent pending within the us and corresponding applications pending in various foreign countries  and protects its technology primarily through copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements 
the company s software products are sometimes licensed to customers under shrink wrap or click wrap licenses included as part of the product packaging or acknowledged by customers who register on line 
although  in larger sales  the company s shrink wrap and click wrap licenses may be accompanied by specifically negotiated agreements signed by the licensee  in many cases its shrink wrap and click wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees 
certain provisions of the company s shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  including provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or development by others of similar technology 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any valid claim of any patent or any other proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that page third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  could result in the deterioration or outright loss of the company s patent rights  copyrights or other intellectual property  and could potentially have a material adverse result on our operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent on certain key executive officers  technical and sales employees  and the loss of one or more of such employees could have an adverse impact on the future operations of the company 
the company does not have employment contracts with  and does not maintain any so called key person life insurance policies on  any personnel 
the company continues to hire a significant number of additional sales  services and technical personnel 
competition for hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and the company from time to time experiences difficulty in locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications within the desired geographic locations  or with certain industry specific domain expertise 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
possible continued volatility of stock price and economic conditions there have recently been significant fluctuations in the market price of the common stock  par value 
per share  of the company the common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software and e commerce companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  general macro economic and market conditions unrelated to our performance may also affect demand for our products and services  our results of operations  and our stock price 
other risk factors the foregoing is not a complete description of all risk factors relevant to the company s future performance  and the foregoing should be read and understood together with and in the context of similar discussions which may be contained in the documents that the company files with the sec in the future 
however  the company undertakes no obligation to update the foregoing 
no revisions or updates to forward looking statements the company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision or update to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on its cash equivalents and marketable securities and exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at september   the company held million in cash equivalents and marketable securities consisting of taxable and tax exempt municipal securities
