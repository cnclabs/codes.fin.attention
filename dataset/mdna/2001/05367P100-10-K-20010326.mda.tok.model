item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  markets  sells and supports a wide range of software and systems for digital media production  management and distribution 
digital media are media elements  whether video or audio or graphics  in which the image  sound or picture is recorded and stored as digital values  as opposed to analog  or tape based  signals 
in august  we acquired the business of softimage inc softimage 
the acquisition was recorded as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of softimage are included in our financial statements as of the acquisition date 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced and implemented a restructuring plan to strategically refocus our business and bring operating expenses in line with net revenues  with the goal of restoring long term profitability to the company 
the process included a re evaluation of our core competencies  technology plan  and business model  and was completed in tandem with the development of our fiscal operating plan 
the restructuring plan resulted in a charge of approximately million related to the termination of employees  or of our workforce  and the vacating of certain facilities  as well as the discontinuation of a limited number of products 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative restructuring and other costs amortization of acquisition related intangible assets total operating expenses operating loss other income and expense  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss excluding amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and  in and  restructuring and other costs  pro forma operating income loss was  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
net revenues our net revenues have been derived mainly from the sales of computer based digital  nonlinear media editing systems and related peripherals  licensing of related software  and sales of related software maintenance contracts 
net revenues increased from million in to in net revenues decreased to million in from million in the increase in net revenues during was attributable primarily to digidesign audio products which had a revenue increase of million year over year 
this increase at digidesign was primarily attributable to the digi product  which was introduced in late  and distribution of third party audio related and pro tools compatible products 
other products that contributed to the overall increase were media composer upgrades and a full year of sales of avid unity medianet  introduced in mid  avid xpress dv  introduced in early  and trilligent cluster  introduced in mid these increases were offset by reductions in sales of media composer systems  local storage  symphony systems  and service revenues 
the decrease in net revenues during was attributable to several product families  including media composer  avid xpress  broadcast products  customer service  graphics and effects  and local storage products 
these declines were partially offset by increases in sales of avid symphony  which was introduced in late  avid unity medianet  softimage ds  softimage d and digidesign products 
there was also a significant decrease in macintosh based unit sales in which was only partially offset by the introduction of windows nt based products 
during  we began shipping several new products and version updates of existing products  including avid xpress dv on ibm intellistation for the windows nt platform  softimage xsi  avid symphony  media composer  trilligent cluster  avid epublisher  avid unity for news  newscutter effects v  airspace  videospace and hyperspace 
during  we introduced two new products  avid unity medianet and digi additionally  in  we introduced several version updates of existing products  including media composer for the windows nt platform  media composer xl for the macintosh platform  avid xpress for the windows nt platform  avid xpress for the macintosh platform  avid newscutter  avid symphony  avid unity medianet  softimage ds  pro tools and pro tools le for the windows nt platform  softimage d sp and media illusion net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for  compared to of net revenue for and of net revenue for international sales sales to customers outside the united states and canada accounted for of our net revenues  compared to for and for international sales increased by approximately million or in compared to and decreased by approximately million or in compared to the increase in international sales for compared to reflected increases in the asia pacific region primarily and  to a lesser extent  latin america  partially offset by decreases in europe 
the slight decrease in international sales for compared to reflected decreases in europe and latin america  partially offset by increases in the asia pacific region 
gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  test  and distribution of finished products  warehousing  post sales customer support costs  and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
the resulting gross profit fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  and sales of aftermarket hardware products 
gross margin decreased to in compared to in  which had decreased from in the decrease during reflects the impact of currency fluctuations  primarily a weakening of the euro resulting in lower us dollar equivalent revenue  a shift to lower margin products and upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  offset by efficiencies in manufacturing 
the decrease during was primarily due to price reductions in certain product lines  as well as to discounting and promotions offered 
in addition  there was a shift in mix to lower margin product families and lower priced models within product families 
research and development research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to and increased by  or  in as compared to the decrease in expenditures in was primarily the result of restructuring actions implemented in late spending reductions were realized in personnel and occupancy costs which were offset by investments in several new initiatives  including avid internet solutions ais  a newly created division offering a turnkey media system optimized to deliver high bandwith content over the internet  avidpronet apn and the broadcast business  as well as the digidesign audio business and lower end products such as avid xpress dv 
the increase in expenditures in was primarily due to a full twelve months of softimage costs compared to five months of costs in  as well as the creation of a new engineering department to develop avid unity medianet  partially offset by reductions in other personnel related expenditures and in discretionary spending 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in primarily due to our restructuring actions  coupled with an increased revenue base in research and development expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in primarily due to the lower annual revenue in marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to and increased by million  or  in compared to the decrease in expenditures in was primarily the result of restructuring actions implemented in late spending reductions were realized in personnel  occupancy and marketing related costs 
these reductions were slightly offset by investments in several new initiatives  most notably ais 
the increased expenditures in were primarily due to a full twelve months of softimage costs compared to five months of costs in  as well as significant increased expenditures in the professional audio business related to new product launches during the year 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in personnel related expenditures in our video and film editing and effects business 
marketing and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in primarily due to the aforementioned restructuring actions  coupled with an increased revenue base in marketing and selling expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in primarily due to the lower annual revenue in general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to and decreased by approximately million  or  in compared to the decrease in expenses in primarily represents reduced personnel related costs related to restructuring actions implemented in late  consulting fees  legal fees and travel 
these reductions were partially offset by executive severance benefits  profit sharing expense and retention programs 
the decrease in expenses in was primarily related to personnel related costs  partially offset by a full twelve months of softimage costs in compared to five months of costs in general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in and from in the percentage decrease in was related to reduced spending due to the restructuring actions and an increased revenue base  the increase in percentage of net revenues in was primarily due to lower annual revenues 
restructuring and other costs during the fourth quarter of  we incurred and recorded a million restructuring charge  a charge of million related to the sale of our italian subsidiary and a charge of million related to contractually obligated employment costs for executive officers who resigned from the company 
during  we incurred other charges of million relating to in process research and development in connection with the august acquisition of the business of softimage 
in december  we announced and implemented a restructuring plan to strategically refocus the company and bring operating expenses in line with net revenues  with the goal of restoring long term profitability and supporting our new strategic initiatives 
the process included a re evaluation of our core competencies  technology plans and business model  and was completed in tandem with development of our fiscal operating plan 
the major elements of the restructuring plan included the termination of certain employees and the vacating of certain facilities 
the plan also provided for no further releases of a limited number of existing product offerings  including stand alone marquee  avid cinema  media illusion and matador 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the charge included approximately million for severance and related costs for employees on a worldwide basis  million for facility vacancy costs and approximately million of non cash charges relating to the disposition of certain fixed assets that would no longer be used 
at the time of the charge  the company expected that these restructuring actions would result in an expense reduction of approximately million on an annualized basis 
during  we made cash payments of million  of which million was related to personnel costs and million was facilities related 
during  we made cash payments of million related to these restructuring activities 
the remaining accrual balance at december  was million  the majority of which relates to estimated losses on office space in the united kingdom which we vacated and sublet 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our italian subsidiary to a third party  which established the entity as a distributor of avid products 
the sale was completed in the first quarter of we incurred and recorded a loss of approximately million relating to the sale  including a reserve of million for our guarantee of the new entity s line of credit with a bank which ended january  the sale of the subsidiary was done to reduce our operating expenses  while maintaining a productive and profitable presence in the italian marketplace 
in december  in connection with the resignation of two executive officers  we incurred and recorded a charge of million for termination benefits as specified in the employment contracts of the officers 
to date  cash payments of approximately million have been made and  at december   the related accrual was approximately million 
this remaining obligation is expected to be paid in in connection with the august acquisition of the business of softimage  we allocated million to in process research and development 
in process research and development represents development projects in areas that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
accordingly  million was expensed as of the acquisition date and was reflected as a special charge to operations in the amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development were based on results of an independent appraisal 
the values of in process research and development were determined using a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
in process research and development projects identified at the acquisition date included next generation three dimensional modeling  animation and rendering software  and new graphic  film and media management capabilities for effects intensive  on line finishing applications for editing 
a description of each project follows o next generation three dimensional modeling  animation and rendering software 
the efforts required to develop this project into a commercially viable product principally relate to completion of the animation and real time playback architecture  completion and integration of architectural software components  validation of the resulting architecture  and finalization of the initial feature set 
as of the acquisition date  we had assessed that the overall project was complete and calculated a value of million for this in process research and development 
the estimated costs to complete this project as of the acquisition date were million 
we actually incurred approximately million on this project through may  at which time the product  softimage xsi  was released 
total development costs to complete this project were higher than originally anticipated due to challenges encountered in the development process which caused a significant delay in the release of the product 
o new graphics  film and media management capabilities for effects intensive  on line finishing 
the efforts required to develop this project into a commercially viable product related principally to the rebuilding of the framework architecture  the rewriting of software code of the compositing engine to accommodate significant new features  and the rewriting of software code of the titling component 
as of the acquisition date  we had assessed that the overall project was complete and calculated a value of million for this in process research and development 
the estimated costs to complete this project as of the acquisition date were million 
the project was completed in december at a cost of approximately million 
development costs were higher than originally anticipated due to the addition of features and functionality  which expanded the scope of the original project 
the value of in process research and development  specifically  was determined by estimating the costs to develop the in process projects into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  discounting the net cash flows back to their present values  and adjusting that result to reflect each project s stage of completion 
the expected cash flows of the in process projects were adjusted to reflect the contribution of completed and core technologies 
at the time of acquisition  total revenues from these in process projects were forecasted to peak in and then to decline from to as new products were expected to be introduced by the company 
these revenue forecasts were based on management s estimate of market size and growth  expected trends in technology  and the expected timing of new product introductions 
a discount rate of was used for valuing the in process research and development 
the discount rate was higher than our implied weighted average cost of capital due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development and the related risk of realizing cash flows from products that have not yet reached technological feasibility  among other factors 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in connection with the august acquisition of the business of softimage  we allocated million to goodwill and million to intangible assets consisting of completed technologies  workforce  and trade name 
included in the operating results for  and is amortization of these intangible assets and goodwill of million  million  and million  respectively 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
during  a balance sheet purchase accounting adjustment was recorded which decreased goodwill by approximately million 
the balance of the intangible assets  including goodwill  was million at december  the remaining million is expected to be amortized through july the amounts allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets were based on results of an independent appraisal 
the values of completed technologies were determined using a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
as of the acquisition date  total revenues from the completed technologies were forecasted to peak in and to decline through the company discounted the net cash flows of the completed technologies to their present value using a discount rate of 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  consists of interest income  interest expense and  in  equity in income of non consolidated companies 
during  other income and expense  net  increased to million from million in the increase was primarily related to an increase in income related to non consolidated companies which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense 
other income and expense  net  of million for decreased approximately million from due to reduced interest income from reduced cash and investment balances during the period 
provision for benefit from income taxes our effective tax rate was   and  respectively  for   and the tax rate for includes an addition to the valuation allowance against all us related deferred tax assets and the establishment of a valuation allowance against a majority of the foreign deferred tax assets 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us and foreign taxable income  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the establishment of a valuation allowance 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to state taxes  the us federal research tax credit and our foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed at different rates 
the tax rate for includes the impact of establishing a full valuation allowance against us related deferred tax assets 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to state taxes and the us federal research tax credit 
the tax rate for includes a benefit of million related to the pre tax charge of for in process technology associated with our acquisition of softimage 
at that time  a portion of the charge was not deductible for us federal tax purposes 
excluding the charge and related tax benefit  our effective tax rate would have been for the effective tax rate excluding the charge and related tax benefit of is different from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to our foreign subsidiaries  which were taxed in the aggregate at a lower rate  and the us federal research tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date through both private and public sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
with respect to cash flow  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in during  cash generated from operating activities reflects net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization and provision for doubtful accounts  offset by cash uses attributable primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
during  net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization and changes in deferred taxes  as well as decreases in accounts receivable 
this was offset by reductions in income taxes payable and accrued expenses 
during  net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization and the charge for in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of softimage 
we purchased million of property and equipment during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
purchases in were primarily of equipment to support research and development activities 
purchases in were primarily of hardware and software for our information systems and equipment to support research and development activities 
during  we also made a cash investment of million in rocket network  inc and purchased the assets of two companies  pluto and tmf  for a total of approximately million in cash and million of guaranteed bonuses to be paid in we also utilized cash of million in our acquisition of softimage in additionally  we made a payment of million in against a note issued to microsoft corporation in connection with the acquisition of softimage 
the remaining principal balance of the note of approximately million is due and payable in june see note f to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the acquisitions of pluto and tmf  we may be required to make certain contingent cash payments limited in the aggregate to an additional million  dependent upon future revenues and or gross margin levels of products acquired from these companies through december during  we generated cash of approximately million  net of common stock repurchases  from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we used approximately million for financing activities reflecting the acquisition of million of treasury stock  which was offset by the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
during  we used approximately million for financing activities reflecting primarily treasury stock purchases net of stock option exercise proceeds 
during  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
purchases have been and will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
we have used  and plan to continue to use  any repurchased shares for reissuance under our employee stock plans 
during  we repurchased approximately million additional shares of common stock at a cost of million 
during  we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock at a cost of million 
as of december   there were approximately  shares remaining authorized for repurchase 
these shares were repurchased in the open market in the first quarter of at a cost of million 
we believe existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
in the event we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so  or that we could do so on favorable terms 
european monetary union on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies and the euro 
as of that date  the participating countries agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency 
however  the legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries until january  during this transition period  public and private parties may elect to pay or charge for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency 
we began conducting certain business transactions in the euro on january   and changed our functional currency for the effected countries to the euro on january  the conversion to the euro has not had and is not expected to have a significant operational impact or a material financial impact on the results of operations  financial position  or liquidity of our european businesses 
new accounting pronouncements in june and  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards nos 
and sfas and sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas clarifies certain provisions of sfas  and sfas defers the implementation of sfas by one year 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after january   and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standard board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas revises the standards of accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  and reiterates many of the provisions of sfas sfas is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  sfas is effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for our fiscal year ending december  we do not expect the application of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results some of the statements in this form k relating to our future performance  constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations and involve known and unknown risks 
realization of any of these risks may cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements 
certain of these risks are as follows our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products in the digital editing market 
our core digital video and film editing market predominantly uses avid products  particularly media composer  which represents a significant portion of our revenues  and future growth in this market could be limited 
our future growth will depend upon our ability to introduce new features and functionality for media composer  improve upon its price performance  respond to competitive offerings  and adapt to new industry requirements and standards 
any delay or failure to further develop media composer or to introduce other new products in this market  could harm our business and reduce our operating results 
broadcast market is large  widely dispersed  and highly competitive  and we may not be successful in growing our customer base in this market 
we are currently building our presence in the broadcast market and have augmented our newscutter offering with the unity for news products  launched in december  and with the server  newsroom  and browser products obtained in the recent pluto and inews acquisitions 
as a relatively new player in the broadcast market  we may encounter difficulties in establishing ourselves and developing a strong  loyal customer base 
our competitors  such as associated press  sony  panasonic  and grass valley  may devote greater resources to the broadcast market than we do  or may be able to leverage their market presence more effectively 
if we are unsuccessful in capturing a share of the market  our business and revenues could be adversely affected 
competition in the d animation market has increased dramatically since our acquisition of softimage 
the animation market has changed significantly from the time when we acquired our softimage subsidiary in august while softimage once dominated the higher end of the d market ie  feature films and other intensive graphics applications  it now faces new challenges to its products and services 
competitors products  including alias wavefront s maya  discreet s d studio max  and newtech s lightwave  have reduced softimage s market share 
in addition  new product offerings from all of the market players in recent years have contributed to downward price pressure  which has resulted in increasing compression of margins 
to the extent that these factors continue or worsen  our business may suffer 
we have a significant share of the professional audio market and therefore growth in this market could be limited 
currently  our digidesign division maintains a significant portion of the professional audio market 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  new audio products and enhancements of our existing audio products 
the timely development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process  and we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing  and other difficulties that delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements 
we are expanding our product line  and our future revenues depend on their success 
we are expanding our product line beyond our core video editing market to address the digital media production needs of the broadcast news market  including cable and internet news  on line film and video finishing market  and the emerging market for multimedia production tools  including the internet and corporate markets 
we have limited experience in serving these markets  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop such products successfully 
to be successful  we will need to introduce new products  gain customer acceptance  and establish appropriate distribution and support channels 
any unexpected delays or additional costs that we incur in achieving these goals could harm our business and reduce our operating results 
our future growth depends in part on the widespread adoption of the internet by the digital media market 
our plans for future growth in the internet market  including the avid production network and trilligent product lines  as well as the internet news market  depend on increased use of the internet for the creation  use  manipulation  and distribution of media content from corporate markets to high end post production 
such uses of the internet are currently at an early stage of development  and the future evolution of the internet market is not clear 
our success in this emerging internet market will depend on the rate at which the market develops and on our ability to establish our market presence 
if the commercial use of the internet fails to grow as anticipated or if we are unable to capture a significant market share  our business and results of operations could suffer 
our products are complex and delays or difficulties in introducing new products could harm our business 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer products that compete favorably with our competitors products in terms of reliability  performance  ease of use  range of features  product enhancements  reputation  price  and training 
delays or difficulties in product development and introduction may harm our business 
our products are internally complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
such errors or defects could cause us to issue corrective releases and could result in loss of revenues  increased product returns  lack of market acceptance  and damage to our reputation 
new product announcements by our competitors and by us could have the effect of reducing customer demand for our existing products 
some of our new products constitute upgrades of existing products 
in the past  we have offered discounts on the price of such upgrades to existing customers  which  where appropriate  have been based upon the return of circuit boards and system keys 
to the extent that such circuit boards and system keys are not returned  it can decrease the revenue generated by such new products 
new product introductions require us to devote time and resources to training our sales channels in product features and target customers  with the temporary result that the sales channels have less time to devote to selling our products 
qualifying and supporting our products on both windows and macintosh platforms  as well as other computer systems  is time consuming and expensive 
our software engineers devote significant time and effort to qualify and support our products on various computer platforms  including most notably  windows nt and macintosh 
computer platform modifications and upgrades require additional time to be spent to ensure that our products will function properly 
to the extent that the current configuration of the qualified and supported platforms change or that we need to qualify and support new platforms  we may be required to expend valuable engineering resources and thereby reduce our profit margins 
our operating results are dependent on several unpredictable factors 
our gross profit margin on our products depends on many factors 
such factors include o mix of products sold  o cost and the proportion of third party hardware included in such products  o product distribution channels  o timing of new product introductions  o product offers and platform upgrades  o price discounts and sales promotion programs  o volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  o costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with defects  o provisions for inventory obsolescence  o allocations of manufacturing overhead and customer support costs to cost of goods  o sales of third party computer hardware to distributors  o competitive pressure on product prices  and o currency fluctuations 
negative changes to any of these factors could reduce our gross profit margin 
our operating costs are tied to projections of future revenues  which may differ from actual results 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenues 
such future revenues are difficult to predict 
further  we are generally unable to reduce quarterly operating expense levels rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations upon which expense levels are based  our results of operations could be lower than we had anticipated 
the markets for our products are competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the digital video  audio and animation markets are competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new products 
our key competitors are identified above under competition in item many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  support  and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which we could not operate profitably 
further  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to ours  or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
if we are unable to compete effectively in our target markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
we depend on a number of sole source suppliers 
we are dependent on a number of specific suppliers for certain key components of our products 
these components include o video compression chips manufactured by c cube microsystems  o a small computer systems interface scsi accelerator board from atto technology  o a d digital video effects board from pinnacle systems  o application specific integrated circuits asics from chip express and lsi logic  o digital signal processing integrated circuits from motorola  o a fibre channeln adapter card from jni  o a fibre channel storage array from the clariion division of emc  o a pci expansion chassis from sbs technologies  inc  o a fixed programmable gate array from quicklogic  o digital to analog and analog to digital converter integrated circuits from cirrus logic  o a peripheral component interconnect bridge integrated circuits from intel corp  and o analog switches and op amps from analog devices 
we purchase these sole source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
we generally do not carry significant inventories of these sole source components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements 
if any of these sole source vendors failed to supply or enhance such components  it could imperil our supply of these components 
similarly  if any such vendor encountered technical  operating or financial difficulties  it might threaten our supply of these components 
while we believe that alternative sources of supply for sole source components could be developed  or our products redesigned to permit the use of alternative components  an interruption in our sources of supply could damage our business and negatively affect our operating results 
if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our resellers  distributors  and component suppliers  our ability to successfully deploy our products may be harmed 
we sell many of our products and services indirectly through resellers and distributors 
these resellers and distributors typically purchase software and kits from us and other turnkey components from other vendors in order to produce complete systems for resale 
any disruption to our resellers and distributors  or their third party suppliers  could reduce our gross profit margin 
if we become dependent on third party hardware for our products  our operating results could be harmed 
our gross profit margin varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
from time to time  we add functionality and features to our products 
if we effect such additions through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and do not increase the price of such products to offset these increased costs  then our gross profit margin on these products could decrease 
our future growth could be harmed if we lost the services of our key personnel 
our success depends upon the services of a number of key current employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could harm our business 
our success also depends upon our ability to attract highly skilled new employees 
competition for such employees is intense in the industries and geographic areas in which we operate 
if we are unable to compete successfully for such employees  our business could suffer 
our avidpronet 
com website could subject us to legal claims that could harm our business 
we have launched the avid production network site avidpronet 
com to provide interactive information and services to new media and post production professionals 
our plans for avidpronet 
com include content hosting  remote reviewing  and stock footage availability 
because materials may be posted on and or downloaded from the avidpronet 
com website and distributed to others  we may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  or other theories of liability based on the nature  content  publication and distribution of such materials 
in addition  although we have attempted to limit our exposure by contract  we may also be subject to claims for indemnification by end users in the event that the security of the avidpronet 
com website is compromised 
as the website is available on a worldwide basis  the website could potentially be subject to a wide variety of international laws 
regulations could be enacted that restrict our internet initiatives and result in slowing our future growth 
as a result of the increasing use and popularity of the internet  federal  state  and local authorities may adopt new laws and regulations governing the internet 
these laws and regulations may cover issues such as privacy  distribution  and content 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations could impede the growth of the internet  harm our internet initiatives  and place additional financial burdens on our business 
we could incur substantial costs protecting our intellectual property or defending against a claim of infringement 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws  trade secret  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology  unauthorized persons  from time to time  have obtained  copied  and used information that we consider proprietary 
policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology is costly and time consuming and may be inadequate to protect us fully 
we occasionally receive communications suggesting that our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
it is our practice to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products or relating to current or future technologies  we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or unable to negotiate licenses for the use of others intellectual property  our business would be impaired 
we are currently involved in various legal proceedings  including patent litigation 
an adverse resolution of any such proceedings could harm our business and reduce our results of operations 
see item legal proceedings above 
if we acquire other companies or businesses  we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business 
we periodically acquire businesses  form strategic alliances  or make debt or equity investments 
the risks associated with such acquisitions  alliances  and investments include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the target companies  the failure to realize anticipated return on investment  cost savings and synergies  and the diversion of management s time and attention 
such acquisitions  alliances  and investments often involve significant transaction related costs and cause short term disruption to normal operations 
if we are unable to overcome or counter these risks  it could undermine our business and lower our operating results 
our operating results could be harmed by currency fluctuations 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar could lower future revenues and operating results 
strikes by actors or writers could harm our revenues 
as reported in the press  the guilds and unions that represent actors and writers in the film and television industries periodically threaten to strike 
if such a strike were to occur  it could slow down or even stop production at major film and television studios 
if such a strike were to last for a significant amount of time  the demand for our products could be reduced and our revenues could decline 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the recent past and could fluctuate substantially in the future based upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o changes in our quarterly operating results  o shortfalls in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  o changes in analysts recommendations or projections  o fluctuations in investors perceptions of us or our competitors  o shifts in the markets for our products  o development and marketing of products by our competitors  and o changes in our relationships with suppliers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  or customers 
further  the stock market has witnessed unusual volatility with respect to the price of equity securities of high technology companies generally  and this volatility has  at times  appeared to be unrelated to any of the factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk our primary exposures to market risk are the effect of volatility in currencies on asset and liability positions of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies and the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
foreign currency exchange risk we derive greater than of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
this circumstance exposes us to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can impact revenues  net income loss and cash flow 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on the contracts are recorded in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had million of forward exchange contracts outstanding  denominated in various european and asian currencies and the canadian and australian dollar  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
net losses of million resulting from forward exchange contracts were included in the results of operations in  which more than offset net gains on the related asset and liabilities of million 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term government and government agency obligations 
cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
