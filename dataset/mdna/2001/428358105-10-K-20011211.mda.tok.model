table of contents industry background the need for a more effective use of and efficient communication utilizing the public network infrastructure in a business environment is one of the main drivers of the extensive deployment of network based communications systems 
the resulting increase in connectivity has further driven the need for technology that safeguards and manages the access to information available over these expanding global networks 
the network computing market has undergone three major transitions over the past decade and it is the convergence of these transitions that contributed to the recent increase in global connectivity 
the first of these transitions was the migration of corporate computing environments from centralized mainframe systems to distributed client server environments 
the ability to access and share information through client server technology expanded the need for connectivity beyond workgroup local area networks lans to enterprise wide networks spanning multiple lans and wide area networks wans 
the second major transition was the widespread adoption of the internet for business to business communications 
internet based business applications have expanded beyond e mail to a broad range of business applications and services including electronic publishing  direct to customer transactions  product marketing  advertising and customer support 
the last of these transitions was the emergence of consumer to business or e commerce communications 
the convergence of these major transitions led to the need for secure  managed communications and the emergence of virtual private networks that use the public internet infrastructure and associated protocols and applications to share information and services both within the enterprise and with business partners and customers 
as a result  businesses are able to share internal information and run enterprise applications across geographically dispersed facilities as well as enable customers  suppliers and other business partners to inexpensively link into their enterprise information systems 
as internet protocols and infrastructure gain increasing and widespread acceptance for global communication  new wide area connectivity services such as database access  transaction processing services  audio and telephone services as well as video teleconferencing services are emerging at a rapid rate 
this expansion of services and applications is further accelerating the use of networks as global communication systems 
the emergence of e business increased the challenges in enabling secure access to information and applications 
the complexity of and need for network security driven to provide the tremendous benefits of connectivity and information exchange  organizations potentially expose sensitive information and mission critical applications to unauthorized access  both through connections to the public internet and from within the enterprise 
in addition  transmission of data over the internet may also expose such data to unauthorized interception 
these risks create a critical need for enterprises to protect their information and information systems from unauthorized access and use 
historical methods for securing information resources are no longer adequate to meet the security requirements of today s global networks 
today s distributed network environments provide multiple points of access and multiple network resources  making it impractical to individually secure every application and resource on the network 
therefore  additional layers of security at the network level are required to control access to the network and to regulate and protect the flow of data between network segments 
the increasing demands placed on data communication security systems by the expansion of internet services and global enterprise networking is quickly outpacing the capabilities of many traditional internet security appliance architectures 
these demands include the need to define and transparently enforce an integrated  enterprise wide security policy that can be managed centrally and implemented on a distributed basis 
an effective network security solution also needs to be open and extensible to enable it to address the rapidly changing requirements of the internet and intranets  including the addition of new security applications  such as authentication  encryption  url filtering  anti virus protection  and java and activex security services and functions 
this increased complexity  along with the higher demand placed by ever increasing bandwidths and the increasing number of users has driven the creation of data communications semiconductors specifically designed for the security task 
these high performance security integrated circuits create the next generation security platform for the internet based on a combination of protocol features  customer 
table of contents complex core logic and standards based buses and interfaces 
this is at the core of hifn s security network processor products 
the hifn solution hifn is a flow classification and network security specialist company supplying most major network equipment vendors with patented technology to improve network packet processing 
we design  develop and market high performance  multi protocol packet processors semiconductor devices and software designed to enable secure  high bandwidth network connectivity  comprehensive differentiation of business critical application network traffic from other general purpose network traffic and efficient compression  encryption compression and public key cryptography  providing our customers with high performance  interoperable implementations of a wide variety of industry standard networking and storage protocols 
we believe that our patented compression technology comprises the fundamental know how for the design and implementation of low cost  high performance implementations of lossless data compression and gives our products a strong competitive advantage 
by offering a wide range of high performance implementations of our patented  standards compliant technology  we are able to sell products to network and storage equipment vendors that allow them to reduce development costs and get their products to market faster 
our patented lempel ziv stac compression technology lzs is incorporated into several networking protocol standards  including point to point protocol ppp and the frame relay protocol  allowing network equipment vendors to rapidly integrate proven solutions for mitigating the costs associated with traditional private leased line network architectures 
the microsoft point to point compression mppc implementation of our patents  developed by microsoft  is incorporated into the ppp and point to point tunneling protocol pptp implementations of the windows   me  nt  and xp operating systems 
we offer high performance compression processors that implement lzs and mppc 
we also license software implementations of lzs and mppc to industry leading network equipment vendors for use in their networking products 
in support of emerging vpn architectures  we have led the industry by introducing the first network security processors  integrating the critical functions of compression  encryption and data authentication in compliance with the internet protocol security ipsec protocol 
this integration allows network equipment vendors to add highly integrated  high performance vpn capabilities to their routers  remote access concentrators  switches  broadband access equipment and firewalls 
furthermore  we also license a complete and portable software implementation of the ipsec protocol  allowing network vendors to get to market more quickly with their vpn implementations at a fraction of the cost of internal software development efforts 
businesses are increasingly dependent upon the public internet in conducting their normal business operations 
unlike the traditional telecommunications network used by businesses to communicate  the public internet is vastly more complex and unreliable 
in addition  there is currently an overall lack of differentiation or prioritization of business critical functions from general use of the internet 
rather  these functions are bundled together and use the same resources throughout the public internet 
our flow classification solutions enable the integration of precise differentiation and measurement of business critical transactions within network equipment vendors devices 
this feature allows the creation of differentiated services within the public internet 
hifn s line of compression processors targeted at back up storage applications provides storage equipment vendors high performance implementations of our patented compression technology  doubling the capacity and performance of mid to high end tape drive systems 
the lzs implementation of our patents is used in the digital linear tape dlt tape drive products from quantum 
the adaptive lossless data compression aldc implementation of our patents  developed by ibm  is used in a variety of tape storage products  including the travan style of quarter inch cartridge tape drives 

table of contents customers and products a number of leading manufacturers of network and storage equipment have designed products that incorporate our products 
to date  we have secured several design wins with networking and storage equipment vendors 
to qualify as a design win  an equipment vendor must have ordered samples of our packet processors or an evaluation board and initiated a product design that incorporates our packet processors 
during the design in process  we work with each customer  providing training on our products  assisting in resolving technical questions and providing price and delivery information to assist the customer in getting our products into volume production 
we cannot assure that any of the design wins we have secured will result in demand for our products 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends and uncertainties our business depends upon the development of the packet processor market and we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
at september   we had a backlog of semiconductor orders representing million of products deliverable to customers over the months following the placement of these orders 
at september   we had a backlog of million 
because we quote product lead times to customers of approximately three months  most products shipped during a quarter are ordered during the previous quarter 
since customers may reschedule or cancel orders  subject to negotiated windows  orders scheduled for shipment in a quarter may be moved to a subsequent quarter or cancelled altogether 
therefore  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales

table of contents integrated  high performance packet processing 
hifn is continuing to develop additional packet processing functionality  including the implementation of advanced public key encryption algorithms  continued integration of computation intensive security protocol processing functions  and integration of the meterflow classification capabilities 
ongoing product and technology development is expected to increase product integration and increase product performance in the future 
intellectual property our future success and ability to compete are dependent  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
we rely in part on patent  trade secret  trademark  maskwork and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property 
we own united states patents and four foreign patents 
we also have two pending patent applications in japan 
the issued patents and patent applications primarily cover various aspects of our compression  bandwidth management and rate shaping technologies and have expiration dates ranging from to in addition to compression  we have six pending patent applications in the united states  four in europe and asia japan covering our flow classification technology 
we cannot assure that any patents will be issued under our current or future patent applications or that the patents issued under such patent applications will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
we cannot assure that any patents issued to us will be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
in addition  we cannot assure that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patents  mask work rights  intellectual property or copyrights on certain of our products and technologies 
although we are not currently a party to any material litigation regarding intellectual property  in the event a third party were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license relating to such intellectual property was not available on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources  may also be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the occurrence of litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
in addition  we claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
although we intend to protect our rights vigorously  we cannot assure that these measures will be successful 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property 
export restrictions on encryption algorithms a key element of hifn s packet processor architecture is the encryption algorithms embedded in our semiconductor and software products 
these products are subject to export control regulations administered by the us department of commerce 
the regulations permit our domestic network equipment customers to export non military specific products incorporating our encryption technology only after the finished product has received a one time technical review from the department of commerce 
in addition  those us export control laws prohibit the export of many products  including any products with encryption  to a number of countries deemed hostile by the us government currently there are nine such countries 
furthermore  us government regulations require export licenses from the department of state for all military specific products 

table of contents us export regulations have recently been liberalized to allow for the export of most encryption hardware  software  and technology to foreign non government entities after the product receives a one time technical review from the commerce department 
the technical review process generally takes days from the date the government logs the application into its computer system 
in addition  the us government now allows us exporters to immediately ship products to both government and non government end users in the european union eu and eight other friendly countries eu immediately upon submission of the required technical review paperwork 
if exports to government end users are required to countries outside of the eu group  an individual export license is required from the department of commerce 
as a result of the recent liberalizations  our network equipment customers may be able to effectively compete with eu competitors 
however  foreign competitors facing less stringent controls and who may have effectively established markets for their products prior to the relaxation of us export restrictions may be able to compete more effectively than our network equipment customers in the global market 
furthermore  us regulations are constantly changing and we cannot assure that the liberalizing trends will continue  that the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  or the regulatory policies with respect thereto  will not be revised from time to time  or that laws limiting the domestic use of encryption will not be enacted 
the sale of our packet processors could be hindered or harmed by the failure of our network equipment customers to obtain the required technical reviews or by the costs of compliance 
see sales  marketing technical support 
competition the networking and storage equipment markets into which we sell our products are intensely competitive and are subject to frequent product introductions with improved price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  unit price erosion and the continued emergence of new industry standards 
the semiconductor industry is also intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence and unit price erosion 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from companies that may enter our existing or future markets  including certain customers  with similar or substitute solutions that may be less costly or provide better performance or features than our products 
to be successful in the future  we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to changing customer performance  feature and pricing requirements  technological change and competitors innovations 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products compete with products from companies such as analog devices  inc  safenet  inc  international business machines ibm  broadcom corporation  motorola  inc and philips corporation 
in  stac entered into two license agreements with ibm where stac granted ibm the right to use  but not sublicense  our patented compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
stac also entered into a license agreement with microsoft in whereby stac granted microsoft the right to use  but not sublicense  our compression technology in their software products 
stac s license agreement with microsoft  however  prohibits microsoft from creating hardware implementations of our patents 
we also compete against software solutions that use general purpose microprocessors to run encryption algorithms and our software compression libraries 
in addition  as noted above  our encryption compression and public key processors are subject to export control restrictions administered by the us department of commerce  which permit our network equipment customers to export products incorporating encryption technology only after receiving a one time technical review 
as a result of these regulations  sales by foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their encryption products could hinder or harm the sale of our encryption compression and public key processors to network equipment customers in the global market 
we believe that the recent change to the us export regulations will enable us and our network equipment customers to obtain comparable footing with our european competitors 
however  we expect significant future competition from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers 
several established electronics and semiconductor suppliers have recently entered or indicated an intent to enter the network equipment market 
we may also face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
furthermore  many 
table of contents of our existing and potential customers internally develop asics  general purpose microprocessors and other devices which attempt to perform all or a portion of the functions performed by our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us 
in particular  companies such as intel corporation  lucent technologies inc  motorola  national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments incorporated have proprietary semiconductor manufacturing ability  preferred vendor status with many of our customers  extensive marketing power and name recognition  greater financial resources than us and other significant advantages over us 
in addition  current and potential competitors may determine  for strategic reasons  to consolidate  to lower the price of their products substantially or to bundle their products with other products 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that important competitive factors in our markets are price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  the continued emergence of new industry standards  length of development cycles  design wins with major network and storage equipment vendors  support for new network and storage standards  features and functionality  adaptability of products to specific applications  reliability  technical service and support and protection of products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws 
our failure to successfully develop products that compete successfully with those of other suppliers in the market would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we must compete for the services of qualified distributors and sales representatives 
to the extent that our competitors offer such distributors or sales representatives more favorable terms on a higher volume of business  such distributors or sales representatives may decline to carry  or discontinue carrying  our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any failure to maintain and expand our distribution network 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends and uncertainties our markets are highly competitive 
research and development our success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to continue to make  substantial investments in research and development 
extensive product development input is obtained from customers and through our participation in industry organizations and standards setting bodies such as the internet engineering task force ietf 
as of september   our research and development staff consisted of employees 
our research and development expenditures were million in the fiscal year ended september   million in the fiscal year ended september  and million in the fiscal year ended september   representing  and of revenues for such periods  respectively 
research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities  costs of fabricating chip mask sets and subcontracting costs 
research and development costs in fiscal and also include amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the acquisition of apptitude 
we perform our research and product development activities at our facilities in los gatos  california and carlsbad  california 
we seek to hire additional skilled development engineers 
the acquisition of apptitude in august further strengthened our development efforts  adding to our pool of software expertise and intellectual properties 
furthermore  we are able to expand our product base to 
table of contents include acceleration for firewall applications  bandwith management  load balancing  qos and cos 
also in august  we purchased unique patented traffic flow control technology to further enhance the bandwith management features of apptitude s technology 
in april  we acquired a software implementation of the ipsec protocol from cylan technologies  inc as part of the acquisition  we gained expertise in the development of software implementations of a wide range of networking protocol functions  including ipsec and transmission control protocol internet protocol tcp ip 
our future performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  properly identify target markets and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
in evaluating new product decisions  we must anticipate well in advance the future demand for product features and performance characteristics  as well as available supporting technologies  manufacturing capacity  industry standards and competitive product offerings 
we cannot assure that our design and introduction schedules for any additions and enhancements to our existing and future products will be able to be sold at prices that are favorable to us 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue enhancing the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are inherently complex and require long development cycles 
such innovations must be completed before developments in networking technologies or standards render them obsolete and must be sufficiently compelling to induce network and storage equipment vendors to favor them over alternative technologies 
moreover  we must generally incur substantial research and development costs before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product line can be ascertained 
we cannot assure that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development 
the failure to successfully develop new products on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends and uncertainties we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
sales  marketing technical support we market our products through a direct sales and marketing organization  headquartered in los gatos  california  with sales offices in massachusetts  colorado  north carolina and quebec  canada  and through independent contract sales representatives in the united states  europe  japan and other areas 
we also retain account managers to focus on individual customer relationships 
we do not have any foreign operations and sales of our products to foreign companies  other than product shipments to contract manufacturers of domestic customers  have not been material 
sales representatives are selected for their understanding of the marketplace and their ability to provide effective field sales support for our products 
our relationships with some of our sales representatives have been established within the last two years  and we are unable to predict the extent to which some of these representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
sales to us customers account for the substantial majority of our revenues 
due to the export controls imposed by the us government until recently on encryption products  our shipments to international customers have been limited to compression processors and compression software 
the recent relaxation of controls has opened new opportunities for our products sales around the world 
in early  we entered into a distribution agreement with a worldwide electronics distribution company which we believe provides us with the ability to respond to significant pent up demand for network security products around the world 
we continue to actively work with our network equipment customers and the us government to comply with us export controls to facilitate the export of our customers products which incorporate our encryption 
table of contents products 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts and that competitors outside of the us will not develop encryption products to meet the needs of our customers  thereby reducing the opportunity for us to sell our products 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends and uncertainties our products are subject to export restrictions 
hifn has a number of marketing programs designed to inform network and storage equipment vendors about the capabilities and benefits of our products 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows  technical conferences  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  maintenance of our website  advertising and direct mail distribution of our literature 
technical support to customers is provided through field applications engineers and  if necessary  product designers 
local field support is provided in person or by telephone 
we believe that providing customers with comprehensive product service and support is critical to maintaining a competitive position in the market and is critical to shortening the time required to design in our products 
we work with our customers to monitor the performance of our product designs and to provide support at each stage of customer product development 
manufacturing currently  we subcontract all semiconductor manufacturing on a turnkey basis  with our suppliers delivering fully assembled and tested products based on our proprietary designs 
the use of the fabless model allows us to focus substantially all of our resources on determining customer requirements and on the design  development and support of our products 
this model also allows us to have significantly reduced capital requirements 
we subcontract our semiconductor manufacturing to atmel corporation  motorola and toshiba corporation 
the selection of these manufacturers was based on the breadth of available technology  quality  manufacturing capacity and support for design tools used by us 
none of our products are currently manufactured by more than one supplier 
however  we expect that in the event one of our suppliers notifies us that it intends to cease manufacturing a product  we will have an adequate opportunity to order sufficient quantities of the affected products so that shipments to customers will not be adversely affected while we qualify a new manufacturer 
at any given time  we use mainstream processes for the manufacture of our products  avoiding dependence on the latest process technology available 
this approach reduces our technical risks and avoids the risks related to production capacity constraints typically associated with leading edge semiconductor processes 
this approach allows us to focus on providing differentiated functionality  the primary value add in our products 
our current main products are manufactured using   
and 
micron complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos processes 
products under development are being designed with the 
micron cmos process 
we believe that transitioning our products to increasingly smaller semiconductor dimensions will be important for us to remain competitive 
we cannot assure that future process migration will be achieved without difficulty 
we intend to continue for the foreseeable future to rely on our subcontract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and test requirements 
all of our subcontract manufacturers produce products for other companies 
we do not have long term manufacturing agreements with any of our subcontract manufacturers 
our subcontract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order that has been accepted by one of our subcontract manufacturers 
we must place orders approximately to weeks in advance of expected delivery 
as a result  we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
failure of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity to rise along with a rise in demand could result in our subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to customers that are larger or have long term supply contracts in place 
our inability to obtain adequate foundry capacity at acceptable prices  or any delay or interruption in supply  could reduce our

our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe our employee relations are good 
our future success is heavily dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for engineering personnel with related security  networking and integrated circuit design expertise  and applications support personnel with networking product design expertise

item legal proceedings in october and november  six purported class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against hifn and certain of its officers and directors 
these complaints were consolidated into in re hi fn sec 
litig  no 
si 
the consolidated complaint was filed on behalf of a class of purchasers of hifn s stock during the period july  through october  the class period 
the complaint seeks unspecified money damages and alleges that hifn and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws in connection with various public statements made by hifn and certain of its officers and directors during the class period 
in august  the court dismissed the complaint as to all defendants  other than raymond j 
farnham and hifn 
mr 
farnham and hifn answered the complaint in september discovery has commenced 
a trial date has been tentatively scheduled for october we believe that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and intend to defend the action vigorously 
due to the nature of the allegations  management cannot estimate the possible loss  if any  or range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the allegations 
however  based on the facts currently known  management does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
in december  a former employee of hifn filed suit against hifn and one of its former employees alleging wrongful termination  invasion of privacy  violation of fair employment and housing act  based on sexual harassment  sexual discrimination and retaliation  defamation  breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing  negligence and conversion 
on april   we filed an answer to the complaint  generally denying its allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses 
discovery has recently commenced  and no trial date has been set 
the parties have voluntarily agreed to participate in a mediation session in an effort to amicably resolve the matter 
in the event the matter is not amicably resolved  we intend to defend the matter vigorously 
while the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time  management does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position

revenues from one customer and its manufacturing subcontractor represented  and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
revenues from another customer and its manufacturing subcontractors represented  and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in august  hifn completed its acquisition of apptitude  a provider of embedded internet traffic analysis solutions through a merger of apptitude with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of hifn 
the aggregate purchase consideration was million  million in cash and million in stock 
in exchange  we received tangible assets and assumed liabilities as well as intangible assets including developed and core technology  workforce and patents 
additionally  we acquired in process research and development costs which were expensed at the time of the acquisition 
hifn s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of proprietary and second source products sold  market acceptance of our and our customers products  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in 
table of contents manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  our access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if we are unable to introduce new products with higher margins  maintain our product mix between proprietary and second source products  or reduce manufacturing cost to offset decreases in the prices of our existing products  then our operating results will be adversely affected 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
since most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand 
customer demand remains highly unpredictable and variances to the forecast can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of high fixed costs in the semiconductor industry  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  material adverse fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which have in the past  and would in the future  materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended september  net revenues costs and operating expenses cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles and goodwill purchased in process research development total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended september   and net revenues 
revenue from sales of semiconductors and licenses of software libraries decreased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  revenue increased compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our data compression and encryption processors to network equipment manufacturers partially offset by an increase in license and software revenues 
the increase in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increasing sales of our data compression and encryption processors to network equipment manufacturers 
semiconductor sales to quantum  an original equipment manufacturer of high performance tape storage devices  through its manufacturing subcontractor  comprised  and of revenue in each of fiscal years  and  respectively 
semiconductor sales to lucent  an original equipment manufacturer of networking equipment  through its manufacturing subcontractors  comprised  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 

table of contents cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of semiconductors which were manufactured to our specifications by third parties for resale by us 
cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal primarily reflects a million charge during the third quarter of fiscal for excess inventory 
this charge resulted from a decrease in demand below our previous expectations 
excluding the excess inventory charge  cost of revenues for fiscal was of net revenues 
in addition to the charge there was a shift in the revenue mix from to and an increase in overhead expenses including supplies and facility rental costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal research and development expenses increased in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in research and development costs in each successive period was due to increases in labor  benefits  building expenses and depreciation costs related to the addition of research and development personnel related to the acquisition of apptitude in august  offset by a reduction in outside services costs for contractors previously used to develop new products 
amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the acquisition of apptitude of million and  in fiscal and  respectively  also contributed to the increase in research and development expense in each of these fiscal years 
we expect our investments in research and development to continue to increase in coming periods on an absolute basis as we continue to develop products targeted at meeting market needs 
however  we cannot assure that product development programs invested in by us will be successful or that products resulting from such programs will achieve market acceptance 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in each successive fiscal year was primarily due to increased headcount and outside services to support sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of revenues  in fiscal  million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal the continued increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to higher salaries and benefits costs as a result of increased headcount as well as office administration and depreciation costs 
additionally  amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the acquisition of apptitude of million and  for fiscal and  respectively  contributed to the increase 
legal and accounting costs for the fiscal years ended  and were   and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles and goodwill 
amortization of intangibles and goodwill of million  or of net revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal related to the acquisition of apptitude and other intellectual property in august purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development ipr d related to the acquisition of apptitude in august was million or of revenues 
purchased ipr d related to the value assigned to apptitude s meterflow asic product which had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  for fiscal were million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal and million  or of revenues  for fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of a shift in the investment mix from stock instruments to commercial paper and municipal bonds  lower average cash and short term investments balance during fiscal as compared to fiscal as well as an overall decrease in interest rates 
income taxes 
the effective tax rates for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal and income tax provisions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the resulting effective tax rates are primarily the 
table of contents result of the non deductibility of certain acquisition related costs consisting primarily of the amortization of intangibles and goodwill 
the effective tax rate for fiscal of is below the combined statutory tax rate of due primarily to the fact that there is no tax benefit from the accounting amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we recognize deferred income tax asset for the expected future benefits attributable to the differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the net change during the year in the deferred income tax liability or asset 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
in fiscal  we generated cash from operating activities of approximately million comprised of net loss as adjusted for non cash items including amortization of intangibles and deferred stock compensation of million  depreciation and amortization costs of million  tax benefit from employee stock plans of million and an increase in deferred income taxes of million as well as a decrease in accounts receivable of million and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  these adjustments were offset mainly by increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  other assets of million  inventory of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  in fiscal  we generated cash from operating activities of approximately million comprised of net income as adjusted for non cash items including purchased in process research and development of million  amortization of intangibles and deferred stock compensation of million  deferred income taxes of million  depreciation and amortization costs of million and tax benefit from employee stock plans of million as well as a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
these adjustments were offset mainly by decreases in income taxes payable of million and in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  resulting from the purchase of short term investments of million and the acquisition of million in property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  consisting primarily of the acquisition of apptitude and the purchase of intellectual property aggregating million  the purchase of short term investments of million and the acquisition of million in property and equipment 
our capital expenditures in fiscal reflect costs incurred in relation to the consolidation of our northern california facilities as well as the additional facilities in los gatos and carlsbad 
we expect capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to approximate those levels as in fiscal financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and fiscal of million and million  respectively  reflect proceeds from the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases slightly offset by payments on debt obligations 
in march  hifn paid a million loan and paid a total of million in transfers to our former parent  stac 
also during  we raised approximately million in an equity offering 
in april  our underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock  which yielded an additional million in proceeds to us 
we use a number of independent suppliers to manufacture substantially all of our products 
as a result  we rely on these suppliers to allocate to us a sufficient portion of foundry capacity to meet our needs and deliver sufficient quantities of our products on a timely basis 
these arrangements allow us to avoid utilizing our capital resources for manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory and to focus a substantial proportion of our resources on the design  development and marketing of our products 
we require funds to finance our working capital  particularly accounts receivable and manufactured inventory  and to finance investments in property and equipment 
our need to raise capital in the future will depend on many factors including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our existing and new products  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing and size of acquisitions 
table of contents of businesses or technologies  the timing of the introduction of new products and the expansion of sales and marketing efforts 
in august  we completed our acquisition of apptitude 
the purchase price of the acquisition of million  which included  in estimated acquisition related costs  was used to acquire the net assets of apptitude 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows property and equipment current and other assets deferred tax asset liabilities assumed goodwill purchased in process research and development acquired developed and core technology  workforce and patents the goodwill  acquired developed and core technology  workforce and patents are recorded on the balance sheet as intangibles and other assets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from two to five years 
the purchased in process research and development was expensed at the time of the acquisition as a one time charge 
however  as a result of scheduled adoption of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we will cease amortization of goodwill beginning october  goodwill amortization expense aggregated million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
trends and uncertainties in future periods  hifn s business  financial condition and results of operations may be affected by many factors  including but not limited to the following our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors including the following general business conditions in our markets as well as global economic uncertainty  increases or reductions in demand for our customers products  the timing and volume of orders we receive from our customers  cancellations or delays of customer product orders  acquisitions or mergers involving us  our competitors or customers  any new product introductions by us or our competitors  our suppliers increasing costs or changing the delivery of products to us  increased competition or reductions in the prices that we are able to charge  the variety of the products that we sell as well as seasonal demand for our products  and the availability of manufacturing capacity necessary to make our products 
we depend upon a small number of customers 
quantum corporation quantum  through its manufacturing subcontractor  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues in fiscal  and lucent  through its manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately  and of our revenues during fiscal 
table of contents  and  respectively 
neither quantum nor lucent are under any binding obligation to order from us 
if our sales to quantum or lucent decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we expect that our most significant customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today for a number of reasons  including customers deployment schedules and budget considerations 
as a result  we believe we may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and an annual basis 
limited numbers of network and storage equipment vendors account for a majority of packet processor purchases in their respective markets 
in particular  the market for network equipment that would include packet processors  such as routers  remote access concentrators and firewalls  is dominated by a few large vendors  including cisco systems  inc  lucent technologies inc  nortel networks  inc 
and com corporation 
as a result  our future success will depend upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with these companies 
if these network equipment vendors do not incorporate our packet processors into their products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our business depends upon the development of the packet processor market 
our prospects are dependent upon the acceptance of packet processors as an alternative to other technology traditionally utilized by network and storage equipment vendors 
many of our current and potential customers have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources and currently develop internally the application specific integrated circuit components and program the general purpose microprocessors utilized in their products as an alternative to our packet processors 
these customers may in the future continue to rely on these solutions or may determine to develop or acquire components  technologies or packet processors that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
in order to be successful  we must anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of such network and storage equipment vendors and must successfully develop and manufacture products that meet their requirements 
in addition  we must make products available to these large customers on a timely basis and at competitive prices 
if orders from customers are cancelled  decreased or delayed  or if we fail to obtain significant orders from new customers  or any significant customer delays or fails to pay  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our business depends upon the continued growth and our penetration of the virtual private network market 
we want to be a leading supplier of packet processors that implement the network security protocols necessary to support the deployment of virtual private networks 
this emerging market  which is still evolving  may not grow and if it does continue to grow  our products may not successfully serve this market 
our ability to generate significant revenue in the virtual private network market will depend upon  among other things  the following our ability to demonstrate the benefits of our technology to distributors  original equipment manufacturers and end users  and the increased use of the internet by businesses as replacements for  or enhancements to  their private networks 
if we are unable to penetrate the virtual private network market  or if that market fails to develop  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

table of contents we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards 
our performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to do the following properly identify emerging target markets and related technological trends  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
our past success has been dependent in part upon our ability to develop products that have been selected for design into new products of leading equipment manufacturers 
however  the development of our packet processors is complex and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
we may not be able to adhere to our new product design and introduction schedules and our products may not be accepted in the market at favorable prices  if at all 
in evaluating new product decisions  we must anticipate future demand for product features and performance characteristics  as well as available supporting technologies  manufacturing capacity  competitive product offerings and industry standards 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are complicated and require a significant amount of time and money 
we may experience substantial difficulty in introducing new products and we may be unable to offer enhancements to existing products on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
for instance  the performance of our encryption compression and public key processors depends upon the integrity of our security technology 
if any significant advances in overcoming cryptographic systems are made  then the security of our encryption compression and public key processors will be reduced or eliminated unless we are able to develop further technical innovations that adequately enhance the security of these products 
our inability to develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are highly competitive 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and are expected to become more competitive as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
the markets that we compete in are subject to frequent product introductions with improved price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  and the continued emergence of new industry standards 
our products compete with offerings from companies such as analog devices  inc  safenet  inc  ibm  broadcom corporation  motorola  inc and philips corporation 
in  stac entered into two license agreements with ibm in which stac granted ibm the right to use  but not sublicense  our patented compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
stac also entered into a license agreement with microsoft corporation microsoft in whereby stac granted microsoft the right to use  but not sublicense  our compression technology in their software products 
we expect significant future competition from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers 
several established electronics and semiconductor suppliers have recently entered  or expressed an interest to enter  the network equipment market 
we also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential customers internally develop solutions which attempt to perform all or a portion of the functions performed by our products 
a key element of our packet processor architecture is our encryption technology 
until recently  in order to export our encryption related products  the us department of commerce required us to obtain a license 

table of contents foreign competitors that were not subject to similar requirements have an advantage over us in their ability to establish existing markets for their products and rapidly respond to the requests of customers in the global market 
although the export restriction has been liberalized  we may not be successful in entering or competing in the foreign encryption markets 
see our products are subject to export restrictions 
many of our current and prospective competitors offer broader product lines and have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to promote the sale of their products 
in particular  companies such as intel corporation  lucent technologies inc  motorola  inc  national semiconductor corporation  and texas instruments incorporated have a significant advantage over us given their relationships with many of our customers  their extensive marketing power and name recognition and their much greater financial resources 
in addition  current and potential competitors may decide to consolidate  lower the prices of their products or to bundle their products with other products 
any of the above would significantly and negatively impact our ability to compete and obtain or maintain market share 
if we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors  our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
we believe that the important competitive factors in our markets are the following performance  price  the time that is required to develop a new product or enhancements to existing products  the ability to achieve product acceptance with major network and storage equipment vendors  the support that exists for new network and storage standards  features and functionality  adaptability of products to specific applications  reliability  and technical service and support as well as effective intellectual property protection 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market products that compete with those of other suppliers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  we must compete for the services of qualified distributors and sales representatives 
to the extent that our competitors offer distributors or sales representatives more favorable terms  these distributors and sales representatives may decline to carry  or discontinue carrying  our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any failure to maintain and expand our distribution network 
our business depends upon the growth of the network equipment and storage equipment markets 
our success is largely dependent upon continued growth in the market for network security equipment  such as routers  remote access concentrators  switches  broadband access equipment  security gateways  firewalls and network interface cards 
in addition  our success depends upon storage equipment vendors incorporating our packet processors into their systems 
the network security equipment market has in the past  and may in the future  fluctuate significantly based upon numerous factors  including the lack of industry standards  adoption of alternative technologies  capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
we are unable to determine the rate or extent to which these markets will grow  if at all 
any decrease in the growth of the network or storage equipment market or a decline in demand for our products could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon protecting our intellectual property 
our proprietary technology is critical to our future success 
we rely in part on patent  trade  trademark  maskwork and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
we own united states patents and four 
table of contents foreign patents 
we also have pending patent applications in japan 
our issued patents and patent applications primarily cover various aspects of our compression technology and have expiration dates ranging from to in addition to compression  we have six pending patent applications in the united states  four in europe and asia japan covering our flow classification technology 
there are pending patent applications in the united states covering our bandwidth management and rate shaping technology 
patents may not be issued under our current or future patent applications  and the patents issued under such patent applications could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  third parties could make infringement claims against us in the future 
such infringement claims could result in costly litigation 
we may not prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
regardless of the outcome  an infringement claim would likely result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the patents issued to us may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
in addition  others could develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
we also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
however  our efforts may not be successful 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property 
the length of time it takes to develop our products and make a sale to our customers may impair our operating results 
our customers typically take a long time to evaluate our products 
in fact  it usually takes our customers to months or more to test our products with an additional to months or more before they commence significant production of equipment incorporating our products 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts on the one hand  and the generation of higher revenues  if any  on the other hand 
in addition  the delays inherent in such a lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans  which could result in the loss of anticipated sales 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer if customers reduce or delay orders or choose not to release products using our technology 
we depend upon independent manufacturers and limited sources of supply 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and test our packet processors 
we currently subcontract our semiconductor manufacturing to atmel corporation  toshiba corporation and motorola  inc since we depend upon independent manufacturers  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
none of our products are manufactured by more than one supplier 
since the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  foundry capacity has been very limited at times in the past and may become limited in the future 
we depend on our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of finished product to us in a timely manner 
since we place orders on a purchase order basis and do not have long term volume purchase agreements with any of our suppliers  our suppliers may allocate production capacity to other products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
for example  in june  one of our suppliers delayed the delivery of one of our products 
as a result  we switched production of the product to a new manufacturer 
this caused a month delay in shipments to customers 
we also experienced yield and test anomalies on a different product manufactured by another subcontractor that could have interrupted our customer shipments 
in this case  the manufacturer was able to correct the problem in a timely manner and customer shipments were not affected 
the delay and expense associated with qualifying a new supplier or foundry and commencing volume 
table of contents production can result in lost revenue  reduced operating margins and possible harm to customer relationships 
the steps required for a new manufacturer to begin production of a semiconductor product include adapting our product design  if necessary  to the new manufacturer s process  creating a new mask set to manufacture the product  having the new manufacturer prepare sample products so we can verify the product specification  and providing sample products to customers for qualification 
in general  it takes from to months for a new manufacturer to begin full scale production of one of our products 
we could have similar or more protracted problems in the future with existing or new suppliers 
both toshiba corporation and motorola  inc manufacture products for us in plants located in asia 
to date  the financial and stock market dislocations that have occurred in the asian financial markets in the past have not harmed our business 
however  present or future dislocations or other international business risks  such as currency exchange fluctuations or recessions  could force us to seek new suppliers 
we must place orders approximately to weeks in advance of expected delivery 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  and could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
in addition  if global semiconductor manufacturing capacity fails to increase in line with demand  foundries could allocate available capacity to larger customers or customers with long term supply contracts 
if we cannot obtain adequate foundry capacity at acceptable prices  or our supply is interrupted or delayed  our product revenues could decrease or our cost of revenues could increase 
this could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we regularly consider using smaller semiconductor dimensions for each of our products in order to reduce costs 
we have begun to decrease the dimensions in our new product designs  and believe that we must do so to remain competitive 
we may have difficulty decreasing the dimensions of our products 
in the future  we may change our supply arrangements to assume more product manufacturing responsibilities 
we may subcontract for wafer manufacturing  assembly and test rather than purchase finished products 
however  there are additional risks associated with manufacturing  including variances in production yields  the ability to obtain adequate test and assembly capacity at reasonable cost and other general risks associated with the manufacture of semiconductors 
we may also enter into volume purchase agreements that would require us to commit to minimum levels of purchases and which may require up front investments 
if we fail to effectively assume greater manufacturing responsibilities or manage volume purchase arrangements  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
network and storage equipment prices typically decrease 
average selling prices in the networking  storage and semiconductor industries have rapidly declined due to many factors  including rapidly changing technologies  price performance enhancements  and product obsolescence 
the decline in the average selling prices of our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future due to product introductions by our competitors  price pressures from significant customers and other factors 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features which we can sell at higher prices 
if we fail to do so  our revenues and gross margins could decline  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face product return  product liability and product defect risks 
complex products such as ours frequently contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have discovered such errors  defects and bugs in the past 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could hinder market acceptance of our products 
this could damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
errors  defects or bugs could also cause interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
we would have to expend significant capital and resources to remedy these problems 
errors  defects or bugs could be discovered in our new products after we begin commercial production of them  despite testing by us and our suppliers and customers 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face order and shipment uncertainties 
we generally make our sales under individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty  if any 
cancellation or deferral of product orders could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to our customers  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
an unanticipated level of returns could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism and other events beyond our control 
our facilities and the facilities of our subcontractors in the state of california have in the past and may again in the future be subject to electrical black outs as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event these blackouts resume or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operation of our facilities and the affected facilities of our subcontractors and such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend upon key personnel 
our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our key management and other personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our key personnel  nor do we maintain any key man life insurance on any of our personnel 
several members of our management team have joined us in the last months 
it may be difficult for us to integrate new members of our management team 
we must also attract and retain experienced and highly skilled engineering  sales and marketing and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense in the geographic areas and market segments in which we compete  and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining such people 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  or cannot attract or retain qualified personnel  particularly engineers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in addition  companies in technology industries whose employees accept positions with competitors have in the past claimed that their competitors have engaged in unfair competition or hiring practices 
we could receive such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
these claims could result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against any such claims  regardless of their merits 
our rapid growth may strain our operations 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion which has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our resources 
to accommodate this growth  in fiscal  we implemented a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of the retained accounting and other internal management systems which were provided by stac 
this required and may continue to require substantial management effort  and our efforts to do so may not continue to be 
table of contents successful 
in addition  we have had to hire additional employees to accommodate this growth and our product development activities 
this has resulted in increased responsibilities for our management 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our operations 
if we fail to improve our operational  financial and management information systems  or to hire  train  motivate or manage our employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our products are subject to export restrictions 
the encryption algorithms embedded in our products are a key element of our packet processor architecture 
these products are subject to us department of commerce export control restrictions 
our network equipment customers may only export products incorporating encryption technology if they obtain a one time technical review 
these us export laws also prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of countries deemed by the us to be hostile 
many foreign countries also restrict exports to many of these countries deemed to be terrorist supporting states by the us government 
because the restrictions on exports of encryption products have been liberalized  we  along with our network equipment customers have an opportunity to effectively compete with our foreign competitors 
the existence of these restrictions until recently may have enabled foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products to become more established and  therefore  more competitive in the global market than our network equipment customers 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised  and laws limiting the domestic use of encryption could be enacted 
while the us government now allows us companies to assume that exports to non government end users will be approved within days of official registration with the department of commerce  the sale of our packet processors could be harmed by the failure of our network equipment customers to obtain the required approvals or by the costs of compliance 
we face risks associated with our international business activities 
we sell most of our products to customers in the united states 
if our international sales increase  particularly in light of decreased export restrictions  we may encounter risks inherent in international operations 
all of our international sales to date are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to foreign currencies  our products could become less competitive in international markets 
we also obtain some of our manufacturing  assembly and test services from suppliers located outside the united states 
international business activities could be limited or disrupted by any of the following the imposition of governmental controls  export license technical review requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  currency exchange fluctuations  political instability  financial and stock market dislocations  military and related activities  trade restrictions  and changes in tariffs 
demand for our products also could be harmed by seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets 
these international factors could harm future sales of our products to international customers and our business  financial condition and results of operations in general 

table of contents we face risks associated with acquisitions 
we continually evaluate strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies that would complement our product offerings or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities 
while we are not currently negotiating any acquisitions  we may make additional acquisitions in the future 
future acquisitions could be effected without stockholder approval  and could cause us to dilute shareholder equity  incur debt and contingent liabilities and amortize acquisition expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies and products  in particular  if we fail to successfully integrate the acquisition of apptitude  the anticipated benefits of this transaction will not occur  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we acquire 
if we fail to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry may harm our business 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this has caused significant variances in product demand  production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices 
industry wide fluctuations in the future could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology related companies including networking  storage and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
such fluctuations can result from quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of new products by us or our competitors  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in analysts estimates  short selling of our common stock  and events affecting other companies that investors deem to be comparable to us 
we are currently engaged in several securities class action lawsuits 
in october and november  six purported class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against hifn and certain of its officers and directors 
these complaints were consolidated into in re hi fn sec 
litig  no 
si 
the consolidated complaint was filed on behalf of a class of purchasers of hifn s stock during the period july  through october  the class period 
the complaint seeks unspecified money damages and alleges that hifn and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws in connection with various public statements made by hifn and certain of its officers and directors during the class period 
in august  the court dismissed the complaint as to all defendants  other than raymond j 
farnham and hifn 
mr 
farnham 
table of contents and hifn answered the complaint in september discovery has commenced 
a trial date has been tentatively scheduled for october we believe that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and intend to defend the action vigorously 
due to the nature of the allegations  management cannot estimate the possible loss  if any  or range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the allegations 
however  based on the facts currently known  management does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
in december  a former employee of hifn filed suit against hifn and one of its former employees alleging wrongful termination  invasion of privacy  violation of fair employment and housing act  based on sexual harassment  sexual discrimination and retaliation  defamation  breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing  negligence and conversion 
on april   we filed an answer to the complaint  generally denying its allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses 
discovery has recently commenced  and no trial date has been set 
the parties have voluntarily agreed to participate in a mediation session in an effort to amicably resolve the matter 
in the event the matter is not amicably resolved  we intend to defend the matter vigorously 
while the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time  management does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas will apply to all business combinations that we enter into after june   and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new statements  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in addition  the statements include provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we are required to adopt these statements for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning october  at which time the company will cease amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense aggregated million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
as of september   we have not determined the effect the adoption of these statements and we intend to continue to perform an impairment analysis of the remaining goodwill through the end of fiscal year upon adoption on october   we will perform the required impairment tests of goodwill and has not yet determined the effect of these tests on our earnings and financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides further guidance regarding the accounting and disclosure of long lived assets 
we are required to adopt sfas effective october   and have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of commercial paper and municipal bonds 
we place investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of september  would have an immaterial effect on our pre tax earnings and the carrying value of our investments over the next fiscal year 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk all of our sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  our results of operations are not subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been incurred by us to date
