market risk the company derived approximately of its consolidated revenues outside of north america 
the company s activities expose it to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on its operating results 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on its operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  the company exposes itself to some counterparty credit risk 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which it enters into such agreements 
the company currently uses cash flow hedges 
these instruments are hedges of forecasted transactions or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
the company generally enters into forward exchange contracts expiring within one year as hedges of anticipated cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from its variable rate borrowings 
at december   the company had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and had sold in accounts receivable on a variable rate basis 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the interest rate for of variable rate borrowings 
the swap agreement exposes the company to credit risk in the event the counterparty could not perform under the agreement 
the company managed this risk by entering into the interest rate swap agreement with a highly rated financial institution 
based upon the company s exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percent point change in the weighted average interest rate would change the company s annual interest expense by approximately fluctuations in quarterly results the company has experienced  and in the future could experience  quarterly variations in revenues as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include the timing of increased expenses incurred in support of new business  the timing and frequency of client spending for system enhancement requests  the timing of contractual rate reductions triggered by subscriber growth or the passage of time and the seasonal pattern of the customer management segment of the company
