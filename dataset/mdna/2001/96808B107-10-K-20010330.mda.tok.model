overview store openings  closings  sales  remodels  relocations and acquisitions 
in fiscal  we opened new stores in laguna niguel  san diego two and yorba linda  california  kansas city  kansas  st 
louis  missouri  reno  nevada  cleveland and cincinnati  ohio  bend and portland  oregon  and relocated three stores in west hartford  connecticut  las vegas  nevada  and salt lake city  utah 
we also acquired two operating natural food stores in escondido and hemet  california 
we plan to open or relocate as many as eight stores in fiscal through the date of this report  we have opened four new stores in irvine  california  westport  connecticut  omaha  nebraska and cleveland  ohio 
our ability to open additional stores in fiscal and beyond will depend upon our ability to successfully negotiate an amendment to our existing credit facility 
as of december   we were in non monetary default as a result of our violation of certain financial covenants contained in our credit facility  although our lenders have not accelerated repayment on our outstanding debt 
all borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  are considered to be due on demand and accordingly are classified as a current liability at december  we are currently negotiating an amendment to the credit facility that  if agreed upon  will waive the outstanding defaults in exchange for limitations on our execution of new leases and capital expenditures  as well other financial covenants  increased interest rates and an amendment fee 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as has been our past practice  we will continue to evaluate the profitability  strategic positioning  impact of potential competition on and sales growth potential of all of our stores on an ongoing basis 
we may  from time to time  make decisions regarding closures  disposals  relocations or remodels in accordance with such evaluations 
as a result of such evaluations and as part of the strategic repositioning described below  in fiscal we closed operating grocery stores and two small vitamin stores and sold three stores in related transactions 
to date  in the first quarter of fiscal  we have closed one store identified for closure as part of the strategic repositioning described below  and are considering the sale or closure of as many as six more stores in the first half of fiscal restructuring charges  strategic repositioning 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we undertook an assessment of our inventory of operating and vacant properties as part of a strategic repositioning of the company 
we made certain decisions related to our operations which identified as many as ten stores to be sold or closed and resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of the ongoing assessment  we further determined that we would close or sell up to an additional eight stores whose performance did not meet company expectations 
as a result of this decision to close or sell additional stores  the company recorded an additional pre tax restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of march   the company has closed or sold of the stores identified for sale or closure 
as the result of customer research and internal assessments performed in fiscal  the company expanded the scope of its strategic repositioning and plans to spend up to million through fiscal for additional staff training  advertising  store and corporate office level staffing and other strategic initiatives designed to improve our store sales results 
results of operations 
our results of operations have been and will continue to be affected by  among other things  the number  timing and mix of store openings  acquisitions  relocations or closings 
new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection gradually and  as a result  generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than more mature stores 
we anticipate that the new stores opened in fiscal will experience operating losses for the first six to months of operation  in accordance with historical trends 
further  acquired stores  while generally profitable as of the acquisition date  generate lower gross margins and store contribution margins than our company average due to their substantially lower volume purchasing discounts and the integration of the acquired stores into our operating systems 
over time  we expect that the gross margin and store contribution margin of acquired stores approach our company average 
other factors that could cause acquired stores to perform at lower than expected levels include  among other things  turnover of regional and store management  disruption of advertising  changes in product mix and delays in the integration of purchasing programs 
the company continues to experience integration difficulties with certain of the stores acquired or added to our store base in fiscal  and as a result such stores are having a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we expect that these stores will take substantially longer to show gross margin and store contribution margin improvements 
as part of the company s strategic repositioning  we plan to increase advertising expenditures and staffing at some of our acquired stores to change prior practices that may have contributed to weaker than expected performance from such stores 
we are actively upgrading  remodeling or relocating some of our older stores 
we plan to complete the remodel or remerchandise as many as of our older stores in the first half of fiscal remodels and relocations typically cause short term disruption in sales volume and related increases in certain expenses as a percentage of sales  such as payroll 
remodels on average take between and days to complete 
certain remodels in fiscal took longer to complete  resulting in greater than projected sales disruptions 
we cannot predict whether sales disruptions and the related impact on earnings may be greater in time or volume than projected in certain remodeled or relocated stores 
store format and clustering strategy 
we operate two store formats natural foods supermarkets and farmers markets 
the natural foods supermarket format is generally  to  gross square feet  and the farmers markets are generally  to  gross square feet 
our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by the mix of natural foods supermarkets and farmers market stores opened  acquired or relocated and whether stores are being opened in markets where we have an existing presence 
as part of our strategic repositioning  we intend to increase the size of our natural foods supermarket stores over time to an average size of  to  square feet 
we are currently making revisions to our store format and design  including  among other things  expanding the average size of our natural foods supermarket format stores to an average of  to  square feet  expanding our selections of gourmet and crossover products  housewares  gift items  beer and wine  bakery and floral and redesigning store layouts and signage 
we also plan to expand the henry s marketplace r farmers market style store format as our second  parallel store format 
we believe this format  which is primarily located in the metropolitan san diego  california area  appeals to a more value conscious customer 
in the past  we have pursued a strategy of clustering stores in each of our markets to increase overall sales  reduce operating costs and increase customer awareness 
in prior years  when we opened a store in a market where we had an existing presence  our sales and operating results declined at certain of our existing stores in that market 
however  over time  the affected stores generally achieved store contribution margins comparable to prior levels on the lower base of sales 
certain new stores opened in fiscal and fiscal have caused a greater degree of cannibalization than previously expected  and at this time it does not appear that the store contribution margins at the older  affected stores in these regions will rebound to their prior levels 
in certain existing markets the sales and operating results trends for other stores may continue to experience temporary declines related to the clustering of stores 
we are currently reevaluating our clustering strategy in response to greater than expected sales cannibalization in certain existing markets where we opened new stores in fiscal comparable store sales results 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the thirteenth full month of operations for new  relocated and acquired stores 
a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales results  including  among others o the opening of stores by us or by our competitors in markets where we have existing stores o the relative proportion of new or relocated stores to mature stores o the timing of advertising and promotional events o store remodels o our ability to effectively execute our operating plans o changes in consumer preferences for natural foods products o availability of produce and other seasonal merchandise o general economic conditions 
past increases in comparable store sales may not be indicative of future performance 
our comparable store sales results have been negatively affected in the past by  among other factors  planned cannibalization  which is the loss of sales at an existing store when we open a new store nearby  resulting from the implementation of our store clustering strategy 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations store format and clustering strategy 
comparable store sales results were negatively affected in fiscal by planned cannibalization due to the openings in fiscal and fiscal of new or relocated stores in several of our existing markets  including  among others phoenix  arizona  san diego  california  kansas city and st 
louis  missouri  portland  oregon  albuquerque  new mexico  nashville  tennessee and salt lake city  utah 
for certain stores opened in fiscal and fiscal  we experienced a higher degree of cannibalization than in the past in markets where we expected higher demand for additional stores 
certain stores  such as the henry s marketplace r format stores  which depend heavily on produce sales  are more susceptible to sales fluctuations resulting from the availability and price of certain produce items 
in addition  in fiscal certain stores faced greater than expected competition both from other natural foods grocery stores and from increased natural foods offerings in conventional and gourmet grocery stores  which negatively affected comparable store sales results 
as a result of the higher degree of cannibalization  as well as reduced levels of marketing in certain regions  delays in remodels  increased competition in some regions  difficulty in properly executing our operating plans and other factors  comparable store sales decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal and for fiscal we expect comparable store sales results to be flat to low single digits for fiscal as a whole  with the results flat to slightly negative in the first half of the year and improving in the remainder of the year 
there can be no assurance that comparable store sales for any particular period will not decrease in the future 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses include labor  rent  utilities  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a store s opening 
pre opening expenses have averaged approximately  to  per store historically  although the amount per store may vary depending on the store format and whether the store is the first to be opened in a market  or is part of a cluster of stores in that market 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for costs of start up activities 
statement of position requires that pre opening costs be expensed as incurred 
statement of position is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the initial application should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we adopted statement of position in fiscal and recorded approximately  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of taxes  during fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of sales fiscal year ended sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit direct store expenses store contribution selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses merger and restructuring expenses income loss from operations interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss before cumulative effect of change in account principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal and each contained weeks of operations 
sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of two stores  the opening of new stores  and the relocation of three stores  as well as the inclusion of a full year of sales for the eight new stores opened  five stores relocated  and stores acquired in fiscal comparable store sales decreased for fiscal  as compared to a increase for fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the acquisition of two stores  the opening of new stores and the relocation of three stores 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to acquisition integration difficulties in oregon  massachusetts and texas 
direct store expenses 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in direct store expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores operated by the company 
as a percentage of sales  direct store expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the increased number of acquired and newly opened stores in late fiscal  acquisition integration difficulties and significant investments that the company has made in employee benefit programs  particularly expanded health insurance offerings 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to additions in the corporate and regional staff necessary to support the company s accelerated growth in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses remained constant at in fiscal from fiscal as part of the company s expanded strategic repositioning  we expect to spend additional funds on marketing at the national level  as well as increased corporate and regional support staffs 
as a result of these increased expenditures  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal pre opening expenses 
as previously discussed herein  in april  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of start up activities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in pre opening expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores opened 
as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses remained constant at due to the opening of new stores including three relocations in fiscal as compared to new stores including five relocations in fiscal merger and restructuring expenses 
merger and restructuring expenses for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal the expenses for consisted of two separate strategic repositioning efforts 
the first restructuring occurred during the second quarter of fiscal  when certain decisions were made relating to the strategic repositioning of our operations resulting in a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
these decisions included the closure of three natural food stores and one small vitamin store during the second quarter of fiscal million  the planned sale or closure of seven stores during the remainder of fiscal million  exit costs of previously closed or abandoned sites million  and the discontinuation of e commerce activities million 
components of the restructuring charge consist primarily of abandonment of fixed and intangible assets million  noncancelable lease obligations million  and write down of the company s long term equity investment in an e commerce business partner due to asset impairment million 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are non cash expenses 
in conjunction with the restructuring charge  the company recorded a liability of million for noncancelable lease obligations 
the second restructuring occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when the company expanded its strategic repositioning and  as part of such expansion  decided to close or sell up to an additional eight stores which were not meeting expectations 
this decision resulted in an additional pre tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million 
this restructuring charge consists primarily of costs associated with the abandonment of fixed and intangible assets million and noncancelable lease obligations million 
in conjunction with the restructuring charge  the company recorded a liability of million for noncancelable lease obligations 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note merger and restructuring expenses and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations store openings  closings  remodels  relocations and acquisitions 
the total restructuring charges in fiscal of million reflect a increase over fiscal restructuring charges of million  which primarily resulted from closure of two farm to market stores located in buffalo grove  illinois  and tempe  arizona million and the reallocation of corporate resources to service new and existing stores  rather than closed sites million 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million  from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  net interest expense increased to from in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increased borrowings on our line of credit to fund acquisitions  new stores  relocations and remodels 
interest expense may increase in the future as a result of increased borrowing and or an expected increase in the interest rate under our credit facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources below 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal contained weeks of operations as compared to weeks in fiscal sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of stores  the opening of eight new stores  and the relocation of five stores  as well as the inclusion of a full year of sales for the nine new stores opened and seven stores acquired in fiscal comparable store sales increased for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the acquisition of seventeen stores and the opening of eight new stores 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the maturation of the company s store base and the company s increasing volume purchase discounts 
direct store expenses 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in direct store expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores operated by the company 
as a percentage of sales  direct store expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the increased number of acquired and newly opened stores in fiscal over fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from in fiscal the increases are primarily attributable to additions in the corporate and regional staff necessary to support the company s growth 
in addition  the company moved its corporate office during the fourth quarter of fiscal to a larger facility to accommodate an increased support staff for its larger base of stores 
there is a full year of additional selling  general and administrative expenses for rent and utilities on the new facility in fiscal  as compared to one quarter in fiscal pre opening expenses 
as previously discussed herein  in april  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of start up activities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended january   decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in pre opening expenses is attributable to the decrease in the number of stores opened 
as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses decreased to from due to the opening of eight new stores in fiscal as compared to nine new stores in fiscal merger and restructuring expenses 
merger and restructuring expenses for the fiscal year ended january   were million  as compared to  in fiscal restructuring expenses of approximately million were recorded in the first quarter of fiscal as the result of certain decisions by our management regarding our operations and selected store closures 
the first decision was a change in our strategic direction with respect to our two farm to market stores located in buffalo grove  illinois  and tempe  arizona which resulted in restructuring expenses of million 
the second decision involved the reallocation of corporate resources to service new and existing stores  rather than closed sites which resulted in a merger and restructuring expense of million 
components of the restructuring charge consist primarily of noncancelable lease obligations through fiscal in the amount of million and abandonment of fixed and intangible assets in the amount of million 
there were also restructuring expenses of  during the third quarter of fiscal  and million during the fourth quarter fiscal  as a result of the poolings with henry s and sun harvest 
the components were primarily noncancelable lease obligations and professional fees 
the fiscal charge is attributed to employee severance costs  inventory and fixed asset write downs  and lease cancellation costs associated with two poolings of interests transactions during fiscal interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million  from  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  net interest expense increased to from less than in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increased borrowings on our line of credit to fund acquisitions and new stores 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  trade payables  bank indebtedness  and the sale of equity securities 
primary uses of cash have been the financing of new store development  new store openings  relocations  remodels and acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal cash from operating activities decreased during this period primarily due to decreases in net income offset by merger and restructuring expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal and million during fiscal cash from operating activities increased during this period primarily due to increases in net income before depreciation and amortization expense and merger and restructuring expenses 
we have not required significant external financing to support inventory requirements at our existing and new stores because we have been able to rely on vendor financing for most of the inventory costs  and we anticipate that vendor financing will continue to be available for new store openings 
net cash used by investing activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during the same period in fiscal the decrease is due to the opening of new stores  the acquisition of two stores  the relocation of three stores and several store remodels in fiscal  as compared to eight new stores  five relocated stores  acquired stores and several store remodels in fiscal net cash used by investing activities was million during fiscal due to the acquisition of seven stores  the opening of nine new stores  the relocation of one store  and construction costs incurred for new stores in development that opened during net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal the decrease reflects lower incremental borrowings under our revolving line of credit to fund fewer store acquisitions during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal and net cash used by financing activities was million during fiscal the increase reflects increased borrowing under our revolving line of credit related to acquisition activity  as well as repayment of million in debt 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we renewed and increased our existing revolving credit facility to million 
the facility as increased and amended has two separate lines of credit  a revolving line for million and the remainder in a term loan facility  each with a three year term expiring august  the facility currently bears interest at the default rate  which is the prime rate 
the credit agreement includes certain financial and other covenants  as well as restrictions on payments of dividends 
as of december   we were in violation of two financial covenants  and the lending group issued a notice of default  although it has not accelerated our repayment obligations 
all borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  are considered to be due on demand and accordingly are classified as a current liability at december  as a result of the covenant violations  our borrowings under the credit facility have been limited to million 
we are currently negotiating an amendment to the credit facility to waive the defaults and modify certain of the covenants that may include an increase in our interest rate and certain limitations on the execution of new leases and capital expenditures  as well as other financial covenants and a security interest in certain of our assets 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating an amendment acceptable to our lenders  such lenders could accelerate repayment of existing borrowings 
the company currently does not have sufficient available funds to repay in the event of an acceleration of our debt 
the company is also proposing to raise approximately million in equity financings to provide additional liquidity 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving facility and million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan 
if we are successful in negotiating an amendment to our existing credit facility  we believe that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure requirements in fiscal we spent approximately million during fiscal for new store construction  development  remodels and maintenance capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions  and anticipate that we will spend to million in fiscal for new store construction  equipment  leasehold improvements  remodels and maintenance capital expenditures and relocations of existing stores  exclusive of acquisitions 
our average capital expenditures to open a leased store  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures  have ranged from approximately to million historically  excluding inventory costs and initial operating losses 
we anticipate that our average capital expenditures will be to million in the future  partly because of increases in the size of new stores and partly because our new store prototype requires more expensive fixturing 
delays in opening new stores may result in increased capital expenditures and increased pre opening costs for the site  as well as lower than planned sales for the company 
we anticipate cash flows from operations of approximately million in fiscal although there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels  we believe that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital expenditure requirements through fiscal in fiscal we sold certain unimproved real property acquired as part of the acquisition of the outstanding stock of nature s fresh northwest and an office building acquired as part of the pooling of interests transaction with sun harvest farms  inc  both in fiscal the cost of initial inventory for a new store is approximately  to  depending on the store format  however  we obtain vendor financing for most of this cost 
pre opening costs currently are approximately  to  per store and are expensed as incurred 
the amounts and timing of such pre opening costs will depend upon the availability of new store sites and other factors  including the location of the store and whether it is in a new or existing market for us  the size of the store  and the required build out at the site 
costs to acquire future stores  if any  are impossible to predict and could vary materially from the cost to open new stores 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels 
we believe that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  exclusive of additional acquisitions  through fiscal new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the value of foreign currency 
the company employs various financial instruments to manage certain exposures when practical 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company owns and operates four natural foods supermarkets and a commissary kitchen in british columbia  canada 
the commissary supports the four canadian stores and does not independently generate sales revenue 
sales made from the four canadian stores are made in exchange for canadian dollars 
to the extent that those revenues are repatriated to the united states  the amounts repatriated are subject to the exchange rate fluctuations between the two currencies 
the company does not hedge against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt issued under its million revolving credit facility 
the facility has two separate lines of credit  a revolving line in the amount of million and a term loan in the amount of million  each with a three year term expiring august  as a result of violations by the company of certain financial covenants under the line of credit facility  the company s lenders issued a notice of default  although the lenders have not accelerated repayment of outstanding borrowings at this time 
all borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  are considered to be due on demand and accordingly are classified as a current liability at december  borrowings under the credit facility have been limited to million 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the million revolving line of this facility and million in borrowings outstanding under the million term note 
as a result of the company s default  the interest rate on the credit facility was adjusted to the prime rate  effective december  the company is currently negotiating an amendment to the credit facility that would retroactively adjust interest rates to a variable rate based on the prime rate or libor  effective january  because the interest rates on these facilities are variable  based upon the prime rate or libor  if the company is successful in negotiating an amendment to the facility  the company s interest expense and net income are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the result  based upon the existing outstanding debt as of december   would be an annual increase or decrease of approximately million in interest expense and a corresponding decrease or increase of approximately  in the company s net income after taxes 
in september  the company entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure on variable rate debt positions 
variable rates are predominantly linked to libor as determined by one month intervals 
the interest rate provided by the swap on variable rate debt is 
at december   the notional principal amount at the interest rate swap agreement was million  expiring in august the notional amount is the amount used for the calculation of interest payments which are exchanged over the life of the swap transaction on the amortized principal balance 
in fiscal  the gains losses in interest expense associated with this agreement were approximately
