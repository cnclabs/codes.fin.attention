item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under the heading business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading supplier of flash memory semiconductor devices for the digital consumer  networking  wireless communication and internet computing markets 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
downturns of this type occurred in  and these downturns have been characterized by weakening product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
we recently began to experience a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
to date  market conditions have not improved during early and our customers have continued to return product  cancel backlog and or push out shipments 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
we derived of our product revenues for and of our product revenues during from product shipments to asia 
additionally  all of our major wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
during and  several asian countries where we do business  including japan  taiwan and korea  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted our revenues and  therefore  our ability to collect payments from these customers 
in september  taiwan experienced a major earthquake 
the resulting disruption to the manufacturing operations in the wafer foundries and assembly and testing subcontractors that we use in taiwan harmed our revenues and operating results during the third and fourth quarters of our product sales are made primarily using short term cancelable purchase orders 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as shipment schedules  are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs and in our supply of product 
accordingly  our backlog of open purchase orders at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
changes in the amount of our backlog do not necessarily reflect a corresponding change in the level of actual or potential sales 
sales to customers and foreign stocking representatives are recognized upon shipment  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold to customers 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  we defer recognition of such revenues  related costs of revenues and related gross margin until we are notified by the distributor that the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
most of our technology licenses provide for the payment of up front license fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
for license and other arrangements for technology that we are continuing to enhance and refine and under which we are obligated to provide unspecified enhancements  revenue is recognized over the lesser of the estimated period we have historically enhanced and developed refinements to the technology  generally three years  the upgrade period  or the remaining portion of the upgrade period from the date of delivery  provided all specified technology and documentation has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
from time to time  we reexamine the estimated upgrade period relating to licensed technology to determine if a change in the estimated update period is needed 
revenues from license or other technology arrangements where we are not continuing to enhance and refine the technology or are not obligated to provide unspecified enhancements is recognized upon delivery  if the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
we recognize royalties received under these arrangements during the upgrade period as revenue based on the ratio of the elapsed portion of the upgrade period to the estimated upgrade period 
we recognize the remaining portion of the royalties ratably over the remaining portion of the upgrade period 
we recognize royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed when reported to us  which generally coincides with the receipt of payment 
results of operations years ended december    and net revenues net revenues were million in compared to million in and million in the increase from both to and from to was due to increased shipment volume of new and existing products and due to our ability to raise prices slightly in the second half of and average selling prices fluctuate due to a number of factors including the overall supply and demand for our products in the marketplace  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
we experienced a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
to date  market conditions have not improved during early and customers have continued to return product  cancel backlog  and or push out shipments 
product revenues 
product revenues were million in  million in and million in the increase from both to and from to was primarily due to shipments of new products introduced in the second half of and during and shipping volumes fluctuate due to overall industry supply and demand 
product revenues decreased slightly on a quarterly basis during the fourth quarter of due to lower shipping levels and increases in sales return reserves during the fourth quarter 
our allowance for sales returns increased million due primarily to anticipated product returns related to changing market conditions at the end of license revenues 
revenues from license fees and royalties were million in  million in and million in the increase from to was primarily due to million in license fee received as part of a legal settlement 
we anticipated another million to be paid under this legal settlement in each quarter of the increase from to was primarily due to recognition of up front fees paid by licensees and an increase in the number of licensees from we anticipate that license revenues will fluctuate significantly in the future 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of net revenues  in  million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in gross profit increased across all periods due to increased shipments of existing cost reduced products  increased shipments of new  higher margin products  and increased average selling prices on both older and newer products 
we also wrote down million of inventory related to products that we determined to be excess or obsolete during operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared to million or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to increased profit sharing with employees  increased commissions  and increased salaries and benefits due to hiring additional personnel 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to increased commissions and increased salaries and benefits due to hiring additional personnel 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  sales and marketing and to general and administrative  and that these expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  quality assurance activities and occupancy costs 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and the cost of materials such as wafers and masks 
research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  during  as compared to million  or of net revenues  during and million  or of net revenues during research and development expenses increased from primarily due to an million expense for profit sharing and expenses related to increased engineering headcount  materials costs and occupancy costs 
research and development expenses increased from due to increased personnel costs  consisting of salaries  payroll taxes  and benefits  increased wafer  mask and tooling charges for new product development  and increased occupancy costs 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions to stocking representatives  personnel costs  and occupancy costs  as well as travel and entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenues  in as compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  during sales and marketing expenses in increased from and increased in from due to increased commissions owed on higher product revenues  increased personnel costs  and increased building occupancy costs due to the lease of additional space 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  fluctuations in revenues will cause fluctuations in sales and marketing expense as it impacts our commissions expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries for administrative  executive and finance personnel  recruiting costs  professional services and legal fees and allowances for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net revenues  in as compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  during expenses increased from to due to increased legal  personnel  occupancy expenses and depreciation expense associated with our new oracle erp system  which we implemented in january general and administrative expenses decreased from million to million from to due to the reversal of certain legal accruals associated with the settlement of our lawsuit with intel in our allowance for bad debt increased  due to the increase of our accounts receivable from to we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amount as we scale our facilities  infrastructure  and head count to support our overall expected growth 
we may also incur additional expenses in connection with the atmel litigation 
for further information on this litigation see legal proceedings 
in process research and development charge 
a charge of million  or of net revenues  in  relates to the expense for in process research and development incurred during the acquisition of agate semiconductor inc refer also to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of agate s patents  workforce  and the technology currently under development was determined by an independent appraiser using the income approach for the patents and technology and the cost approach for the workforce 
the income approach discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward by a premium of to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
we believe that the pricing model related to this acquisition is consistent within the high technology industry 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of the expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
in process research and development valued at million consisted of a single project to develop a high density multiple bit per cell flash memory chip targeted for high capacity  low cost applications such as digital cameras  mp players  cellular telephones and pagers 
at the time of the acquisition the estimated cost to complete the project was to million and the chip was approximately complete 
the risk adjusted discount rate relating to in process technology determined by the independent appraiser to be 
we expect that the multiple bit per cell chip will be completed and begin to generate cash flows within to months from the date of the acquisition 
however  development of the multiple bit per cell remains a significant risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the multiple bit per cell chip into a commercially viable product consists principally of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the multiple bit per cell chip can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring the multiple bit per cell chip to market in a timely manner could result in a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenues and net income from the multiple bit per cell chip will negatively impact the return on the investment expected at the time of the acquisition and potentially result in impairment of other assets related to the development activities 
a charge of million  or of net revenues  in  relates to the expense for in process research and development incurred during the acquisition of linvex technology corporation 
refer also to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of linvex core technology  existing products  as well as the technology currently under development was determined by an independent appraiser using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward by a premium of to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
we expect that the pricing model related to this acquisition will be considered standard within the high technology industry 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
in process research and development valued at million consisted of a single project to combine flash and sram memory on a single chip the combomemory chip 
at the time of the acquisition the estimated cost to complete the combomemory chip was million and the chip was approximately complete 
the risk adjusted discount rate relating to in process technology was 
during late and early  the combomemory chip was completed and began to generate cash flows 
however  if we fail to achieve the expected levels of revenues and net income from the combomemory chip  this could negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time of the acquisition and potentially result in impairment of other assets related to the development activities 
actions and comments regarding other companies from the securities and exchange commission have indicated that they are reviewing the current valuation methodology of purchased in process research and development relating to acquisitions 
the commission is concerned that some companies are writing off more of the value of an acquisition than is appropriate 
we believe that we are in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist 
however  the commission may seek to reduce the amount of purchased in process research and development we have previously expensed 
this would result in the restatement of our previously filed financial statement and could have a material negative impact on the financial results for the period subsequent to the acquisition 
interest income 
interest income was approximately million  or of net revenues  during  as compared to  or of net revenues  during  and million  or of net revenues  during interest income increased from to due to the receipt of cash proceeds from a follow on public offering and private placement  which closed on march   and the underwriters exercise of an over allotment option which closed april  interest income decreased from to due to a decrease in cash during that period 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  during as compared to  during and  during interest expense relates to borrowing prior to the completion of a follow on public offering and to fee activity under our line of credit 
interest expense increased each year due to increased borrowing under our line of credit 
interest expense charges will continue in order to maintain the line of credit facility 
other income  net 
other income of  in consists primarily of the receipt of a dividend of approximately  from an investee company during the fourth quarter of provision for benefit from income taxes the provision for benefit from income taxes was approximately million in  approximately  in and  in during  we created a valuation allowance because the cumulative net operating losses incurred exceeded the amount of tax carry back available 
during we reversed the entire allowance 
this reversal was due to our increased earnings and was based on management s assessment that it is more likely than not that all the net deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
segment reporting our business has two reportable segments flash products and technology licensing 
flash products comprise our standard memory products  our application specific memory products  flash embedded controllers  mass storage products and special products 
technology licensing comprises design service fees  technical consultation fees  license fees and royalties earned through technology agreements that we have with wafer foundries and manufacturers for non competing applications

 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date until the first fiscal year beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas sfas no 
amends certain terms and conditions of sfas sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recognized at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
we will adopt sfas no 
 as amended  in our quarter ending march  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
cash provided by operations was million in and relates primarily to net income of million offset by accounts receivable increase of million and an increase in accounts receivable from related parties of million  all due to increased sales in increases in trade accounts payable of million  trade payables to related parties of million  and accrued expenses of million and deferred revenue of million were offset by increases in inventory of million and increases in other current and noncurrent assets of million 
cash used in operations was million in and relates primarily to the increase in accounts receivable and accounts receivable from related parties of million and the increase in inventories of million due to the production ramp  offset in part by an million increase in trade accounts payable 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities of million during consisted primarily of investments of cash in available for sale marketable securities 
we also made strategic equity investments in privately held companies which are either subcontractors to our production process or customers  we also acquired equipment  invested in enterprise resource planning software  and made leasehold improvements 
cash used in investing activities during consisted primarily of million to acquire test equipment  furniture and fixtures 
planned capital spending for is currently approximately million to be used primarily for test equipment and design engineering tools for research and development  information systems infrastructure  and leasehold improvements 
on march   we invested million in shanghai grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation gsmc 
gmsc is a foreign funded wafer foundry project and will be located in shanghai  prc financing activities 
our financing activities provided cash of approximately million during the cash provided was primarily from the issuance of common stock for million and primarily relates to net proceeds from a follow on public offering in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock  a private placement in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock  and million from common stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options  offset by the repayment of our entire line of credit at the end of march  cash provided by financing activities during consisted primarily of borrowings under the line of credit of million offset by payments of million under that same line 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities and the line of credit 
as of december  we had no borrowing on our line of credit as this credit facility was paid off during march  however we continue to have access to this facility should we need it 
as of december   our line of credit was for million 
this agreement expires in september borrowing is limited to of eligible world wide accounts receivable and is also reduced by any letters of credit issued under a million subagreement to this line 
therefore  as of december   our actual credit available under this line was approximately million 
the line bears interest at a rate of the bank s reference rate at december  plus 
there is a minimum interest rate of 
we are required to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth 
under the agreement we are not permitted to pay a dividend 
we must pay an unused line fee at the annual rate of one quarter of one percent on the unused portion 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of this agreement 
subsequent to december  the line of credit was increased to million 
purchase commitments 
we have committed to pay million in  subject to certain business conditions  to secure increased wafer capacity in and we believe that our cash balances  together with funds expected to be generated from operations and the line of credit availability  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional borrowings or capital and  if so required  that such borrowing or capital will be available on acceptable terms 
business risks risks related to our business our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenues may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our recent growth may not be sustainable  and you should not use our past financial performance to predict future operating results 
although we were profitable in  we incurred net losses in fiscal  and our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are out of our control o the availability  timely delivery and cost of wafers from our suppliers  o competitive pricing pressures and related changes in selling prices  o fluctuations in manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  o new product announcements and introductions of competing products by us or our competitors  o product obsolescence  o lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  o changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  o the gain or loss of significant customers  o market acceptance of products utilizing our superflash r technology  o changes in the channels through which our products are distributed and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  o exchange rate fluctuations  o general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  o difficulties in forecasting  planning and management of inventory levels  o unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and o the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue 
a downturn in the market for products such as personal computers and cellular telephones that incorporate our products can also harm our operating results 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our revenue projections 
we may experience revenue shortfalls for the following reasons o sudden drops in consumer demand which causes customers to cancel backlog  push out shipment schedules  or reduce new orders  possibly due to a slowing economy or inventory corrections among our customers  o significant declines in selling prices that occur because of competitive price pressure during an over supply market environment  o sudden shortages of raw materials or fabrication  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations  and o the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 
in addition  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside suppliers and foundries  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
cancellations or rescheduling of backlog may result in lower future revenue and harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
we experienced a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
to date  market conditions have not improved during early and our customers have continued to return product  cancel backlog and or push out shipments 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
we depend on a limited number of foreign foundries to manufacture our products  and these foundries may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we outsource all of our manufacturing with the exception of limited testing activities 
we currently buy all of our wafers and sorted die from a limited number of suppliers 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by four foundries  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd  in taiwan  sanyo electric co  ltd  in japan  seiko epson corp 
in japan  and samsung electronics ltd 
in korea 
we anticipate that these foundries  together with national semiconductor corporation in the united states and vanguard international semiconductor corporation in taiwan  will manufacture the majority of our products in on march   we invested million in shanghai grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation gsmc 
gmsc is a foreign funded wafer foundry project which will be located in shanghai  prc if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis and at competitive prices we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of revenues or higher than anticipated costs of revenues  any of which could harm our operating results 
our revenues may be impacted by our ability to obtain adequate wafer supplies from our foundries 
the foundries with which we currently have arrangements  together with any additional foundry at which capacity might be obtained  may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices 
in addition  we have encountered delays in qualifying new products and in ramping new product production and could experience these delays in the future 
we are also subject to the risks of service disruptions  raw material shortages and price increases by the foundries 
such disruptions  shortages and price increases could harm our operating results 
if we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity  our revenues may decline 
in order to grow  we need to increase our present manufacturing capacity 
events that we have not foreseen could arise which would limit our capacity 
we are continually engaged in attempting to secure additional manufacturing capacity to support our long term growth 
in the longer term we may determine that it is necessary to invest substantial capital in order to secure appropriate production capacity commitments 
if we cannot secure additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired and our operating results will be harmed 
our cost of revenues may increase if we are required to purchase manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing if we need substantial capital in order to secure this capacity and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from marginal design or manufacturing process drift 
yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process  which often makes them difficult  time consuming and costly to correct 
furthermore we rely on independent foreign foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability  which would harm our operating results 
if our foundries discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays and lower revenues 
our wafer and product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production on an older or lower volume manufacturing process that it uses to produce our parts 
additionally  we cannot be certain our foundries will continue to devote resources to advance the process technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
each of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher costs of materials 
we depend on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks o reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  o the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  o difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  o limited warranties on products supplied to us  o potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  and o potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
these risks may lead to increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
because our flash memory products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
due to the flash memory product cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could harm sales of our products 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor memory components and have recently added significant capacity for such production 
our memory products  which presently account for substantially all of our revenues  compete principally against products offered by intel  advanced micro devices  atmel  stmicroelectronics  sanyo  winbond electronics and macronix 
if we are successful in developing our high density products  these products will compete principally with products offered by intel  advanced micro devices  fujitsu  hitachi  sharp  samsung semiconductor  sandisk and toshiba  as well as any new entrants to the market 
in addition  we may in the future experience direct competition from our foundry partners 
we have licensed to our foundry partners the right to fabricate products based on our technology and circuit design  and to sell such products worldwide  subject to our receipt of royalty payments 
competition may also come from alternative technologies such as ferroelectric random access memory  or fram  or other developing technologies 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by o rapidly changing technologies  o evolving and competing industry standards  o changing customer needs  o frequent new product introductions and enhancements  o increased integration with other functions  and o rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products and ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we believe that products for these applications will encounter intense competition and be highly price sensitive 
while we are currently developing and introducing new products for these applications  we cannot assure you that these products will reach the market on time  will satisfactorily address customer needs  will be sold in high volume  or will be sold at profitable margins 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional personnel 
we are highly dependent on bing yeh  our president and chief executive officer  as well as the other principal members of our management team and engineering staff 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular the highly skilled design  applications and test engineers involved in the development of flash memory technology 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our corporate headquarters is located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secrets  copyrights  mask work rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
we own patents in the united states relating to our products and processes  and have filed for several more 
in addition  we hold several patents in europe and canada  and have filed several foreign patent applications in europe  japan  korea  taiwan and canada 
we cannot assure you that any pending patent application will be granted 
our operating results could be harmed by the failure to protect our intellectual property 
if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties may assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
over the past three years we were sued both by atmel corporation and intel corporation regarding patent infringement issues and by winbond electronics corporation regarding our contractual relationship with them 
significant management time and financial resources have been devoted to defending these lawsuits 
we settled with intel in may  with winbond in october  and the atmel litigation is ongoing 
in addition to the atmel  intel and winbond actions  we receive from time to time  letters or communications from other companies stating that such companies have patent rights which involve our products 
since the design of all of our products is based on superflash technology  any legal finding that the use of our superflash technology infringes the patent of another company would have a significantly negative effect on our entire product line and operating results 
furthermore  if such a finding were made  there can be no assurance that we could license the other company s technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we could successfully operate without such technology 
moreover  if we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages to the owner of the protected technology and could be prohibited from making  using  selling  or importing into the united states any products that infringe the protected technology 
in addition  the management attention consumed by and legal cost associated with any litigation could harm our operating results 
public announcements may hurt our stock price 
during the course of lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
our litigation may be expensive  may be protracted and confidential information may be compromised 
whether or not we are successful in our lawsuit with atmel  we expect this litigation to consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
at any time atmel may file additional claims against us  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigation 
further  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
during  and  our export product and licensing revenues accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues  respectively 
our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  each of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would harm our operating results 
these risks include o difficulties in complying with regulatory requirements and standards  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  o reliance on third parties to distribute our products  o longer accounts receivable payment cycles  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o limits on repatriation of earnings  and o burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
we derived and of our product revenue from asia during and  respectively 
additionally  our major wafer suppliers and assembly and packaging subcontractors are all located in asia 
any kind of economic  political or environmental instability in this region of the world can have a severe negative impact on our operating results due to the large concentration of our production and sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian countries where we do business  such as japan  taiwan and korea  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted our total revenues and also negatively impacted our ability to collect payments from these customers 
during this period  the lack of capital in the financial sectors of these countries made it difficult for our customers to open letters of credit or other financial instruments that are guaranteed by foreign banks 
finally  the economic situation in this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
it should also be noted that we are greatly impacted by the political  economic and military conditions in taiwan 
taiwan and china are continuously engaged in political disputes and both countries have continued to conduct military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue and even escalate  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping or even military hostilities 
any of these events could delay production or shipment of our products 
any kind of activity of this nature or even rumors of such activity could harm our operations  revenues  operating results  and stock price 
because a small number of customer accounts are responsible for a substantial portion of our revenues  our revenues could decline due to the loss of one of these customer accounts 
in the past  more than half of our revenues have come from a small number of customer accounts 
for example  product sales to our top customer accounts represented approximately  and of our product revenues for  and  respectively 
during  of our top accounts were stocking representatives  two were domestic distributors and one was an oem 
in  one customer account represented of product sales 
another customer account represented and of product sales in and  respectively 
no single customer account represented or more of product revenues during if we were to lose any of these customer accounts or experience any substantial reduction in orders from these customer accounts  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
in addition  the composition of our major customer account base changes from year to year as the market demand for our end customers products change 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and the loss of a major customer could harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
an early termination by one of our major customers would harm our financial results as it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly replace that revenue source 
if an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility or those of our suppliers  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenues 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of our major suppliers  like the one that occurred in taiwan in september  could disrupt the operations of those suppliers  which could limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
prolonged electrical power outages or shortages  or increased costs of energy could harm our business 
our design and process research and development facilities and our corporate offices are located in california  which is currently susceptible to power outages and shortages as well as increased eneregy costs 
to limit this exposure  we are in the process of securing back up generators and power supplies to our main california facilities 
while the majority of our production facilities are not located in california  more extensive power shortages in the state could delay our design and process research and development as well as increase our operating costs 
we depend on stocking representatives and distributors to generate a majority of our revenues 
we rely on stocking representatives and distributors to establish and maintain customer relationships and  at times  to sell our products and these accounts could discontinue their relationship with us or discontinue selling our products at any time 
two of our stocking representatives are responsible for relationships with customers which account for substantially all of our product sales in taiwan  which were and of our net product revenues during and one stocking representative was responsible for relationships with customers which accounted for substantially all of our sales in china  including hong kong  during and  which accounted for and of our total product revenues during and  respectively 
the loss of any of these stocking representatives  or any other significant stocking representative or distributor could harm our operating results by impairing our ability to sell our products to these customers 
our growth continues to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market and sell our products and develop new products may he harmed 
our business is experiencing rapid growth which has strained our internal systems and will require us to continuously develop sophisticated information management systems in order to manage the business effectively 
we are currently implementing a supply chain management system and a vendor electronic data interface system 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement these new systems in a timely fashion  that in themselves they will be adequate to address our expected growth  or that we will be able to foresee in a timely manner other infrastructure needs before they arise 
our success depends on the ability of our executive officers to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations will be harmed 
if we fail to successfully implement new management information systems  our business may suffer severe inefficiencies that may harm the results of our operations 
risks related to our industry our success is dependent on the growth and strength of the flash memory market 
all of our products  as well as all new products currently under design  are stand alone flash memory devices or devices embedded with flash memory 
a memory technology other than superflash may be adopted as an industry standard 
our competitors are generally in a better financial and marketing position than we are from which to influence industry acceptance of a particular memory technology 
in particular  a primary source of competition may come from alternative technologies such as fram devices if such technology is commercialized for higher density applications 
to the extent our competitors are able to promote a technology other than superflash as an industry standard  our business will be seriously harmed 
the selling prices for our products are extremely volatile and have historically declined during periods of over capacity or industry downturns 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry could create fluctuations in our operating results  as we experienced in and the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
downturns of this type occurred in and these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
the flash memory products portion of the semiconductor industry  from which we derive substantially all of our revenues  continued to suffer from excess capacity in  and  which resulted in greater than normal declines in our markets  which unfavorably impacted our revenues  gross margins and profitability 
while these conditions improved in and  deteriorating market conditions at the end of and early could result in the eventual decline of our selling prices and  if such declines were to resume  our growth and operating results would be harmed 
there is seasonality in our business and if we fail to continue to introduce new products this seasonality may become more pronounced 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics applications market are subject to seasonality 
as a result  sales of these products are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of each year 
in and the first half of  this seasonality was partially offset by the introduction of new products as we continued to diversify our product offerings 
if we fail to continue to introduce new products  our business may suffer and the seasonality of a portion of our sales may become more pronounced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce revenues and or result in operating losses 
in addition  a downturn in the japanese economy could impair the value of our investment in our japanese affiliate  silicon technology  co  ltd 
if we consider the value of this affiliate in which we have a interest  to be impaired  we would write off  or expense  some or all of our approximately  investment 
similarly  a downturn in the economy of taiwan could impair the value of equity investments made there  which totaled million at december  at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could effect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  any interest expense owed on the line of credit facility  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures
