item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes some forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
words such as estimates  expects  anticipates  plans  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the ongoing restructuring of the electric and gas industries and the outcome of regulatory proceedings related to that restructuring 
the ultimate impacts of both increased competition and the changing regulatory environment on future results are uncertain  but are expected to fundamentally change how puget energy and pse conduct their business 
the outcome of these changes and other matters discussed below may cause future results to differ materially from historic results  or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by puget energy and pse 
puget energy was established as the holding company for pse on january  pursuant to a plan of exchange in which each share of pse common stock was exchanged on a one for one basis for puget energy common stock 
the following discussion and analysis relates to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes 
the financial statements include the accounts of pse and all wholly owned subsidiaries and  therefore  also represents the consolidated financial statements of puget energy 
financial condition and results of operations net income in was million on operating revenues of billion  compared to million on operating revenues of billion in and million on operating revenues of billion in income for common stock was million in  compared to million in and million in basic and diluted earnings per share in were on million weighted average common shares outstanding compared to on million weighted average common shares outstanding in and on million weighted average common shares outstanding in net income in was positively impacted by an increase in margins related to electric and gas operations 
net income in was positively impacted by net gains of approximately million or per share from non utility operations 
the per share included gains from the sale of homeguard security services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  and pse s common stock investment in cabot oil gas corporation 
these gains were offset in part by losses related to sales of non core assets and gas transportation contracts  establishing reserves for two proposed small hydro electric projects by hydro energy development corp 
and costs of connext exiting certain product lines 
total kilowatt hour sales to ultimate consumers in were billion compared with billion in and billion in kilowatt hour sales to wholesale customers were billion in  billion in and billion in total gas volumes  including gas sales  service and transportation  were  million therms in   million therms in and  million therms in increase decrease over preceding year years ended december dollars in millions operating revenues general rate increases bpa residential purchase and sale agreement electric sales to other utilities and marketers electric revenue sold at index rates electric revenue sold to conservation trust electric load and other changes gas revenue change infrastrux revenues other revenues total operating revenue changes  operating expenses energy costs purchased electricity residential exchange purchased gas electric generation fuel utility operations and maintenance 
infrastrux operations and maintenance other operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization conservation amortization taxes other than federal income taxes federal income taxes total operating expense changes  other income interest charges net income changes the following information pertains to the changes outlined in the table above operating revenues electric electric operating revenues increased million and million in and  respectively  when compared to the prior years due to overall average general rate increases effective january  and january  electric revenues in increased significantly due to increased prices related to electric energy sales to other utilities and marketers and sales to customers whose rates are tied to a market index 
several factors  including unfavorable hydro conditions  unscheduled outages of generating facilities in california  and increased consumer demand have raised wholesale market prices on the west coast to unprecedented levels beginning in the second half of pse  to date  has protected its core customers from the negative impact of the volatile west coast power markets through its effective management of its energy supply resources and its efficient operation of its distribution system 
on december   certain industrial customers who receive electric service under a market index based tariff filed a complaint with the washington commission seeking emergency relief from this tariff 
these and other industrial customers had demanded the market index based tariff in return for supporting pse s merger with washington natural gas company 
on december   pse filed a petition requesting that pse be allowed to defer and recover any lost revenue resulting from any relief granted to these customers 
the washington commission held a number of hearings on this subject and on january   while concluding no emergency relief was warranted  ordered continued hearings as to whether and how some relief in the form of a soft price cap could be temporarily put in place for these customers 
pse immediately filed testimony with the washington commission detailing the significant adverse financial impact of such a proposal at rate cap levels being contemplated to per megawatt hour 
pse also filed suit in king county superior court against certain of the customers seeking damages for their attempt to void their agreements to buy electricity under the market index based tariffs 
subsequent to those actions  the washington commission suspended the hearings to allow all parties to work on a settlement 
the settlement proposal  which currently is being finalized in writing  would result in a significant portion of the industrial loads in question in excess of average megawatts being expected to purchase electricity from other suppliers and in return give up any rights to pse s embedded cost resources 
customers representing a small portion of the load approximately average megawatts have the opportunity to transfer to a tariff with a new small customer rate schedule 
it is expected that the settlement proposal will be submitted to the washington commission in march electric revenues in and were reduced because of the credit that pse received through the residential purchase and sale agreement with the bonneville power administration bpa 
this agreement enables pse s residential and small farm customers to receive the benefits of lower cost federal power 
on january   pse and the bpa signed a residential exchange termination agreement 
the termination agreement ends pse s participation in the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa 
as part of the termination agreement  pse will receive payments by the bpa of approximately million over an approximately five year period ending june these payments are recorded as a reduction of purchased electricity expenses 
under the rate plan approved by the washington commission in its merger order  pse will continue to reflect  in customers bills  the level of residential exchange benefits in place at the time of the merger 
over the remainder of the residential exchange termination agreement from january through june  it is projected that pse will credit customers approximately million more than it will receive from bpa 
the allocation of future benefits of low cost federal power  for the five year bpa rate plan period to  will be decided as part of a current bpa rate case process 
in may  the bpa published an initial record of decision in its subscription process 
bpa allocated benefits intended to be equivalent to average mw of cost based federal power to the residential and small farm customers of the pacific northwest investor owned utilities ious 
the regional public utility commissions in turn recommended an allocation of the benefits among the ious  with pse s proposed annual share equal to average mw of benefits over the five year period october through september in august  the bpa determined that certain aspects of its initial record of decision would be revisited in its power rate case that is expected to continue through may on october   pse signed a five year contract with the bpa as required by bpa s subscription timeline for receipt of the federal power benefits allocated by the subscription and commission processes 
the contract describes the form power and cash of the average mw benefits to be provided  and provides pse a right to terminate the contract upon completion of bpa s rate case 
the results of the case will affect the value of benefits actually received by pse and other northwest ious from the subscription benefits allocation process 
electric revenues in and were reduced by million and million  respectively  when compared to prior years as a result of pse s sale of revenues associated with million of its investment in conservation assets to grantor trusts 
the revenue decrease represents the portion of rate revenues that were sold and forwarded to the trusts 
the impact of this revenue decrease  however  was offset by related reductions in other utility operations and maintenance and interest expenses 
to meet customer demand  pse s power supply portfolio includes net purchases of power under long term supply contracts 
however  depending principally upon streamflow available for hydro electric generation and weather effects on customer demand  from time to time  pse may have surplus power available for sale to wholesale customers 
in addition  pse has increased its wholesale surplus power business in order to manage its core energy portfolio through short and intermediate term purchases  sales  arbitrage and other risk management techniques 
pse has a risk management committee which oversees energy price risk matters 
sales to other utilities and marketers increased million and million in and  respectively  compared to the prior years due primarily to an increase in sales volumes and  for  large increases in wholesale power prices 
pse operates within the western wholesale market and has made sales into the california energy market 
at december   pse s current receivables from the california independent system operators caiso and other counterparties  net of reserves  is million 
operating revenues gas regulated gas utility revenues in increased by million from the prior year on a increase in gas volumes sold 
total gas volumes  including transported gas  decreased in from the primary reason for the increase in gas sales was the higher natural gas prices which are passed through to customers in the purchased gas adjustment pga 
increases under the pga were effective november  and august  as a result of the pga increases  gas rates to all sales customers increased by an average of on november  and on august  a larger percentage of firm gas sales with higher prices and less transportation volumes in when compared to last year also contributed to increased revenues 
utility gas margin the difference between gas revenues and gas purchases increased by million  or  in over regulated gas utility sales revenue in increased by million from the prior year on a increase in gas volumes sold 
total gas volumes  including transported gas  increased in from other revenues infrastrux provided total operating revenues of million in from the acquisitions they made in the third quarter 
pse s other revenues decreased million in compared to primarily due to decreased revenues at pse s real estate investment and development subsidiary  puget western  inc  and the sale of a wholly owned subsidiary  homeguard security services  inc in other revenues decreased million in compared to due primarily to decreased revenues at pse s customer information and billing software development and marketing subsidiary  connext 
operating expenses purchased electricity expenses increased million in when compared to and million in when compared to the increase in was due primarily to greater volumes and much higher prices for non firm power purchases from other utilities and marketers due to skyrocketing prices in the volatile west coast power market 
the increase in was due primarily to an increase in secondary power purchases from other utilities and marketers  the increased load due to temperatures that averaged near normal as compared to warmer than normal in  and the increase in electric customers in compared to the colstrip unit generating plant  located in eastern montana  went out of service on september   because of cracks discovered in the generator shaft 
the unit  which pse owns in part and buys power from in part  provides mw of capacity and energy 
it went back into service the weekend of october  loss of power from this unit increased pse s cost of power and reduced energy margins 
the increases were partially offset by a reduction in purchased electricity expenses related to the purchase of the megawatt encogen electric cogeneration plant in november this reduction in purchased electricity expenses was offset in part by increases in fuel  operations and maintenance  and depreciation and interest expenses related to encogen 
prior to the purchase  pse was obligated to purchase the net output of the plant under a power purchase contract 
residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in when compared to  due to the terms set out in the residential exchange termination agreement discussed in operating revenues electric 
residential exchange credits decreased million in when compared to  also as a result of the termination agreement 
residential exchange credits received in were million and are estimated to be million in 
see discussion of the residential purchase and sale agreement under operating revenues electric 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the impact of increased gas costs  which are passed through to customers through the pga mechanism  and a increase in sales volumes 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to due to both the increased volumes of purchases as a result of higher heating load and the increase in gas service customers 
purchased gas expenses also increased by million in compared to due to approval of pse s pga filing effective november  the pga allows pse to recover expected increases in gas costs 
pse defers  as a receivable  any gas costs that exceed the amount in pga rates and accrues interest under the pga 
the balance of the pga receivable was million and million for december  and  respectively 
electric generation fuel expense increased million in compared to as a result of million in encogen fuel expenses  compared to million in  and as a result of pse generating more electricity with higher priced gas and oil at pse owned combustion turbines 
electric generation fuel expense increased million in compared to as a result of a million encogen fuel expense in the fourth quarter of which was partially offset by pse generating less electricity at other pse owned combustion turbines 
pse s acquisition of the megawatt encogen natural gas fired cogeneration facility was completed on november  utility operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to due primarily to high costs related to year remediation expenses in  and electric service restoration following a number of storms which occurred in early the lower operations and maintenance expenses in were partially offset by increased colstrip costs in due to unplanned outages  increased costs of running the encogen plant for all of as compared to two months of  and increased combustion turbine plant costs due to significantly higher usage in utility operations and maintenance increased million in compared to due to the aforementioned increased storm repair costs and increased expenditures for year remediation efforts in infrastrux s operation and maintenance expenses for were million due to the third quarter acquisitions in of its two subsidiaries  utilx and lineal 
pse s other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses at connext and from the sale of homeguard security services  inc in this decrease was offset by pse s write off of the planning and design costs associated with two abandoned utility projects in for a total of million 
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of connext exiting certain product lines in the second quarter of depreciation and amortization expenses increased million in compared to due to the effects of new plant placed into service during the past year  including the encogen plant  purchased in november  and the purchase of consumerlinx  a customer information and billing system  which was placed into service in depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of new plant placed into service during taxes other than federal income taxes increased million in compared to and million in compared to due primarily to increases in municipal taxes and state excise taxes which are revenue based 
federal income taxes increased by million in compared to  and million in compared to primarily due to higher pre tax operating income for the periods 
other income other income  net of federal income tax  decreased million in compared to due primarily to an after tax gain in of million on the sale of cabot oil gas corporation cabot common stock in the second quarter of  and an after tax gain of million related to the sale and assignment of certain non core assets and supply transportation contracts in the decrease is also related to the establishing in of an after tax reserve of million for a write down to the fair values of certain assets held for sale by hydro energy development corp 
to their net realizable values 
the decrease in was partially offset by the after tax gain of approximately million related to the sale of the centralia generating plant 
other income  net of federal income tax  increased million in compared to due primarily to net gains of approximately million from non utility operations in and an increase of million in afudc income 
the million of net gains included gains from the sale of homeguard security services  inc  and pse s common stock investment in cabot 
these gains were offset in part by losses related to sales of non core assets and gas transportation contracts  establishing reserves for two proposed small hydro electric projects and expenses of a subsidiary exiting certain product lines 
interest charges interest charges  which consist of interest and amortization on long term debt and other interest  increased million in compared to as a result of the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series b  in february  the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series b  in september  and the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series c  in november these increases were partially offset by the repayment of million in secured medium term notes since september and million of encogen debt in february other interest expense increased million compared to as a result of higher weighted average interest rates and higher average daily short term borrowings 
interest charges increased million in compared to as a result of the issuance of million senior medium term notes  series a  in june  and million senior medium term notes  series b  in march these increases were partially offset by the maturity or redemption of million in secured medium term notes since february other interest expense decreased million compared to as a result of lower weighted average interest rates 
capital resources and liquidity current construction expenditures for generation  transmission and distribution are designed to meet continuing customer growth and to improve efficiencies of pse s energy delivery systems 
construction expenditures in and also include costs of developing a new customer information system 
construction expenditures  excluding equity afudc  were million in pse expects construction expenditures for the period through will be approximately million  million and million  respectively 
construction expenditure estimates are subject to periodic review and adjustment 
pse expects cash from operations net of dividends and afudc during the period through will  on average  be approximately of average estimated construction expenditures excluding afudc during the same period 
in september  pse filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the offering  on a delayed or continuous basis  of up to million principal amount of senior notes secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds 
on march   pse issued million principal amount of senior medium term notes  series b  which consisted of million principal amount due march  at an interest rate of and million principal amount due march  at an interest rate of 
on february   pse issued million principal amount of senior medium term notes  series b 
the notes are due february  and the proceeds were used to redeem the encogen project debt and pay down a portion of pse s short term debt 
on september   pse issued million principal amount of senior medium term notes  series b  due september   which completed the shelf registration 
in october  pse filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the offering  on a delayed or continuous basis  of up to million principal amount of senior notes secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds  subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities 
on november   pse issued million principal amount of senior medium term notes  series c  due february in and pse issued common stock for pse s stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan of million  shares and million  shares  respectively 
pse s ability to finance its future construction program is dependent upon market conditions and maintaining a level of earnings sufficient to permit the sale of additional securities 
in determining the type and amount of future financing  pse may be limited by restrictions contained in its electric and gas mortgage indentures  articles of incorporation and certain loan agreements 
under the most restrictive tests  at december   pse could issue either i approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds  ii approximately million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of  or iii a combination thereof 
short term borrowings from banks and the sale of commercial paper are used to provide working capital for the construction program 
at december   pse had available million in lines of credit with various banks  which provide credit support for outstanding commercial paper of million  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under these lines of credit to million 

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the most restrictive covenants in pse s articles of incorporation and electric and gas mortgage indentures  earnings reinvested in the business unrestricted as to payment of cash dividends were approximately million at december  pse currently has receivables net of reserves in the amount of million from the caiso and other counterparties  for power sales made in a reserve was established against the receivables as collection of the full amount is currently in question due to problems in the california energy market 
rate matters electric the order approving the merger  issued by the washington commission on february   contained a rate plan designed to provide a five year period of rate certainty for customers and to provide pse with an opportunity to achieve a reasonable return on investment 
general electric tariff rates were stipulated to increase annually between and depending on rate class on january of through electric tariff rates for certain customers will increase by in pse has had no electric rate adjustment mechanism during the rate stability period to adjust for changes in electric energy supply costs or fuel costs 
these variances may now significantly influence earnings 
the rate stabilization period will end on december   at which time pse will be allowed to file for changes in rates  if necessary 
on december   certain industrial customers who receive electric service under a market index based tariff filed a complaint with the washington commission seeking emergency relief from this tariff 
these and other industrial customers had demanded the market index based tariff in return for supporting pse s merger with washington natural gas company 
on december   pse filed a petition requesting that pse be allowed to defer and recover any lost revenue resulting from any relief granted to these customers

the settlement proposal  which currently is being finalized in writing  would result in a significant portion of the industrial loads in question in excess of average megawatts being expected to purchase electricity from other suppliers and in return give up any rights to pse s embedded cost resources 
customers representing a small portion of the load approximately average megawatts have the opportunity to transfer to a tariff with a new small customer rate schedule 
it is expected that the settlement proposal will be submitted to the washington commission in march on march   the washington commission authorized pse to sell its ownership interest in the coal fired centralia electric generating plant located in southwest washington state 
on may   the plant was sold to tecwa power  inc of the resulting pre tax gain  million was allocated to customers and million to pse in accordance with the order 
pse recognized its share of the gain in september pse returned the customers share of the gain  with accrued interest  beginning november  based on customers power usage in november any final true up of the gain will be collected or refunded through pse s conservation rider 
on october   per ferc order  pse filed its plans for forming and participating in a regional transmission organization rto 
ferc s goal is to promote efficiency in wholesale electricity markets and to ensure that electricity consumers pay the lowest price possible for reliable service 
the impact upon pse s operations related to the establishment of an rto cannot be determined with certainty at this time but is not expected to be material 
on october   the washington commission approved pse s request to sell excess sulfur dioxide emission allowances if and to the extent excess allowances are available to be sold 
the proceeds of such sales will be deferred and amortized over a ten year period 
pse estimates the value of the excess sulfur dioxide emission allowances to be million at december rate matters gas the order approving the merger  issued by the washington commission on february   contains a rate plan which provided unchanged rates for all classes of natural gas customers until january   when rates decreased by approximately million annually 
as a result of sharp increases in gas costs during  pse filed two pga and deferral amortization filings with the washington commission which were approved 
the pga filings allow pse to recover expected increases in annual gas costs and deferral amortization filings allow pse to recover prior period gas cost undercollections 
as a result  gas rates to all sales customers increased by an average of on august   and again on january  
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the pga mechanism 
other in the second quarter of  pse sold all of its redeemable convertible preferred stock of cabot oil gas corporation for million 
there was no significant gain or loss on the transaction 
on july   pse and ppl global  llc formerly pp l global  inc terminated an asset purchase agreement dated as of november   under which ppl global  llc had proposed purchasing pse s megawatt interest in the four unit colstrip power plants and associated transmission capacity across montana 
as a result  pse will retain its interest in colstrip units and and interest in colstrip units and on january   puget energy adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
 as amended by statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

statement no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
puget energy enters into both physical and financial contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio 
certain of these contracts outstanding on december  meet the derivative classification requirements of the statement and will be reported at fair value in the balance sheet 
beginning with the implementation of statement no 
 changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as qualifying cash flow hedge under the statement 
puget energy will recognize the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle by recording an after tax decrease to current earnings of approximately million for electric derivative transactions 
in addition  puget energy will record a deferred asset for electric energy contracts designated as qualifying cash flow hedges of approximately million at the adoption with a corresponding increase of approximately million in other comprehensive income 
puget energy anticipates approximately million of the million will reverse during and will  as a result  report a corresponding decrease to the deferred asset and to other comprehensive income to report this reversal 
the decrease in the deferred asset and in other comprehensive income will have no net effect on current earnings 
these estimates are based upon the forward market prices for energy at december  retail gas related derivative transactions are deferred under puget energy s purchased gas adjustment mechanism and recorded in earnings as the transactions are executed under the pga incentive mechanism 
pse entered into an agreement with cellnet data services inc cellnet under which pse would lend cellnet up to million so it can finance the automated meter reading amr network system in pse s service territory 
the network system is collateral for the loan which has a term of five years from the first draw on june  the loan agreement provides for interest only payments during the five year term  with the principal due at the end of the five year term 
as of december  and  the outstanding loan amounts were million and million  respectively 
in the second quarter of  schlumberger completed the acquisition of cellnet which was approved by the bankruptcy court 
in december  pse paid million to buy out tenaska s existing long term gas supply contracts  which contained fixed and escalating gas prices that were well above current and projected future market prices for natural gas 
pse became the principal natural gas supplier to the project and power purchase prices under the tenaska contract were revised to reflect market based prices for the natural gas supply 
pse obtained an order from the washington commission creating a regulatory asset related to the million restructuring payment 
under terms of the order  pse is allowed to accrue as an additional regulatory asset one half the carrying costs of the deferred balance over the first five years 
on november   pse purchased the mw cogeneration plant from encogen northwest  lp pursuant to an october  order from the washington commission approving the purchase  pse will depreciate the original owner s net book value of the plant over the remaining year useful life of the project 
the difference between the purchase price and the net book value of the plant will be amortized over nine years 
in december  pse bought out the remaining years of one of the natural gas supply contracts serving the cogeneration plant from cabot oil gas corporation which provided approximately of the plant s natural gas requirements 
pse became the replacement gas supplier to the project for of the supply under terms of the cabot agreement 
the washington commission has issued an order creating a regulatory asset relating to the million payment that requires pse to accrue carrying costs on the unamortized balance over the first three years 
the acquisitions by infrastrux of utilx and lineal have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the operating results of utilx and lineal have been included in pse s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
these acquisitions mark puget energy s entry into the business of providing design  construction and engineering services to the utility industry 
the total purchase price of the two acquisitions was approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk pse is exposed to market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk pse s energy related businesses are exposed to risks related to changes in commodity prices 
as part of its business  pse markets power to wholesale customers by entering into contracts to purchase or supply electric energy or natural gas at specified delivery points and at specified future delivery dates 
pse s energy risk management function manages pse s core electric and gas supply portfolios 
pse manages its energy supply portfolio to achieve three primary objectives i ensure that physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer requirements  ii manage portfolio risks to limit undesired impacts on pse financial results  and iii optimize the value of pse s energy supply assets 
the portfolio is subject to major sources of variability eg  hydro generation  temperature sensitive retail sales  and market prices for gas and power supplies 
at certain times  these sources of variability can mitigate portfolio imbalances  at other times they can exacerbate portfolio imbalances 
hedging strategies for pse s energy supply portfolio interact with portfolio optimization activities 
some hedges can be implemented in ways that retain pse s ability to use its energy supply portfolio to produce additional value  other hedges can only be achieved by forgoing optimization opportunities 
the prices of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  generation outages and other factors which impact supply and demand 
this commodity price risk is a consequence of purchasing energy at fixed and variable prices and providing deliveries at different tariff and variable prices 
costs associated with ownership and operation of production facilities are another component of this risk 
pse may use forward delivery agreements  swaps and option contracts for the purpose of hedging commodity price risk 
during fiscal year  unrealized changes in the market value of these derivatives are deferred and recognized upon settlement along with the underlying hedged transaction 
effective january   pursuant to statement no 
 which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value  changes in the fair value of pse s derivatives will be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated as qualifying hedge under the statement and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
pse does not consider its current operations to meet the definition of trading activities as described by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
in addition  pse believes its current rate design  including its optional large power sales rate  various special contracts and the pga mechanism mitigate a portion of this risk 
market risk is managed subject to parameters established by the board of directors 
a risk management committee separate from the units that manage these risks monitors compliance with pse s policies and procedures 
in addition  the audit committee of pse s board of directors has oversight of the risk management committee 
interest rate risk pse believes interest rate risk of pse primarily relates to the use of short term debt instruments and new long term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements 
pse manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt of various maturities 
pse does utilize bank borrowings  commercial paper and line of credit facilities to meet short term cash requirements 
these short term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable 
pse may enter into swap instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts  and three interest rate swaps were outstanding as of december  these swaps terminated in and pse did not enter into any other swap instruments as of december  the carrying amounts and fair values of pse s fixed rate debt instruments are carrying fair carrying fair dollars in millions amount value amount value financial liabilities short term debt long term debt    project debt unrecognized financial instruments interest rate swaps
