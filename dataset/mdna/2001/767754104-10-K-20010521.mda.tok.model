item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management believes that the following matters should be considered in connection with the discussion of results of operations and financial condition recent actions affecting operating results 
during fiscal  we took a number of actions which had the short term effect of significantly reducing our operating results but which management believes were nevertheless necessary 
among the actions taken were i the sale of pcs which resulted in our recognizing a loss of million and an increase in income tax expense of million  ii the exchange of approximately million of our debt for shares of our common stock which resulted in a net loss of million  iii our decision to close or relocate certain stores that resulted in an approximate million charge included in the million recorded charges for store closures and impairment  and iv the restatement and audit of our fiscal and financial statements and the related investigation conducted by our audit committee of prior accounting irregularities resulted in our incurring and recording of million of accounting and legal expense 
we anticipate taking similar actions in the future that may have a material negative impact upon our operating results for the period in which we take those actions or subsequent periods 
we also expect to incur significant costs and fees in connection with the refinancing described under recent event 
maturing store base 
since the beginning of fiscal  we built new stores  relocated stores  remodeled and closed  stores 
these new  relocated and remodeled stores represented approximately of our total stores at march  and are generally larger  free standing stores and have higher operating expenses than our older stores 
new stores generally do not become profitable until a critical mass of customers is developed 
relocated stores also must attract additional customers to achieve comparable profitability to the store that was replaced 
we believe that the period of time required for a new store to achieve profitable operations is generally between two and four years 
this period can vary significantly based on the location of a particular store and on other factors  including the investments made in purchasing prescription files for the location and advertising 
our recent liquidity constraints have limited our ability to purchase prescription files and make other investments to promote the development of our new and relocated stores 
we believe that our relatively high percentage of new and relocated stores is a significant factor in our recent operating results 
management believes that as these newer stores mature they should gain the critical mass of customers needed for profitable operations 
we believe this continuing maturation should positively affect our operating performance in future periods 
if we are not able to improve the performance of these new and relocated stores  it will have a material adverse effect on our ability to restore the profitability of our operations 
substantial investigation expenses 
we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the process of reviewing and reconciling our books and records  restating our and financial statements  investigating our prior accounting practices and preparing our financial statements 
included in these expenses are the costs of the deloitte touche llp audits  the investigation by the law firm of swidler  berlin  shereff  friedman  assisted by deloitte touche llp  conducted for our audit committee concerning the accounting irregularities which led to the restatement of our financial statements for our and fiscal years and the costs of retaining arthur andersen llp to assist management in reviewing and reconciling our books and records 
we incurred million in fiscal and we expect to incur million to million in fiscal we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant legal and other expenses in connection with the ongoing litigation and investigations to which we are subject 
dilutive equity issuances 
in june  we completed a series of debt restructuring transactions as described further below under liquidity and capital resources 
in connection with these transactions  an aggregate total of  shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for million principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  in november  january and april  we completed numerous privately negotiated transactions  and in connection with these transactions  an aggregate total of  shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for approximately million principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness 
in march  we also exchanged approximately million principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock upon completion of a public tender offer 
as a result of these exchanges  we recorded an aggregate loss on conversion of approximately million in fiscal and will record additional losses in fiscal in addition  pursuant to the conversion price adjustment and pay in kind dividend provisions of the series b convertible preferred stock issued to green equity investors iii  lp in october   shares of our common stock were issuable upon the conversion of such preferred stock at march  assuming the transactions which occurred subsequent to march  and prior to may  had occurred on march   the common shares outstanding would have increased from  to  in light of our substantial leverage and liquidity constraints  we will continue to consider opportunities to use our equity securities to discharge debt or other obligations that may arise 
such issuances will have a dilutive effect on the outstanding shares of our common stock 
accounting systems 
following its review of our books and records  management concluded that further steps were needed to establish and maintain the adequacy of our internal accounting systems and controls 
in connection with the audit of our financial statements  deloitte touche llp advised us that it believed there were numerous reportable conditions under the standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants which relate to our accounting systems and controls and could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements 
we are developing and implementing comprehensive  adequate and reliable accounting systems and controls which address the reportable conditions identified by deloitte touche llp 
sale of pcs 
on october   we sold pcs  our pbm segment  to advance paradigm now advancepcs 
the selling price of pcs consisted of million in cash  million in principal amount of advancepcs s promissory notes and advancepcs equity securities 
accordingly  the pbm segment is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements  and the operating income of the pbm segment through october   the date of sale  is reflected separately from the income from continuing operations 
the loss on disposal of the pbm segment was million 
additionally  we recorded an increase to the tax valuation allowance and income tax expense of million in the first quarter of fiscal in continuing operations 
working capital 
we generally finance our inventory and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and borrowings 
we expect to use borrowings to finance inventories and to support our continued growth 
over of our front end sales are in cash 
third party insurance programs  which typically settle in fewer than days  accounted for of our pharmacy sales and of our revenues in fiscal seasonality 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations in the fourth quarter as the result of the seasonal nature of christmas and the flu season 
we tailor certain front end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons 
results of operations year ended march  february  february  dollars in thousands sales    sales growth same store sales growth pharmacy sales growth same store pharmacy sales growth pharmacy as a of total sales third party sales as a of total pharmacy sales front end sales growth same store front end sales growth front end as a of total sales store data total stores beginning of period    new stores closed stores store acquisitions  net total stores end of period    remodeled stores relocated stores sales the growth in revenues in fiscal is driven by an increase of in front end sales  an increase of in pharmacy sales and the additional week in fiscal our total revenues growth in fiscal of was fueled by strong growth in pharmacy sales  offset by a slight decline in front end sales 
same store sales growth for fiscal was 
as fiscal was a week year  same store sales are calculated by comparing the week period ending march  with the week period ending march  for fiscal and  pharmacy revenues led sales growth with same store sales increases of and  respectively 
fiscal increases were generated by our ability to attract and retain managed care customers  our successful pilot markets for reduced cash pricing  our increased focus on pharmacy initiatives such as will call and predictive refill  and favorable industry trends 
these favorable trends include an aging population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems  and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs 
fiscal pharmacy increases were driven by favorable industry trends  as well as the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacies 
the lower growth in same store pharmacy sales in fiscal was due primarily to a significant reduction in the number of prescription files we purchased and store relocations we effected 
the lower growth in fiscal was due primarily to a reduction as compared to fiscal in the number of relocations effected 
same store front end sales  which includes all non prescription sales  such as seasonal merchandise  convenience items  and food and other non prescription sales  increased from fiscal this increase was fueled by the reinstatement of our weekly circular advertising program  and was also driven by strong performance in seasonal businesses  consumables  vitamins  general merchandise and private brands 
same store front end sales in fiscal decreased from fiscal levels 
this decrease was due to elevated levels of out of stock merchandise in the rd and th quarters of fiscal  and the decision of former management to suspend the weekly advertising program in fiscal and to raise front end prices to levels that were not competitive 
year ended march  february  february  dollars in thousands costs of goods sold    gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses    selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues goodwill amortization    store closing and impairment charges    interest expense    loss on debt conversions and modifications  share of loss from equity investments   gain on sale of fixed assets   cost of goods sold gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the slight decline in margin is attributable to a shifting in sales mix to pharmacy from front end 
in fiscal  the percentage of front end sales to total sales decreased to from in also contributing to the lower margin in was an increase in sales of cigarettes and liquor as a percentage of front end sales 
additionally  we incurred million in inventory liquidation losses related to our closed stores 
partially offsetting the items above was an improvement in the margin of front end goods exclusive of cigarettes and liquor 
these increases resulted from a more profitable product mix  and from increases in the levels of one hour photo and phone card sales 
gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was a result of a substantial decline in our pharmacy margins 
a decline in occupancy costs in fiscal was largely offset by increased costs related to our distribution facilities 
we incurred significant costs in fiscal in connection with the distribution facility located in perryman  maryland and also in connection with the processing of merchandise received from our stores for shipment back to our vendors 
these increased costs were partially offset by a substantial credit to cost of goods sold resulting from the receipt of vendor allowances following a restructuring of the terms of certain vendor contracts 
in fiscal  prior to the restructuring of the contracts  these vendor allowances were credited to selling  general and administrative expense 
also partially offsetting the increases in cost of goods sold in fiscal were improved store level margins for front end and pharmacy sales 
also negatively impacting gross margins in the periods presented was the continuing industry trend of rising third party sales coupled with decreasing margins on third party reimbursed prescription sales 
third party prescription sales typically have lower gross margins than other prescription sales because they are paid by a person or entity other than the recipient of the prescribed pharmaceutical and are generally subject to lower negotiated reimbursement rates in conjunction with a pharmacy benefit plan 
pharmacy sales as a percentage of total sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively and third party sales as a percentage of pharmacy sales were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we have changed our method of accounting for lifo as of february  see accounting change 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense sg a was of sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal sg a expenses for were favorably impacted by a million increase in estimated insurance recovery related to the settlement of the shareholder s class action lawsuit  and by million received related to the partial settlement of litigation with certain drug manufacturers 
offsetting these items was million incurred in connection with the restatement of our historical financial statements  and the incurrence of million in non cash expense related to variable plan accounting on certain management stock options  and restricted stock grants 
if these non operating and non cash items are excluded  our sg a as a percentage of revenues would have been 
sg a expense for was unfavorably impacted by a charge of million related to litigation issues  offset by a reversal of stock appreciation rights accruals of million 
excluding these non operating and non cash items results in an adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales of in fiscal sg a on an adjusted basis of for fiscal compares favorably with sg a on an adjusted basis of for fiscal due to lower depreciation expense resulting from a net reduction in our store count  decreased repair and maintenance and terminated project costs  and the better leveraging of fixed sg a costs resulting from our higher sales volume 
the increase in sg a expense as a percent of sales in fiscal over fiscal is predominately attributable to increased accruals for litigation and other contingencies  as described above 
store closing and impairment charges store closing and impairment charges consist of year ended march  february  february  dollars in thousands impairment charges    store lease exit costs    impairment of investments  impairment charges in fiscal  and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the impairment of long lived assets including allocable goodwill of  and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were assessed for impairment as part of our on going review of the performance of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close the store 
store lease exit cost costs incurred to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  are recorded at the time management commits to closing the store  which is the date that the closure is formally approved by senior management  or in the case of a store to be relocated  the date the new property is leased or purchased 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
as a result of focused efforts on cost recoveries for closed stores during fiscal  we experienced improved results  which has been reflected in the assumptions about future sublease income 
this liability is discounted using a risk free rate of interest 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
impairment of investments we have an investment in the common stock of drugstore 
com  which is accounted for under the equity method 
the initial investment was valued based upon the initial public offering price for drugstore 
com 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment of our investment in drugstore 
com of million 
this write down was based upon a decline in the market value of drugstore 
com s stock that we believe to be other than temporary 
additionally  we recorded impairment charges of million for other investments 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the substantial increase in fiscal and fiscal is due to higher average levels of indebtedness and higher interest rates on debt 
in fiscal  we increased our average outstanding debt with the addition of the billion senior secured credit facility  which includes a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
we used the term loan to terminate our accounts receivable securitization facility and repurchased million of unpaid receivables thereunder and funded million of transaction costs related to our debt restructuring 
the remainder of the term loan together with the revolving credit facility were used for general corporate purposes  including reviewing  reconciling and restating our and financial statements  the cost of the audit of our restated financial statements and investigation costs 
these items were partially offset by reductions of indebtedness in the second half of the fiscal year resulting from the sale of pcs and debt for equity exchanges 
in fiscal  our debt increased as a result of the billion borrowed in january under the pcs credit facility and the million of demand note borrowings to supplement cash flows from operating activities 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were  and respectively 
income taxes we had net losses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal tax expense of and tax benefits of million including the benefit related to cumulative effect of accounting change and million have been reflected for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the full benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards nols generated in each period has been fully offset by a valuation allowance based on management s determination that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we expect to file amended tax returns and utilize the nol s against taxable income in prior years to the maximum extent possible 
it is likely that an ownership change for statutory purposes may occur as a result of our refinancing efforts  including issuances of equity and exchanges of debt for equity 
if an ownership change occurs  the use of our existing nols and possibly our net unrealized built in losses would be subject to limitations 
of the million recoverable taxes recorded as of february   we have collected or have offsets of million 
the remaining million has been reclassified to other non current assets since we anticipate collection beyond fiscal other significant charges in addition to the operational matters discussed above  our results in the current fiscal year have been adversely affected by other significant charges 
we recorded a net loss of million on the disposal of the pbm segment 
as a result of the decision to dispose of the pbm segment  we recognized an increase in the income tax valuation allowance of million for fiscal we also recorded a pre tax loss of million on debt conversions and modifications  and recorded a loss of million representing our share of the drugstore 
com losses 
discontinued operations on july   we announced the sale of the pbm segment  at which time the pbm segment was subjected to discontinued operations accounting 
prior to becoming a discontinued operation on july   the pbm segment generated net income of million from february  through july   compared to net income of million in fiscal and a net loss of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have two primary sources of liquidity i cash provided by operations and ii the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility 
we may also generate liquidity from the sale of assets  including sale leaseback transactions 
during fiscal and fiscal  cash provided by operations was not sufficient to fund our working capital requirements 
as a result  we have supplemented our cash from operations with borrowings under our credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  service our obligations to pay interest and principal on our debt  and to provide funds for capital expenditures 
on may   we entered into a commitment letter to refinance a significant portion of our indebtedness 
see recent event 
credit facilities and june debt restructuring in june  we completed a major financial restructuring that provided us with additional liquidity  extended the maturity dates of a substantial amount of our debt until at least august and converted a portion of our debt to equity 
senior secured credit facility 
in june  we entered into a billion which was increased to billion in november senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by citibank na  as agent 
the facility matures on august   and consists of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
we used the term facility to terminate our accounts receivable securitization facility and repurchase million of unpaid receivables thereunder  to fund million of transaction costs relating to our financial restructuring and to provide million of cash available for general corporate purposes 
the revolving facility provides us with borrowings for working capital requirements  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facilities generally bear interest either at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
for additional information about the interest rates applicable to our credit facilities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks below 
we are required to pay fees of per annum on the daily unused amount of the commitment 
substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the senior secured credit facility 
these subsidiary guarantees are secured by a first priority lien on the inventory  accounts receivable  intellectual property and some of the real estate assets of the subsidiary guarantors 
our direct obligations under the senior credit facility are unsecured 
the senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants  which place restrictions on the assumption of debt  the payment of dividends  mergers  liens and sale leaseback transactions 
the facility requires us to meet various financial ratios and limits our capital expenditures 
in connection with the additional term loan borrowings in november  we also amended certain of the financial covenants in this facility to conform to the less restrictive covenants in our other debt agreements for a limited period of time 
for the three quarters ended march   our covenants required us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  increasing to a minimum interest coverage ratio of and a minimum fixed charge ratio of for the four quarters ending june  for the three fiscal quarters ended march   our consolidated ebitda as defined in the senior secured credit facility was required to be no less than million  increasing to million for the four quarters ending june  in addition  our capital expenditures were limited to million for the three fiscal quarters ended march   increasing to million for the four quarters ending june  for the three quarters ended march   our ebitda as so defined was million  our interest coverage ratio was  our fixed charge coverage ratio was and our capital expenditures were million 
the facility provides for customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of our debt to accelerate the maturity of debt equaling million or more 
our ability to borrow under the senior secured credit facility is based on a specified borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
at march   the million term loan was fully drawn and we had million in additional available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility 
other credit facilities 
in june  we extended to august the maturity date of our rcf credit facility and our pcs credit facility 
borrowings under the pcs credit facility bear interest at libor plus and borrowings under the rcf credit facility bear interest at libor plus 
these credit facilities contain restrictive covenants which place restrictions on the assumption of debt  the payment of dividends  mergers  liens and sale leaseback transactions 
they also require us to satisfy financial covenants which are generally slightly less restrictive than the covenants in our senior secured credit facility 
the facilities also limit the amount of our capital expenditures to million for the three quarters ended march   increasing to million for the four quarters ending june  we applied billion all of the net proceeds from the sale of pcs minus certain expenses to reduce the outstanding balances of the pcs credit facility and the pcs exchange debt described below 
under the terms of these facilities  after giving effect to the million increase in the term loan  we are permitted to incur up to an additional million of indebtedness under the senior secured credit facility without the further consent of the lenders 
at april   we had billion of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities and exchange debt 
these facilities are also guaranteed and secured as described below 
the rcf credit facility is secured by a first lien on the stock of drugstore 
com 
as part of the restructuring of our debt in june  certain affiliates of jp morgan  which had lent us million under a demand note in june and was also a lender under the rcf and pcs credit facilities  together with certain other lenders under the two credit facilities  agreed to exchange a portion of their loans for a new secured exchange debt obligation and shares of our common stock 
this resulted in a total of million of debt under these facilities  including million of the outstanding principal of the demand note  being exchanged for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exchange rate of per share 
we recorded a gain on this exchange of debt of million in the second quarter of fiscal an additional million of borrowings under the facilities were exchanged for the exchange debt  including the entire remaining principal amount of the demand note 
the terms of the exchange debt are substantially the same as the terms of our rcf and pcs credit facilities and the interest rate is currently libor plus 
the lenders of the exchange debt have the same collateral as they did with respect to their loans under the pcs and rcf credit facilities 
also  as part of the restructuring of our debt in june  we amended our existing guarantees of two synthetic lease transactions to provide substantially the same terms as the terms of our rcf and pcs credit facilities 
in connection with modifications to the pcs and rcf credit facilities  the exchange of debt for exchange debt and the amendment of guarantees of the synthetic lease transactions  substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries guaranteed our obligations thereunder on a second priority basis 
these subsidiary guarantees are secured by a second priority lien on the inventory  accounts receivable  intellectual property and some of the real estate assets of the subsidiary guarantors 
the holders of exchange debt also received a first lien on our prescription files 
except to the extent previously secured  our direct obligations under those facilities and guarantees remain unsecured 
debt covenants 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior secured credit facility and our other credit facilities and debt instruments as of march  with continuing improvements in operating performance  we anticipate that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
however  variations in our operating performance and unanticipated developments may adversely affect our ability to remain in compliance with the applicable debt covenants 
commercial paper 
until september   we issued commercial paper supported by unused credit commitments to supplement cash generated by operations 
since the loss of our investment grade rating in fiscal  we are no longer able to issue commercial paper 
our outstanding commercial paper amounted to million at february  and  million at february  all remaining commercial paper obligations were repaid in march exchange offers 
in june  we completed the exchange of million of our notes due december and million of our notes due december for an aggregate of million of our senior secured notes due september after the exchange  million of the notes due december and million of the notes due december remained outstanding 
in connection with the exchange  we entered into a forward purchase agreement with jp morgan and another financial institution under which they agreed to purchase million of the senior secured notes due these financial institutions purchased million of the notes and million of the notes on july   million of the notes on september   and

net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities we used million of cash to fund continuing operations in fiscal operating cash flow was negatively impacted by million of interest payments 
operating cash flow was also negatively impacted from an increase in current assets  primarily resulting from repurchasing million of accounts receivable when we refinanced the accounts receivable securitization facility  and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
in fiscal  we used million of cash to fund continuing operations 
operating cash flow was negatively impacted by million of interest payments 
operating cash flow was also negatively impacted from an increase in current assets and a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by an increase in other liabilities 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal cash was provided from the sale of our discontinued operations  various other assets  less expenditures for fixed and intangible assets 
cash used for investing activities was million and billion for fiscal years and  respectively 
cash used for store construction and relocations amounted to million for fiscal and billion for fiscal in addition  cash of billion was used to acquire pcs in fiscal cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the cash used consisted of payments of million of deferred financing costs partially offset by net debt borrowings of million and proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of million 
during fiscal  we used the proceeds from the sale of our pbm segment to reduce our borrowings 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and  million for fiscal increased borrowings under our rcf and pcs credit facilities which replaced our commercial paper program and the sale of million of preferred stock were the main financing activities during fiscal in fiscal  we issued commercial paper to finance the acquisition of pcs 
also during fiscal  net proceeds were received from the issuance of million in long term debt and million of dealer remarketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities included proceeds received from store sale leaseback transactions of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately million related to new store construction  store relocation and other store construction projects 
an additional million will be dedicated to other store improvement activities and the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacists 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility available under our senior secured facility 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
based upon our current levels of operations and expected improvements in our operating performance  management believes that cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and our other sources of liquidity including asset sales will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures until august and september  when billion of our indebtedness as of april   including the revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facility  matures 
for a discussion of factors that could affect our current assessment  see factors affecting our future prospects below 
our ability to replace  refinance or otherwise extend these obligations will depend in part on our ability to successfully execute our long term strategy and improve the operating performance of our stores 
on may   we entered into a commitment letter to refinance a significant portion of our indebtedness  see recent event 
accounting change in fiscal  we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting by restructuring our lifo pool structure through a combination of certain geographic pools 
the reduction in the number of lifo pools was made to more closely align the lifo pool structure to store merchandise categories 
the effect of this change in fiscal was to decrease our earnings by million net of income tax benefit of million or 
per diluted common share 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was a charge of million net of income tax benefit of million or 
per diluted common share 
the pro forma effect of this accounting change would have been a reduction in net income of million  net of income tax benefit of million or 
per diluted common share for fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended by sfas  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  will be required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated and effective as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the changes in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the derivative will be recorded in other comprehensive income oci and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
sfas defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings 
on march   in connection with the adoption of the new statement  we will record a reduction of approximately million in oci as a cumulative transition adjustment for derivatives designated as cash flow type hedges prior to adopting sfas certain issues currently under consideration by the derivatives implementation group dig may make it more difficult to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting in the future 
pending the results of the dig deliberations  changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps may be recorded as a component of net income 
factors affecting our future prospects risks related to our financial condition we are highly leveraged 
our substantial indebtedness severely limits cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary 
as of april   we had billion of outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money including current maturities but excluding letters of credit and billion of capital leases and a negative stockholders equity 
as of the same date  we had additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
based on the indebtedness outstanding at april  and the then current interest rates  our annualized cash interest expense would be approximately million 
our high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will o limit our ability to obtain additional financing  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete  o place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness  o render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and o require us to dedicate substantially all of our cash flow to service our debt 
a substantial portion of our indebtedness matures in august and september our ability to refinance this indebtedness will be substantially dependent on our ability to improve our operating performance 
if we do not consummate the refinancing transaction described under recent event  approximately billion of our indebtedness at april  will mature in august and september in order to satisfy these obligations  we will need to refinance them  sell assets to satisfy them or seek postponement of their maturity dates from our existing lenders 
our ability successfully to accomplish any of these transactions will be substantially dependent on the successful execution of our long term strategic plan and the resulting improvements in our operating performance 
the interest rate on certain of our outstanding indebtedness is based upon floating interest rates 
if interest rates increase  our interest payment obligations will increase 
approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness as of april  bears an interest rate that varies depending upon libor 
if we borrow additional amounts under our senior secured facility  the interest rate on those borrowings will vary depending upon libor 
if libor rises  the interest rates on this outstanding debt will also increase 
therefore an increase in libor would increase our interest payment obligations under these outstanding loans and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
we anticipate that any replacement financing we obtain will also have the interest rate on a floating rate 
the covenants in our outstanding indebtedness impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
the covenants in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to incur liens and debt  pay dividends  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make loans  investments and capital expenditures  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers  consolidations  asset dispositions  sale leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions  change our business  amend certain debt and other material agreements  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  make distributions from subsidiaries and grant negative pledges to other creditors 
we anticipate that any replacement financing we obtain  including those proposed by our may  bank commitment letter  will impose similar restrictions 
moreover  if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach of any of these covenants  a default could result under one or more of these agreements 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable 
if acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
risks related to our operations major lawsuits have been brought against us and certain of our subsidiaries  and there are currently pending both civil and criminal investigations by the us securities and exchange commission and the united states attorney 
any criminal conviction against us may result in the loss of licenses that are material to the conduct of our business  which would have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal governmental investigations by the sec and the united states attorney concerning our financial reporting and other matters 
in addition  an investigation has also been commenced by the us department of labor concerning our employee benefit plans  including our principal k plan  which permitted employees to purchase our common stock 
purchases of our common stock under the plan were suspended in october in january  we appointed an independent trustee to represent the interests of these plans in relation to the company and to investigate possible claims the plans may have against us 
both the independent trustee and the department of labor have asserted that the plans may have claims against us 
these investigations are ongoing and we cannot predict their outcomes 
if we were convicted of any crime  certain contracts that are material to our operations may be revoked  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  substantial penalties  damages  or other monetary remedies assessed against us could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our other suppliers to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
we obtain approximately of our pharmaceutical supplies from a single supplier  mckesson hboc  inc  pursuant to a long term contract 
pharmacy sales represented approximately of our total sales during fiscal  and  therefore  our relationship with mckesson hboc is important to us 
any significant disruptions in our relationships with our suppliers  particularly our relationship with mckesson hboc would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business  and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our internal accounting systems and controls may be insufficient 
an audit of our financial statements for fiscal years and  following a previous restatement  concluded in july and resulted in an additional restatement of fiscal years and following its review of our books and records  our management concluded that further steps were needed to establish and maintain the adequacy of our internal accounting systems and controls 
in connection with the above audits of our financial statements  deloitte touche llp advised us that it believed there were numerous reportable conditions under the standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants which relate to our accounting systems and controls and could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements 
in order to address the reportable conditions identified  we are developing and implementing comprehensive  adequate and reliable accounting systems and controls which address the reportable conditions identified by deloitte touche llp 
if  however  we determine that our internal accounting systems and controls require additional improvements beyond those identified  we may need to commit substantial resources  including time from our management team  to implement new systems and controls 
we cannot assure you that management will be able to successfully manage our business or successfully implement our strategic plan 
in december  we hired a new management team 
our management team has considerable experience in the retail industry 
nonetheless  we cannot assure you that our management will be able successfully to manage our business or successfully implement our strategic business plan 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our chairman and chief executive officer  robert g 
miller  and the other members of our management team 
the loss of mr 
miller or other key personnel due to death  disability or termination of employment could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations or financial condition  or both 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future 
we need to continue to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition  but our operations will not improve if we cannot continue to effectively implement our business strategy 
our operations during fiscal were adversely affected by a number of factors  including our financial difficulties  inventory shortages  allegations of violations of the law  including drug pricing issues  problems with suppliers and uncertainties regarding our ability to produce audited financial statements 
to improve operations  new management developed and in fiscal had been implementing and continues to implement  a business strategy to improve the pricing of products  provide more consistent advertising through weekly  national circulars  eliminated inventory shortages and out dated inventory  shortages  resolved issues and disputes with our vendors  developed programs intended to enhance customer relationships and provide better service and continue to improve our stores and the product offerings within our stores 
if we are not successful in implementing our business strategy  or if our business strategy is not effective  we may not be able to continue to improve our operations 
failure to continue to improve operations would adversely affect our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt 
the additional unregistered shares of common stock that we issued may depress the market price of our common stock because we have agreed to register those shares under the securities act to enable the holders of the shares to sell them 
we are obligated to register the shares of our common stock that we issued in various transactions 
in addition  we are obligated to register the  shares of our common stock underlying as of march  the series b convertible preferred stock that we issued in october and the  shares of our common stock underlying the warrant issued to jp morgan ventures corporation on october as of may   we have also agreed to register an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock that we issued or agreed to issue in various debt for equity exchanges 
in addition  we expect to agree to register a significant number of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to the refinancings of our debt described under recent event  and we may agree to register additional shares in the future pursuant to additional refinancings 
the possible public sale of such large numbers of shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
risks related to our industry the markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drug store chains  independent drug stores  supermarkets and mass merchandisers 
we may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours 
in addition  we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
as competition increases  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue effectively to compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales of prescription drugs  as a percentage of sales  have been increasing and we expect them to continue to increase 
in fiscal  we were reimbursed by third party payors for approximately of all of the prescription drugs that we sold 
these third party payors could reduce the levels at which they will reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  if medicare is reformed to include prescription benefits  medicare may cover some of the prescription drugs that we now sell at retail prices  and we may be reimbursed at prices lower than our current retail prices 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices  our margins on these sales would be reduced  and the profitability of our business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could hurt our business  the results of our operations or our financial condition 
our pharmacy business is subject to federal  state  and local regulation 
these include local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations  and prohibitions against paid referrals of patients 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business 
furthermore  our pharmacies could be affected by federal and state reform programs  such as health care reform initiatives which could  in turn  negatively affect our business 
the passing of these initiatives or any new federal or state programs could adversely affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
certain risks are inherent in the provision of pharmacy services  our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  which are our higher margin products 
if the economy slows down and unemployment increases or inflationary conditions worry consumers  our consumers may decrease their purchases  particularly of products other than pharmaceutical products that they need for health reasons 
we make a higher profit on our sales of front end products than we do on sales of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  any decrease in our sales of front end products will decrease our profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
since the end of fiscal  our primary risk exposure has not changed 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of march  fair value at march  thereafter total dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion fixed rate         average interest rate interest rate swap  variable rate    average interest rate in june  we entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the libor component of million of our variable rate debt at for a two year period 
in july  we entered into an additional interest rate swap that fixes the libor component of an additional million of variable rate debt at for a two year period 
our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the ratings on the senior secured credit facility  the rcf credit facility  the pcs credit facility and the fixed rate obligations as of march  were b by standard poor s and by caa by moody s 
the exchange debt facility has not been rated 
the interest rates on the variable rate borrowings are as follows billion senior credit facility libor plus  the rcf facility libor plus  the pcs and the exchange debt facilities libor plus 
further downgrades of our credit ratings will not have an impact upon the rate on the borrowings under these credit facilities 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of and as of march  and april   respectively  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million and million  respectively  based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately billion and million as of march  and april   respectively 
a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures
