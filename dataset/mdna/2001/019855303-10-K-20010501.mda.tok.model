we leverage our media assets and contact points with generation y boys and girls to drive sales of teen focused apparel  accessories and action sports equipment  and sell comprehensive marketing and advertising services packages to companies seeking to reach the generation y audience 
our revenues consist of merchandise revenues and sponsorship and other revenues 
we generate merchandise revenues through both our catalogs and our web sites 
we generate sponsorship and other revenues primarily through the sale of sponsorships  banner advertisements  co marketing programs and other revenue sharing arrangements on our web sites and in our catalogs 
revenues from sales of merchandise are recognized at the time products are shipped to customers 
revenues from sponsorships  advertising and other arrangements are recognized during the period in which the sponsorship or advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant performance obligations remain and the collection of the related receivable is probable 
we were incorporated in january  launched our www 
alloy 
com web site in august and began recognizing meaningful revenues in august following the distribution of our first alloy catalog 
to date  the majority of our revenues have been generated through merchandise sales  however  we expect sponsorship and other revenues to increase in future periods as a result of our plans to increase visitors to our web sites  expand the number and breadth of our contact points with the generation y demographic group and further develop our marketing and sales team to capitalize on our sponsorship  advertising and other revenue opportunities 
in may  we issued  shares of common stock in our initial public offering and received approximately million in net proceeds  after deduction of underwriter s commissions and discounts and expenses related to our initial public offering 
in april  alloy consummated a financial and strategic arrangement with liberty digital  inc  a subsidiary of liberty media group  inc  pursuant to which alloy issued  shares of its common stock to a subsidiary of liberty digital in exchange for million in cash and  shares of liberty digital common stock 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the fiscal year ended january   million for the fiscal year ended january   and million for the fiscal year ended january  at january  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the net losses and accumulated deficit resulted primarily from the costs associated with developing our www 
alloy 
com web site and name database of generation y boys and girls  attracting users to our www 
alloy 
com web site  establishing the alloy brand  and amortizing goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
because of our plans to continue to invest in marketing and promotion  to grow our name database through catalog circulation  to hire additional employees  to develop our web sites and operating infrastructure  and to make strategic acquisitions  we expect to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent periods  this growth may not be sustainable and  therefore  these recent periods should not be considered indicative of future performance 
we may never achieve significant revenues or profitability  or if we achieve significant revenues they may not be sustained in future periods 
for purposes of the discussion below  the fiscal year ended january  is referred to as fiscal  the fiscal year ended january  is referred to as fiscal  and the fiscal year ended january  is referred to as fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues year ended january  statements of operations data net merchandise revenues sponsorship and other revenues total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill total operating expenses loss from operations interest expense income  net realized loss on marketable securities and investments charge for early retirement of debt net loss fiscal years ended january   january  and january  revenues merchandise revenues 
net merchandise revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a increase  to million in fiscal  a increase 
the increase in merchandise revenues in fiscal was due primarily to the increased size of our name database to which we marketed our merchandise offerings  an expansion of marketing programs targeted to names outside of our database  our expanded merchandise offerings  and the inclusion of merchandise sales from our ccs catalog and ccs 
com web site from july when the ccs acquisition closed 
pursuant to the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs  alloy has reclassified in its consolidated statements of operations for the years ended january  and shipping and handling revenues resulting in an increase of net merchandise revenues of  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
sponsorship and other revenues 
sponsorship and other revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of  due primarily to the selling efforts by our in house advertising sales force which operated for the full year in fiscal versus approximately six months in fiscal in addition  increased web site traffic at www 
alloy 
com and increased alloy catalog circulation provided more advertising inventory to sell in fiscal relative to fiscal in fiscal  our in house advertising sales group commenced development of commercial relationships to take advantage of the increased number of visitors to our web site and our new online services 
as a result  sponsorship and other revenues amounted to million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the merchandise sold by alloy plus the freight cost to deliver the merchandise to the warehouse  together with the direct costs attributable to the sponsorship and advertising programs we provide and the publications we develop and produce 
our cost of goods sold increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  a increase  to million in fiscal  a increase 
the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the increase in merchandise sales to alloy s growing customer base 
alloy s gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the relative growth in our sponsorship and other revenues  our expanded merchandise offerings  and our increased purchasing power with our merchandise vendors 
the decrease in our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal was due to the inclusion of lower margin ccs merchandise sales from july when our ccs acquisition closed  offset by an increased overall percentage of higher margin sponsorship and other revenues generated in fiscal operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of alloy and ccs catalog production and mailing costs  our call center and fulfillment operations expenses  freight out to our merchandise customers  salaries of our sales and marketing personnel  marketing costs  and expenses related to the development  maintenance and marketing of our web sites 
these selling and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the increased costs incurred in marketing  selling and shipping to our expanded database  the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  and increased spending on web site development and maintenance 
these selling and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the increased costs of marketing and selling to our growing database  more extensive web site promotion and development  the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  and increased spending on advertising in a variety of media to increase brand awareness  attract additional visitors to the alloy 
com web site and grow online merchandise sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  our selling and marketing expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal after declining from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from our more targeted merchandise marketing to our enlarged name database  improved fulfillment efficiencies resulting from increased shipping activity and reduced general advertising and marketing activity 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to more targeted merchandise marketing to more productive names in our name database and fulfillment efficiencies associated with higher order volumes  offset by an expanded advertising and marketing campaign following our initial public offering in may fulfillment expenses have risen from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but as a percentage of total revenues have fallen from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal pursuant to the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
 alloy has reclassified in its consolidated statements of operations for the years ended january  and shipping and handling revenues and the related shipping and handling costs that were previously netted  with the residual amount included in selling and marketing expenses 
the impact of this reclassification resulted in an increase of selling and marketing expenses of  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to continue to increase significantly in future periods 
we believe that these increases will be principally related to expanded catalog circulation targeted to our growing name database and the costs associated with fulfilling and shipping an anticipated increased number of merchandise orders resulting therefrom 
in addition  we expect to continue hiring additional sales and marketing personnel in an effort to drive increased advertising and sponsorship sales to companies that seek to reach our generation y community 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative  finance and management personnel  as well as support services and professional service fees 
these expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  our general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and decreased to in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal was driven by an increase in compensation expense for additional personnel to handle our growing business  together with expenses incurred as a result of becoming a public company after our initial public offering in may  such as professional fees  insurance premiums and public relations costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to grow as we hire additional personnel and incur additional expenses related to the growth of our business and our operations as a public company 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was approximately million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal and zero in fiscal these costs were recorded in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of celebrity sightings  llc in december  the merger of our acquisition subsidiary with and into th street acquisition corp  the sole stockholder of th street productions  inc in january  our acquisition of all the capital stock of kubic marketing  inc in july  our acquisition of all the capital stock of triple dot communications  inc in december and our acquisition of all of the membership interests of y access llc in january these acquisitions were all accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
we anticipate that the future amortization of goodwill in connection with these acquisitions will continue to be amortized on a straight line basis over three to five years for each of these transactions and will amount to approximately million per quarter until the end of fiscal  declining thereafter until the related goodwill is fully amortized 
as further discussed in recent accounting pronouncements below  the fasb has issued a proposed statement regarding business combinations and intangible assets  which is expected to be issued in june the proposal eliminates amortization of goodwill and requires an annual impairment review of goodwill based on fair value 
accordingly  future periods will be impacted by this statement  when effective  for the elimination of amortization and potential impairments of goodwill to be recognized 
loss from operations as described above  we continue to invest heavily to build the alloy and ccs brands  grow and market to our customer database  enhance and attract visitors to our web sites  increase the number of our employees to support a growing operation  and make strategic acquisitions 
for the foregoing reasons  our loss from operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of  and to million in fiscal  an increase of 
interest expense income  net interest income net of expense includes income from our cash and cash equivalents and from investments and expenses related to our financing obligations 
in fiscal  we incurred net interest expense of  due to the interest expense resulting from our issuance of promissory notes in may  which exceeded our interest earned on cash balances held 
in fiscal and fiscal  we generated net interest income of million and million  respectively  due to the investment of proceeds raised in our initial public offering and through our issuance of common stock to ldig 
realized loss on marketable securities and investments and charge for early retirement of debt in fiscal  we sold  shares of ldig common stock resulting in a loss on sale of approximately million 
we also wrote off a minority investment in a private company in fiscal resulting in a loss on investment of million 
as a result of the early retirement of our outstanding promissory notes upon the closing of the our initial public offering in may  we incurred a one time extraordinary charge of  selected unaudited quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended january  in the opinion of management  the unaudited financial results include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for the fair presentation of our results of operations for those periods

we began building our in house advertising sales force in the second quarter of fiscal since that time  the level of sponsorship and other revenues has significantly increased  and in relation to the seasonality of our business  such activities peak during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues has ranged between approximately and with the higher percentages occurring in quarters that have a relatively higher percentage of sponsorship and other revenues 
given the seasonality of our business  the percentage of our sponsorship and other revenues to our total quarterly revenues tends to peak in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year 
the level of our selling and marketing expenses is generally correlated with our catalog circulation and merchandise selling cycle which peaks in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year and troughs in the first and second quarters 
general and administrative expenses have been rising as a result of increasing personnel  increasing operating costs of our growing business and costs related to our being a public company 
as a percentage of revenues  our selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses tend to decline in our fiscal third and fourth quarters due to seasonally higher order volumes and order values relative to catalogs circulated  and the leverage that we have on our fixed expense base when our revenues seasonally peak 
we expect our quarterly revenues  margins and results of operations to fluctuate significantly in the future 
in addition  the results of any quarter do not indicate results that should be expected for a full fiscal year 
if our revenues  margins or operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future periods  then the price of our common stock could decline 
seasonality our historical revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter due to seasonal fluctuations in consumer purchasing patterns 
sales of apparel  accessories  footwear and action sports equipment through our web sites and catalogs have been higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters which contain the key back to school and holiday selling seasons  than in our first and second fiscal quarters 
we believe that advertising and sponsorship sales will follow a similar pattern with higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters as marketers more aggressively attempt to reach our generation y audience during these major spending seasons 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities as we have generated negative cash flow from operations since our inception 
in may  we raised approximately million in net proceeds upon the closing of our initial public offering 
in april  we raised million in net cash proceeds and acquired  shares of ldig common stock in connection with our sale of  shares of alloy common stock to a subsidiary of ldig 
at january   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and a further million of marketable securities 
our principal commitments at january  consisted of accounts payable  accrued expenses and obligations under operating and capital leases 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the principal use of cash for all periods was to fund our losses from operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal due to the net effect of sales and maturities of marketable securities  offset by the application of million of the proceeds to the purchase of kubic marketing  inc  million of capital expenditures and million of minority investments 
cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal consisted of million for the purchase of marketable securities with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering  million for capital expenditures for computers  office furniture and equipment  million as partial consideration for two business acquisitions  and  for the acquisition of intangible assets consisting of a customer mailing list and a web site domain name 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in fiscal  we received million in net cash proceeds in connection with our sale of  shares of alloy common stock to a subsidiary of ldig 
in fiscal  we received million in net proceeds from our initial public offering  as well as the second million cash installment from the sale of our series a convertible preferred stock to brand equity ventures i  lp 
after the closing of our initial public offering on may   we repaid million of principal on outstanding promissory notes 
in addition  upon the consummation of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
in fiscal  we received million in net proceeds from the issuance of promissory notes and million from the issuance of common stock 
the net cash raised in fiscal  and was partially offset by payments of our capitalized lease obligations 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we build our brand and customer database and that our operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that in light of our liquidity position as of january  consisting of million of cash and marketable securities  together with the million in cash we raised through our issuance of series a preferred stock to spvc vi  our existing working capital and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures  other than potential acquisitions  for at least the next months  although we will consider attractive opportunities to raise additional capital should these opportunities arise 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  financing may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services 
in addition  we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas no 
and its related amendments in sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  is effective for the fiscal year beginning february  in july  we purchased put options and sold call options referred to as collars on a total of  shares of liberty digital  inc ldig common stock  representing a portion of ldig common stock already owned by us as available for sale marketable securities 
the options allow us to sell ldig common stock at various prices and have been designated as a hedge against potential declines in the fair value of ldig common stock 
the options expire on various dates beginning january through july these options have been designated as fair value hedges pursuant to sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 since we have already reflected the fair value of the options outstanding in the financial statements  the impact will be to reflect the fair value of the options as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  as an increase to earnings in the consolidated statement of operations and a corresponding adjustment to remove this amount from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the collars were settled and the underlying ldig stock was sold in march and  accordingly  as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal  there will be no continuing impact of accounting for these derivative instruments 
the net impact of the adoption of sfas on february  and the settlement of the collars and related sale of marketable securities in march will result in a gain of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal we have no other derivative instruments or contracts with embedded derivative features that currently must be considered with respect to sfas nos 
and in july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus with respect to issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the purpose of this issue discussion was to clarify the classification of shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the consensus reached was that all shipping and handling billed to customers is revenue 
we adopted the provisions of this pronouncement in the third quarter of fiscal  and have presented our consolidated statements of operations in accordance with this issue 
furthermore  we reclassified our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended january  and to conform with this consensus as we previously netted shipping and handling revenues with the related costs and included the residual amount as selling and marketing expenses 
the impact of this reclassification resulted in an increase of net merchandise revenues of  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively  offset by an equivalent increase in selling and marketing expenses for these periods 
furthermore  eitf issue no 
requires that if shipping costs or handling costs are significant and are not included in cost of sales  these costs and the line items which include them on the consolidated statements of operations should be disclosed 
we include these costs in selling and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
these costs were   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the eitf is also discussing issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue deals with the accounting for contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue generating activities will be performed 
the eitf is considering how to determine the units of accounting in an arrangement and how to account for the components as well as the direct costs incurred in connection with an arrangement 
the key consideration is the determination of objective measures of fair value 
while this issue was not applicable to historical transactions of alloy  future results may be impacted by applicable arrangements that are within the scope of this issue 
no final consensus has been reached with respect to these matters 
in february  the fasb issued a proposed statement of financial accounting standards entitled  business combinations and intangible assets accounting for goodwill 
it is expected that the final adopted statement will be issued in june under this proposal  all amortization of goodwill will cease  as of the effective date  and goodwill will be accounted for under a new impairment only approach 
the impairment review will be based on measures of fair value and will require charges against earnings in periods when impairments exist 
accordingly  the proposed statement  when issued  will require alloy to discontinue amortization of goodwill and perform periodic impairment reviews  in accordance with the proposed statement 
future results of alloy could be affected by the provisions of this proposed statement when issued and effective 
risk factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our potential for future success 
we were incorporated in january and did not begin to generate meaningful revenues until august accordingly  we have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects 
you must consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as electronic commerce 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of losses  and we may never be profitable 
since our inception in january  we have incurred significant net losses  resulting primarily from costs related to developing our alloy web site and database of generation y names  attracting users to our alloy web site  establishing the alloy brand  hiring employees  making strategic acquisitions and becoming a public company 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
because of our plans to continue to invest heavily in marketing and promotion  including for our ccs web site and brand  to hire additional employees  to enhance our web sites and operating infrastructure and make additional strategic acquisitions  we may incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future 
if our revenue growth is slower than we anticipate or our operating expenses exceed our expectations  our losses will be significantly greater 
we may never achieve profitability 
our stock price may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our revenues for the foreseeable future will remain primarily dependent on sales of merchandise appearing in our catalogs and on our web sites  and secondarily on sponsorship and advertising revenues 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the number of visitors to our web sites  the extent of our merchandise sales or the amount of sponsorship and advertising revenues 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we have already experienced the effects of seasonality on our merchandise sales  which are generally lower in the first and second quarters of each year 
we believe that sponsorship and advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  while our sponsorship and advertising sales have tended to be lower in our fiscal first and second quarters 
if similar seasonal and cyclical patterns emerge in internet sponsorship and advertising spending  these revenues may vary significantly based on these patterns 
other factors which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter include o our ability to attract new and repeat visitors to our web sites and convert them into customers  o price competition  o the level of merchandise returns we experience  o unanticipated cost increases or delays in shipping  transaction processing and catalog production  o unanticipated delays or cost increases with respect to product introductions  o the reduction in consumer spending associated with a general slowdown of the us economy  o the costs  timing and impact of our sales and marketing initiatives  o the costs of integrating businesses we acquire into our company  and o the shifting views of consumers on internet based commerce and internet related companies 
because of these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not good indicators of our future performance 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future periods  our stock price may decline substantially 
our business will suffer if we fail to keep current with generation y fashion and lifestyle trends 
our continued success will depend largely on our ability to keep current with the changing fashion tastes and interests of our generation y customers 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or respond to changes in styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we are likely to experience reduced revenues from merchandise sales 
moreover  the alloy or ccs brands  and our other generation y brands  could be eroded by misjudgments in merchandise selection or a failure to keep our community and content current with the evolving preferences of our audience 
these events would likely reduce the number of visitors to our web sites and limit opportunities for sponsorship and advertising sales 
as a consequence of these potential developments  our business would suffer 
our business may not grow in the future 
since our inception  we have rapidly expanded our operations  growing from total revenues of million in fiscal to total revenues of million in fiscal our continued future growth will depend to a significant degree on our ability to increase revenues from our existing businesses  maintain existing sponsorship and advertising relationships and develop new sponsorship and advertising relationships  expand our product and content offerings to consumers  while maintaining adequate gross margins  and implement other programs that increase the circulation of our print catalogs and generate traffic to our web sites 
our ability to implement our growth strategy will also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are or may be beyond our control  including i our ability to select products that appeal to our customer base and effectively market them to our target audience  ii our ability to make additional strategic acquisitions  iii increasing use of the internet for shopping by consumers  iv the continued perception by participating advertisers and sponsors that we offer an effective marketing channel for their products and services  and v our ability to attract  train and retain qualified employees and management 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy 
our plans for international expansion pose additional risks 
an aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our business internationally  through our catalogs as well as the internet 
we have limited experience in selling our products and services internationally 
such expansion will place additional burdens upon our management  personnel and financial resources and may cause us to incur losses 
we will also face different and additional competition in these international markets 
in addition  international expansion has certain unique risks  such as regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  political instability and potentially adverse tax implications 
to the extent we expand our business internationally  we will also become subject to risks associated with international monetary exchange fluctuations 
any one of these risks could impair our ability to expand internationally as well as have a material adverse impact upon our overall business operations  growth and financial condition 
our planned online and traditional marketing campaigns may not attract sufficient additional visitors to our web sites or may detract from our image 
we plan to continue to pursue aggressive marketing campaigns online and in traditional media to promote the alloy and ccs brands and our other teen brands and to attract an increasing number of visitors to our web sites 
we believe that maintaining and strengthening the alloy and ccs brands  as well as our other teen brands  will be critical to the success of our business 
this investment in increased marketing carries with it significant risks  including the following o our advertisements may not properly convey the alloy or ccs brand images  or the images of our other teen brands  or may even detract from our images 
unlike advertising on our web sites which gives us immediate feedback and allows us promptly to adjust our messages  advertising in print and broadcast media is less flexible 
these advertisements typically take longer and cost more to produce and consequently have longer run times 
if we fail to convey the optimal message in these advertising campaigns  the impact may be more lasting and more costly to correct than on our web sites 
o even if we succeed in creating the right messages for our promotional campaigns  these advertisements may fail to attract new visitors to our web sites at levels commensurate with their costs 
we may fail to choose the optimal mix of television  radio  print and other media to deliver our message cost effectively 
moreover  if these efforts are unsuccessful  we will face difficult and costly choices in deciding whether and how to redirect our marketing dollars cost effectively 
we rely heavily on third parties for essential business operations  and disruptions or failures in service may adversely affect our ability to deliver goods and services to our customers 
general 
we depend on third parties for important aspects of our business  including o internet access  o development of software for new web site features  o content  and o telecommunications 
we have limited control over these third parties  and we are not their only client 
we may not be able to maintain satisfactory relationships with any of them on acceptable commercial terms 
further  we cannot be certain that the quality of products and services that they provide may remain at the levels needed to enable us to conduct our business effectively 
many of our agreements with technology and content providers are on very favorable terms that do not include license fees  but instead provide for revenue sharing 
we may not be able to renew these agreements on similar terms

disruptions or delays in these services could discourage customers from ordering from us in the future and could therefore have a material and adverse effect on our business 
our management is new and may have difficulty managing our expected growth 
in order to execute our business plan  we must continue to grow significantly 
this growth will strain our personnel  management systems and resources 
to manage our growth  we must implement operational and financial systems and controls  and recruit  train and manage new employees 
some key members of our management have only recently been hired 
these individuals have had little experience working with our management team 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to integrate new executives and other employees into our organization effectively 
if we do not manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on our key personnel to operate our business  and we may not be able to hire enough additional management and other personnel as our business grows 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees  particularly matthew c 
diamond  our chief executive officer  james k 
johnson  jr  our chief operating officer and samuel a 
gradess  our chief financial officer 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers could materially and adversely affect our business 
additionally  we believe we will need to attract  retain and motivate talented management and other highly skilled employees to be successful 
competition for employees that possess knowledge of both the internet industry and the generation y market is intense 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
intense competition from internet and catalog based businesses may decrease our market share  revenues and gross margins and cause our stock price to decline 
we face intense competition in electronic commerce  catalog sales and online services 
our web sites and alloy and ccs catalogs compete for generation y customers with traditional department store retailers  catalog retailers  direct marketers  specialty apparel and accessory retailers and discount retailers 
this competition is likely to increase because it is not difficult to enter the online commerce market  and current and new competitors can launch web sites at relatively low cost 
competition could result in price reductions for our products and services  reduced margins or loss of market share 
consolidation within the online commerce industry may also increase competition 
the market for internet users and community services is highly competitive and rapidly evolving 
competition for users and advertisers is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
there are no substantial barriers to entry in these markets 
such competition could result in fewer visitors to our web sites and reduced sponsorship and advertising revenues 
many of our existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer user bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be materially and adversely affected and our stock price will decline 
we may fail to manage successfully and use our databases of web site users and customers 
an important component of our business model involves the use of our lists of catalog requesters and web site registrants to target more effectively direct marketing messages 
we depend upon personal information we collect from our web site users for data we need to create direct mailing and e mailing lists  tailor our web site offerings to the tastes of our generation y users and attract marketers to our web sites 
we must continuously expand and update our lists to identify new  prospective generation y customers 
names derived from purchased or rented lists may generate lower response rates and  therefore  a lower return on our investment in these lists 
we must also continually develop and refine our techniques for segmenting these lists to maximize their usefulness to us and our marketing partners 
if we fail to capitalize on these important business assets  our business model will be less successful 
in addition  laws or regulations that could impair our ability to collect or utilize user names and other information on our web sites may adversely affect our business 
for example  a recently enacted federal law limits our ability to collect personal information from web site visitors who may be under age any violation of this law could result in fines to alloy 
we must effectively manage our vendors to minimize inventory risk and maintain our margins 
in order to fulfill our orders  we depend upon our vendors to produce sufficient quantities of products according to schedule 
we may maintain high inventory levels in some categories of merchandise in an effort to maintain satisfactory fulfillment rates for our customers 
this may expose us to risk of excess inventories and outdated merchandise  which could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
if we underestimate quantities and vendors cannot restock  then we may disappoint customers who may turn to our competitors 
we also negotiate with our vendors to get the best quality available at the best prices and increase our profit margins 
our failure to be able to manage our vendors effectively would adversely affect our operating results 
we may fail to establish and maintain strategic relationships with other web sites to increase numbers of web site users and increase our revenues 
we intend to establish numerous strategic alliances with other popular web sites to increase the number of visitors to our web sites 
there is intense competition for placements on these sites  and we may not be able to enter into these relationships on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
even if we enter into strategic alliances with other web sites  they themselves may not attract significant numbers of users 
therefore  our sites may not receive additional users from these relationships 
moreover  we may have to pay significant fees to establish these relationships 
our inability to enter into new distribution relationships or strategic alliances and expand our existing ones could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to adapt as internet technologies and customer demands continue to evolve 
to be successful  we must adapt to rapidly changing internet technologies and continually enhance the features and services provided on our web sites 
we could incur substantial  unanticipated costs if we need to modify our web sites  software and infrastructure to incorporate new technologies demanded by our audience 
we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our web sites  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to user requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we fail to keep pace with the technological demands of our web savvy audience for new services  products and enhancements  our users may not use our web sites and instead use those of our competitors 
we may not be able to protect and enforce our trademarks  web addresses and intellectual property rights 
our alloy and ccs brand names and our web addresses  www 
alloy 
com and www 
ccs 
com  are critical to our success 
we have registered the alloy and ccs names  along with other trademarks with the us patent and trademark office 
applications for the registration of other trademarks and service marks are currently pending 
we cannot guarantee that any of these trademark applications will be granted 
in addition  we may not be able to prevent third parties from acquiring web addresses that are confusingly similar to our addresses  which could harm our business 
we may experience fluctuations in postage and paper expenses 
catalog production and distribution expenses represented approximately of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended january   and approximately of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended january  a substantial portion of these expenses are attributable to paper and postage costs 
material increases in paper or catalog delivery costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
in january  the united states postal service implemented rate increases of approximately for mailing of our catalogs 
we may be unable to identify and successfully integrate potential acquisitions and investments 
we have acquired eight businesses and we may acquire or make investments in other complementary businesses  products  services or technologies on an opportunistic basis when we believe they will assist us in carrying out our business strategy 
we could have difficulty in assimilating personnel and operations of the businesses we have acquired and may have similar problems in future acquisitions 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired companies may decide not to work for us 
if we acquire products  services or technologies  we could have difficulty in assimilating them into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we are vulnerable to new tax obligations that could be imposed on online commerce transactions 
we do not expect to collect sales or other similar taxes in respect of shipments of goods into most states 
however  various states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales tax obligations on us and other online commerce and direct marketing companies 
a number of proposals have been made at the state and local levels that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of online commerce and cause purchasing through our web site to be less attractive to customers as compared to traditional retail purchasing 
existing legislation limits until october the ability of the states to impose taxes on internet based transactions 
several bills recently have been introduced in the united states congress that would extend such tax moratorium for an additional five years 
other similar bills recently have been introduced to make the moratorium permanent 
similar bills were introduced in the last congress but failed to become law 
failure to renew this moratorium could result in the imposition by various states of taxes on online commerce 
further  states have attempted to impose sales taxes on catalog sales from businesses such as ours 
a successful assertion by one or more states that we should have collected or be collecting sales taxes on the sale of products could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
risks related to the internet industry we are dependent on the continued development of the internet infrastructure 
our industry is new and rapidly evolving 
our business would be adversely affected if internet usage and online commerce does not continue to grow 
internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  including o inadequate internet infrastructure  o inconsistent quality of service  or o unavailability of cost effective  high speed service 
if internet usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth  or its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  web sites  including ours  have experienced a variety of interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages or delays frequently occur in the future  web usage  including usage of our web sites  could grow slowly or decline 
our long term success depends on the development of the online commerce market  and on the increased online purchasing by generation y  both of which are uncertain 
our future revenues and profits substantially depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by consumers 
demand for recently introduced services and products over the internet and online services is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the development of the internet and online services as a viable commercial marketplace is subject to a number of factors  including the following o online commerce is at an early stage and buyers may be unwilling to shift their purchasing from traditional vendors to online vendors  o insufficient availability of telecommunications services or changes in telecommunications services could result in slower response times  and o the inability of our target demographic group to have regular access to a credit card could cause a slower growth in online commerce for us than for companies targeting consumers in general 
adoption of the internet as an advertising medium is uncertain 
the growth of internet sponsorships and advertising requires validation of the internet as an effective advertising medium 
this validation has yet to occur fully 
in order for us to generate sponsorship and advertising revenues  marketers must direct a significant portion of their budgets to the internet and  specifically  to our web sites 
to date  sales of internet sponsorships and advertising represent only a small percentage of total advertising sales 
also  technological developments could slow the growth of sponsorships and advertising on the internet 
for example  widespread use of filter software programs that limit access to advertising on our web site from the internet user s browser could reduce advertising on the internet 
our business  financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected if the market for internet advertising fails to develop or develops slower than expected 
breaches of security on the internet may slow the growth of online commerce and web advertising and subject us to liability 
the need to securely transmit confidential information such as credit card and other personal information over the internet has been a significant barrier to online commerce and communications over the web 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter more people from using the web or from using it to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information  such as purchases of goods or services 
furthermore  decreased traffic and online sales as a result of general security concerns could cause advertisers to reduce their amount of online spending 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could disrupt our business  damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
we could be liable for claims based on unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims 
claims could also be based on other misuses of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
we may need to spend a great deal of money and use other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches 
we could face liability for information displayed on and communications through our web sites and in our print publications 
we may be subjected to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information we publish on our web sites and in our print publications 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against internet companies as well as print publications in the past 
based on links we provide to other web sites  we could also be subjected to claims based upon online content we do not control that is accessible from our web sites 
claims may also be based on statements made and actions taken as a result of participation in our chat rooms or as a result of materials posted by members on bulletin boards at our web sites 
we also offer e mail services  which may subject us to potential risks  such as o liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e mail  o lost or misdirected messages  o illegal or fraudulent use of e mail  or o interruptions or delays in e mail service 
these claims could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
efforts to regulate or eliminate the use of mechanisms which automatically collect information on users of our web site may interfere with our ability to target our marketing efforts and tailor our web site offerings to the tastes of our users 
web sites typically place a tracking program on a user s hard drive without the user s knowledge or consent 
these programs automatically collect data on anyone visiting a web site 
web site operators use these mechanisms for a variety of purposes  including the collection of data derived from users internet activity 
most currently available web browsers allow users to elect to remove these mechanisms at any time or to prevent this information from being stored on their hard drive 
in addition  some commentators  privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of these tracking mechanisms 
any reduction or limitation in the use of this software could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
we could face additional burdens associated with government regulation of and legal uncertainties surrounding the internet 
any new law or regulation pertaining to the internet  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent 
the law governing the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property  copyright  privacy  obscenity  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad 
we also may be subject to future regulation not specifically related to the internet  including laws affecting direct marketers

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
as of the end of fiscal  alloy was exposed to market risk as a result of our holding of  shares of ldig common stock 
market risk with respect to this holding refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in ldig s stock price 
in order to illustrate the effect of changes in ldig s stock price  we provide the following sensitivity analysis 
had the stock price of ldig been lower at january   the value of our ldig holding would have been lower by approximately  in july  we entered into a series of three cashless collars with a financial services institution with respect to  ldig shares owned by us 
each of the cashless collars covers  shares of ldig and has stated terms of approximately months  months and months  respectively 
in effect  we purchased put options that give us the right to require the counterparty to buy  ldig shares from us in to months at an average price of approximately per share 
we simultaneously sold call options giving the counterparty the right to buy  ldig shares from alloy in to months at an average price of approximately per share 
since the purchase price of the put options was equal to the proceeds from the sale of the call options  the collar transactions were at no cost to us 
in march  alloy unwound its collared equity derivative position on  shares of common stock of ldig received in connection with alloy s financing and strategic arrangement with ldig and sold the underlying shares  leaving alloy with no remaining holding of ldig common stock
