the company seeks to increase operating cash flow through both internal growth and selective acquisitions  while maintaining a flexible and conservative capital structure 
in addition to renovating  redeveloping and repositioning the company s acquired hotels  the company may seek to acquire existing or new upscale properties that will benefit from affiliation with one of the premium brands available to the company through its strategic brand owner and manager relationships with hilton hotels corporation hilton  bass and starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc starwood 
on july   the company merged bristol hotel company into felcor  acquiring its primarily full service hotels the merger 
these hotels added more than  rooms and suites to the company s portfolio  more than doubling the company s size 
the merger also provided diversification  both geographically and by asset class  by adding hotels in many of its key markets and broadening its portfolio in the full service  upscale and midscale hotel markets 
in and  the company completed the major portion of its program of renovation  redevelopment and rebranding of hotels  which was undertaken to improve under performing assets and increase revenues 
the company spent nearly million in  million in and million in on renovations  redevelopment  rebrandings  room additions to existing hotels and other hotel improvements 
management believes that its strategy of renovating  redeveloping and rebranding selected hotels continues to be effective in improving revenue performance 
the company s historical results of operations for   and are summarized as follows in millions  except percentages and hotel counts years ended december  percentage change b vs vs b hotels owned at year end revenues income before nonrecurring items a a net income applicable to common shareholders a a funds from operations ffo earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda a includes a reserve of million established for the proposed sale of non strategic hotels described under liquidity and capital resources below 
b reflects the acquisition of the bristol hotels effective july historically the company has been financed primarily with equity  resulting in a conservative financial structure 
the company s emphasis on maintaining this conservative approach is evidenced in part  by the following  as of december  o interest coverage ratio of x o total debt to annual ebitda of x o borrowing capacity under its line of credit of million o consolidated debt equal to of its investment in hotels at cost o fixed interest rate debt comprising of total debt o secured mortgage debt to total assets of o debt of approximately million maturing in on january   the provisions of the reit modernization act became effective 
these provisions o reduce the percentage of taxable income required to be distributed by a reit from to for taxable years after  and o subject to certain limitations  permit a reit to own taxable subsidiaries that engage in businesses previously prohibited to a reit  including  among other things  leasing hotels from a hotel reit  provided that the hotels continue to be managed by unrelated third parties 
as a result of the reit modernization act s enactment  the company  undertook steps to realize the benefits the act offers to reit s by o effective january   acquiring djont which leased of the company s hotels at december  the management contracts for all of the djont leased hotels remained in place 
o effective january   completing the acquisition of leases for hotels leased to bristol and entering into management contracts with a subsidiary of bass for two of the hotels  a subsidiary of interstate hotels corporation for eight hotels  with a subsidiary of hilton for one of the hotels and one hotel was sold 
o effective july   acquiring leases for the remaining hotels leased to bristol and entering into long term management agreements with a subsidiary of bass to manage these hotels 
o contributing the acquired lessee and or leases as acquired  to newly created  wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries trs 
the company believes that the advantages of holding the lessees and leases in a trs include i a more direct relationship with the hotel and the brand managers  ii elimination of potential conflicts of interest and iii the ability to present consolidated hotel level financial reporting 
as a result of the acquisition of the hotel leases the company will report its results of operations showing hotel revenues and expenses rather than percentage lease revenue 
pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  which reflect the acquisition of the hotel leases  are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of felcor lodging trust incorporated appearing elsewhere herein 
results of operations the company actual comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   the company recorded net income of million compared to million for the year ended december  included in expense for the year ended december   is a one time reserve of million related to non strategic hotels that the company has identified as held for sale 
the reserve represents the difference between the net book value of the hotels and their estimated net sale proceeds 
net income excluding the reserve would have been million 
the company s total revenues increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year end december  this increase is principally from increased percentage lease revenues of million  which increased to million from million in the prior year 
changes in the hotels room and suite revenues significantly affect the company because its principal source of revenue historically has been rent payments from the lessees under the percentage leases 
the percentage leases provide for rent based on a percentage of room and suite revenue  food and beverage revenue  food and beverage rents  and in some instances  other hotel revenues 
during and  percentage lease revenue derived from room and suite revenue represented and of total percentage lease revenue  respectively 
revpar  which is a measure of room and suite revenue  increased by in for all hotels 
this increase in revpar resulted from both increases in average daily rate adr at the hotels and increases in occupied rooms occupancy 
for the year ended december   adr increased by over the prior year and occupancy increased by percentage points 
the company s ability to achieve increases in room and suite revenue and revpar at its hotels is affected  among other things  by overall demand in the marketplace  room supply and the success of the company s renovation  redevelopment and rebranding program 
the company had hotels which had undergone renovation  redevelopment or rebranding in either or  which are identified by the company as non comparable hotels 
the non comparable hotels reflected increases in revpar of which was greater than the results for hotels that had not recently undergone renovation 
a more detailed discussion of hotel room and suite revenue is contained in the hotels actual section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally seeks to improve those of its hotels that management believes can achieve increases in room and suite revenue and revpar as a result of renovation  redevelopment and rebranding 
since the beginning of  the company spent nearly million in capital improvements to its hotels 
management attributes much of the improvement in revpar to these capital improvements 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities increased by million in compared to the principal reasons for this increase in were i a million gain recorded in from the development and sale of the brighton beach condominiums at kingston plantation in myrtle beach  south carolina  by an entity in which the company owns a equity interest and ii the operations of a hotel in which the company acquired a equity interest in the fourth quarter of total expenses increased million in the year ended december   to million from million in included in total expenses is a reserve of million  recorded in the second quarter of  related to the non strategic hotels the company has identified as held for sale 
total expenses  excluding the million reserve for sale of non strategic hotels  increased by million  and as a percentage of total revenue increased to from in the major components of the increase in expenses were interest expense  taxes  insurance and other  and depreciation expense 
interest expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to  and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
this increase is principally the result of the following items o the company increased its average debt outstanding in by approximately million over the prior year 
the increase in average debt resulted principally from stock repurchases in of approximately million and capital expenditures in totaling approximately million 
o the average interest rate on the company s indebtedness increased from about in to nearly in o the company capitalized interest related to major renovations of approximately million in  but because of reduced renovation activity in  the company had only million of interest capitalized in taxes  insurance and other increased by million in  compared to the prior year  and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
this increase in expenses was principally from increases in real estate and personal property taxes 
the company s real estate and personal property taxes increased from higher assessed values generally resulting from the major renovations completed over the past three years 
depreciation expense increased by million in  compared to the prior year  and decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
depreciation expense increased principally as a result of additional depreciation related to fixed asset additions of million in and million in the company also recorded gains on the sale of two hotels of million and million for the sale of excess land during the year ended december  and an extraordinary charge of million for the write off of deferred loan costs associated with debt which was retired prior to maturity 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the years and  felcor had total revenue of million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue of million and million 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the company s acquisition and subsequent leasing  pursuant to percentage leases  of interests in more than hotels in  including the hotels that were acquired through the merger on july  the hotels which were acquired during  including those acquired through the merger  accounted for million of the change in percentage lease revenue for the twelve months ended december   compared to the hotels owned throughout both of the years ended december  and produced an increase in percentage lease revenues of million or between and changes in room and suite revenues significantly affect the company because  historically  its principal source of revenue is rent payments from the lessees under the percentage leases 
the percentage leases provide for rent based on a percentage of room and suite revenue  food and beverage revenue  food and beverage rents  and in some instances  other hotel revenues 
in and  percentage lease revenue derived from room and suite revenue represented and of total percentage lease revenue  respectively 
the hotels owned throughout both and increased room and suite revenue by million or in  compared to  and increased revpar by 
the revpar increase was driven by an increase in adr of  despite a slight drop in occupancy of percentage points 
of the hotels  had undergone renovation in either or those renovated hotels reflected increases in adr of and in revpar of  which was greater than the results for hotels that had not undergone renovation 
this reflects both the improvement from renovation and the impact of taking rooms out of service for such renovation 
the company generally seeks to improve those of its hotels that management believes can achieve increases in room and suite revenue and revpar as a result of renovation  redevelopment and rebranding 
however  during the course of such improvements hotel revenue performance is often adversely affected  compared to the prior year  by such temporary factors as rooms and suites out of service and disruptions of hotel operations 
during  felcor spent million on the renovation  redevelopment and rebranding of its hotels 
as a result of the extensive renovations  felcor s portfolio experienced significant disruption during  with approximately  room nights out of service  or of its portfolio 
a more detailed discussion of hotel room and suite revenue is contained in the the hotels actual section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
total expenses increased million in the year ended december   to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the additional hotels acquired in july through the merger 
total expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to for the twelve months ended december   compared to in the major components of the increase in expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  are depreciation  land leases  and interest expense 
depreciation increased  as a percentage of total revenue  to in the twelve months ended december   from in the relative increase in depreciation expense is primarily attributed to depreciation on million in capital expenditures made over the past two years  approximately of which are short lived assets that are depreciated over to years 
land lease expenses represent of total revenue in  as compared to in this increase  as a percentage of total revenue  results primarily from the larger percentage of hotels subject to land leases among those acquired through the merger 
interest expense increased  as a percentage of total revenue  to in the twelve months ended december   from in this increase in interest expense is attributed to the increased debt used to finance renovations  higher interest rates on debt that was refinanced to extend maturities and convert such debt from variable to fixed rates  the assumption of debt related to the more highly leveraged bristol assets  and borrowings to fund the company s stock repurchase program 
general and administrative expenses and taxes  insurance and other expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in and funds from operations and ebitda the company considers funds from operations ffo and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to be key measures of a reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flow as a measure of the company s operating performance and liquidity 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company believes that ffo and ebitda are helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures  to pay dividends and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo and ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor do they necessarily reflect the funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo and ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties

the hotels actual upscale and full service hotels like embassy suites  crowne plaza  holiday inn and holiday inn select  doubletree and doubletree guest suites  and sheraton and sheraton suites hotels account for approximately of the company s percentage lease revenue and of the hotels room and suite revenue 
the company believes that when analyzing the performance of the hotels  looking at comparable hotels is the most meaningful 
the company defines comparable hotels as those not undergoing renovation  redevelopment or rebranding in either of the comparison years 
major renovations generally have an adverse affect on hotel earnings by taking rooms out of service and disrupting hotel operations 
non comparable hotels are those undergoing renovation  redevelopment or rebranding during either year

c hotels held for sale include three djont leased hotels and bristol leased hotels  consisting of two courtyard by marriott hotels  five fairfield inn hotels  six hampton inn hotels  eight holiday branded hotels  and three doubletree guest suites hotels 
for the twelve months ended december   the company s comparable hotels revpar increased compared to the same period in  by 
for the same period  the comparable hotels adr and occupancy increased and percentage points  respectively 
the total hotel portfolio revpar  excluding hotels held for sale  increased 
the adr and occupancy for these hotels increased and percentage points  respectively 
the djont comparable hotels are predominately embassy suites  doubletree and doubletree guest suites  and sheraton hotels 
the bristol comparable hotels are predominately holiday inn and crowne plaza hotels 
the following table shows the comparable hotel revpar changes for the year ended december   compared to  by brand revpar percentage of total change room revenue embassy suites hotels holiday inn hotels crowne plaza hotels doubletree branded hotels sheraton hotels other hotels total hotels the company attributes much of the improvement in revpar to the renovation  rebranding and repositioning program in which the company and  prior to the merger  bristol hotel company has spent nearly million since the beginning of the company s hotels outperformed most other hotels in their respective markets during the year and the company expects its hotels to continue to favorably compare to other hotels in their markets 
through the fourth quarter of  the company s embassy suites hotels had experienced their sixth consecutive quarterly increase in occupancy 
the company s comparable embassy suites hotels achieved a growth in revpar for  compared to the prior year 
these hotels  which provide of the comparable hotel room revenues  increased their adr by and occupancy by percentage points 
the company s comparable doubletree branded hotels had a revpar gain for the year  made up of increases in both occupancy and adr of percentage points and  respectively 
the company believes that  in addition to recent renovations at the majority of these hotels  the hilton promus merger and the addition of the hilton hhonors r guest frequency program has had and will continue to have a positive impact on its embassy suites and doubletree branded hotel revenues 
bass completed its merger with bristol hotels resorts at the end of the first quarter of the company expects the integration of the bristol management team with bass will continue to be beneficial to the development and strengthening of the crowne plaza and holiday brands 
the company s comparable crowne plaza hotels all of which were renovated and rebranded from holiday inn and harvey hotels  reported increased revpar of for  compared to this increase resulted primarily from a percentage point increase in occupancy between the periods 
in addition to the recent renovations  the company attributes a portion of this improvement to the change in marketing for the brand  which now supports the marketing of crowne plaza with the inter continental r brand 
the company s comparable holiday branded hotels increased revpar for the year by 
the increase in revpar resulted from a percentage point increase in occupancy and a increase in adr 
the company s comparable holiday branded hotels with greater than rooms representing nearly of the company s holiday branded revenue reported an increase in revpar of for the full year  which came from occupancy and adr increases of percentage points and  respectively 
approximately of the company s comparable hotel room revenues were derived from four states texas  california  florida and georgia 
changes in comparable hotel revpar during for hotels in these states  compared to the same period in  are illustrated in the following table revpar percentage of total change room revenue texas hotels california hotels florida hotels georgia hotels the comparable hotels in texas  which account for approximately of felcor s comparable hotel total room revenue  experienced the fourth consecutive quarter with positive revpar growth compared to prior year 
the growth in supply from new hotels in most major markets in texas appears to have slowed and management believes that their recently renovated hotels will continue to effectively compete in their market segments 
the company s comparable hotels located in dallas  which had been adversely affected by new competition in recent years  had revpar increases of for the fourth quarter and for the year 
the company s non comparable hotels reported an increase in revpar of for the twelve months ended december  these hotels were profoundly affected by the allerton crowne plaza increased revpar by for the twelve month period  which was closed for renovation in and partially reopened in the second quarter of the non comparable hotels  excluding the allerton  reported increased revpar of 
djont actual comparison of the years ended december  and total revenues increased to million in the twelve months ended december   from million in the same period of  an increase of 
total revenues consisted primarily of room and suite revenue of million and million for the twelve months of and  respectively 
the increase in room and suite revenue of million resulted primarily from an increase in adr of  and an increase in occupancy of income before percentage lease rent increased million for the year ended december   compared to  and expressed as a percentage of total revenue remained constant at for both years 
total expenses before percentage lease rent increased million 
the increase in total expenses before percentage lease rent is principally related to the increased revenues  however  the introduction of hilton s hhonors frequent guest program is one of the reasons that the additional revenues in did not serve to improve margins 
it is believed by management that much of the expense for the new frequency program  in the year of inception  is start up related and should serve to provide more incremental profit in future years 
percentage lease rent increased by million in  compared to  and increased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in percentage lease rent as a percentage of total revenue increased principally because percent rent on incremental room and suite revenues is computed using the highest tier rate  therefore making disproportionate increases in the expense 
djont recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million in management believes that its embassy suites and doubletree branded hotels  collectively hotels  should benefit from the november merger between hilton and promus the brand manager for all but two of djont s embassy suites and doubletree branded hotels 
hilton s upscale hotel experience and integration into hilton s central reservation system  marketing infrastructure and frequent stay program are believed to have the potential to drive both incremental occupancy and rate 
comparison of the years ended december  and total revenues increased to million in the twelve months ended december   from million in the same period of  an increase of 
total revenues consisted primarily of room and suite revenue of million and million in the twelve months of and  respectively 
the increase in total revenues is primarily a result of the acquisition of twelve additional hotels in room and suite revenues from the these hotels  for the twelve months ended december  over  increased or million 
the room and suite revenue for the hotels which were leased for all of and  increased million as a result of an increase in adr of  with a slight decrease in occupancy of 
djont s income before percentage lease rent decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in the twelve months ended december  to in the twelve months ended december  for the twelve months ended december   djont incurred losses of million 
this was largely due to higher labor costs and related payroll benefits  increased reservation costs  and increased fees related to the former crown sterling suite hotels 
percentage lease rent remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in and renovations  redevelopments and rebrandings the company has historically sought to enhance the value of its portfolio through o its practice of upgrading  renovating and or redeveloping most of its recently acquired hotels to enhance their competitive position  and  in certain instances  rebranding them to improve their revenue generating capacity  and o its ongoing program for the maintenance of the company s upgraded hotel assets  which includes o the contribution of approximately of total annual hotel revenue to a capital reserve  for routine capital replacements and improvements  and o ensuring that the lessees adhere to a rigorous maintenance and repair program  resulting in the expenditure of more than of annual hotel revenues on maintenance of the hotels 
renovation and redevelopment program the company has demonstrated its ability to successfully generate returns on investments in renovations 
its renovation and rebranding of the crown sterling suites hotels  which were acquired during and  achieved an overall revpar increase of between and during   and  an aggregate of approximately million in capital improvements and other capital expenditures were made to the company s hotels  with approximately of total hotel room nights being lost due to renovation in  in and in during  the company spent approximately million under its renovation and redevelopment program 
during  the company currently expects to spend approximately million on the renovation of hotels  approximately million to complete renovations started in at hotels  and approximately million for other capital expenditures 
the company is currently reviewing the feasibility of undertaking up to million of additional renovations and room additions during the company currently expects an insignificant number of room nights to be lost during as a result of renovations 
by the end of  the company will have spent more than billion since on renovations and other capital expenditures to its hotel portfolio  which should limit the need for future renovation expenditures primarily to those necessary to maintain the hotels in their upgraded condition or to enhance a hotel s earning capability through room addition or rebranding as deemed appropriate 
capital reserve during  approximately million was contributed to the capital reserve for capital replacements and improvements and approximately million was spent on such replacements and improvements which is in addition to the million spent under the renovation and redevelopment program described above 
repairs and maintenance during the year ended december   approximately million and million were spent by the lessees on routine repairs and maintenance at the hotels leased by djont and bristol  respectively 
this represents approximately of total hotel revenues 
liquidity and capital resources felcor s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders and repayments of indebtedness  has historically been its share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the percentage leases 
for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue  was million and funds from operations was million 
djont recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  djont s accumulated deficit totaled million at december  the losses in the current year are partially attributed to increased costs of frequent guest programs instituted during the year and increased operating costs which resulted in lower than anticipated operating margins 
subject to the receipt of consents from certain lenders  effective january   the company acquired and contributed to a taxable reit subsidiary  all of the equity interests in djont 
in consideration for the acquisition of djont  the operating partnership issued an aggregate of  units of its limited partner interest valued at million based upon the closing share price of felcor common stock on december   to an entity owned by thomas j 
corcoran  jr 
and hervey a 
feldman and to an entity owned by the children of charles n 
mathewson

in consideration for the acquisition of such leases  the company issued to bass  shares of felcor common stock valued at approximately million 
of the hotels  i the company has entered into an agreement with interstate hotels corporation ihc to manage eight of the hotels  ii two hotels are being managed by a subsidiary of bass under short term management contracts  iii one hotel is being managed by a subsidiary of hilton and iv one hotel was sold

a portion of the management fees with respect to the hotels managed by bass under long term management agreements will be considered to be lease termination costs for financial reporting purposes and the company will record a lease termination expense of approximately million in the third quarter of at that time  the company will record a corresponding liability of approximately million that will be amortized over the term of the applicable management agreements 
as a result of the effectiveness of the reit modernization act  which  among other things  allows the company to own its lessees in taxable reit subsidiaries  and the acquisition of the hotel leases in  the company will be reporting the income and expenses of operating hotels rather than lease income from the percentage leases 
any profits or losses from the trs entities holding the hotel leases  after applicable corporate taxes  will be reflected in the company s results of operations
