item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the innsuites hospitality trust consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the innsuites hotels  inc financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the trust is a real estate investment trust which owns the sole general partner interest in the partnership 
in order for the trust to qualify as a reit under prior provisions of the code  neither the trust nor the partnership could operate the hotels 
therefore  each of the hotels was leased to  and operated by  the lessee pursuant to a percentage lease 
each percentage lease obligates the lessee to pay rent equal to the greater of a minimum rent or a percentage rent based on the gross revenues of each hotel 
the lessee also holds the franchise agreement for each hotel 
prior to february   the lessee was owned by innsuites innternational hotels  inc  an entity owned by mr 
wirth and his wife 
effective february   however  the lessee became a wholly owned subsidiary of the trust 
see item business acquisition of the lessee by the trust 
the trust s principal source of cash flows is distributions from the partnership  which are dependent upon lease payments from the lessee pursuant to the percentage leases 
the lessee s ability to make payments to the partnership pursuant to the percentage leases is dependent primarily upon the operations of the hotels 
as a result of the trust s acquisition of the lessee as of february   any profits earned by the lessee in its operation of the hotels may be distributed to the trust 
at january   the trust owned a interest in the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership 
this change in ownership resulted primarily from the following transactions on march   the trust purchased million additional general partner units in the partnership for million 
this transaction was fully funded by mr 
wirth who provided an unsecured loan to the trust at interest payable annually beginning march  the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest is due on march  on april   the partnership made an unsecured loan to the trust in the amount of million 
annual interest only payments are due on march of each year and are based on a interest rate 
the unpaid principal balance is due at maturity on april  the trust used the proceeds of that loan to purchase million general partner units in the partnership 
the money lent by the partnership was generated by refinancing the northern phoenix hotel and borrowing an additional million that was secured by a mortgage on that property 
the original mortgage note was restructured to match the terms of the refinanced note  which bears interest at and matures on april  monthly principal and interest payments began on april  as of april   the trust transferred  at historical cost  its interest in the scottsdale property to the partnership approximately million in exchange for million general partner units 
as a result of the aforementioned transactions  the trust increased its ownership interest in the partnership from approximately to approximately as of april  other incremental  less material  transactions have contributed to the increase from to the trust s sole general partner s interest in the partnership at january  the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees and depreciation of the hotels 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
the percentage leases provide for the payment of base rent and percentage rent 
for the year ended january   base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million was earned by the trust 
the principal determinant of percentage rent is the lessee s room revenues at the hotels  as defined by the percentage leases 
therefore  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available known as revpar  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the percentage leases 
adr decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal due to management s efforts to increase occupancy 
occupancy increased to in fiscal from in fiscal year as a result management s concerted effort to drive occupancy with a more competitive adr 
this resulted in an increase in revpar of to in fiscal from in fiscal the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated 
for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

loss on impairment of hotel property was million for the twelve months ended january  this loss resulted from the write down for a partial impairment of a hotel asset of million 
recent performance of the scottsdale hotel property indicated that the hotel asset may have significantly decreased in value  which then required management to test the asset for recoverability of book value under sfas no

the partnership s principal source of revenue is rent payments under the percentage leases 
the lessee s obligations under the percentage leases are unsecured and its ability to make rent payments to the partnership under the percentage leases  and the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of the lessee to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
as a result of the trust s acquisition of the lessee as of february   any profits earned by the lessee in its operation of the hotels may be distributed to the trust 
see item business acquisition of the lessee by the trust above 
for the twelve months ended january  and  the trust recorded provisions of approximately million and million for uncollectible receivables 
these charges reflect the trust s assessment of the collectibility of its receivables  which primarily consists of rent receivable from the lessee  based on an evaluation of the lessee s estimated future cash flows 
as of january   the trust has no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements set aside annually  as described below 
the trust intends to acquire and develop additional hotels and expects to incur indebtedness to fund those acquisitions and developments 
the trust may also incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from the trust s investments are insufficient to make the required distributions 
on april   the trust obtained a million credit facility from pacific century bank to assist it in its funding of the acquisition and development of additional hotels and for certain other business purposes 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by first mortgages on three of the hotels 
as of january   the trust had drawn million from the credit facility  which charges interest at a variable interest rate 
by its terms  the credit facility expired on april  during the third quarter of fiscal  the trust was notified that pacific century bank would not renew the credit facility when it expired on april  due to a decision by pacific century bank to cease funding hospitality operations 
pacific century bank also announced that it would commence selling its arizona branches 
in order to replace the liquidity provided by the credit facility  the trust actively sought individual loans on the tucson oracle  flagstaff and scottsdale properties that secure the credit facility 
on april   the trust refinanced its ontario property and utilized million of the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance of the credit facility from million to million 
on april   the trust closed the financing of its tucson oracle property and used million of the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance of the credit facility to approximately million 
pacific century bank has proposed the issuance of a term loan to replace the portion of the credit facility that is secured by the flagstaff and scottsdale properties 
the terms of the replacement term loan are subject to review and approval by pacific century bank 
if  for any reason  pacific century bank does not issue the replacement term loan  the trust has sufficient unencumbered equity in the flagstaff and scottsdale properties to refinance the million outstanding balance of the credit facility with another lending institution and therefore satisfy the outstanding balance of the credit facility 
in the unlikely event that pacific century bank forecloses on the flagstaff and scottsdale properties  management believes that the unencumbered equity will be sufficient to prevent a loss at a foreclosure sale 
pacific century bank has agreed to waive all covenants relating to the credit facility and to extend the effectiveness of the credit facility until july  to structure the replacement term loan to be secured by the flagstaff and scottsdale properties 
the terms of the credit facility required the trust to maintain a net worth combined with minority interest of not less than million and  as of the end of each fiscal quarter  maintain a debt to net worth ratio of not greater than to  a net operating income to debt service relating to encumbered properties ratio of not less than to  and a net operating income to debt service ratio of not less than to the trust was permitted to prepay the credit facility  subject to a prepayment penalty of plus a yield maintenance penalty 
during the term of the credit facility  the trust could not further encumber its collateral  sell its collateral  change the nature of its business or unreasonably suspend its business 
on december  and again on april   the trust notified pacific century bank that the trust was not in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in the credit facility 
the trust applied for  and received  waivers of such noncompliance from pacific century bank 
the trust may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
the trust will acquire or develop additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise  and the trust will not undertake acquisition or redevelopment of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of shares of beneficial interest or other securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the trust will successfully acquire or develop additional hotels 
effective august   albuquerque suite hospitality  llc  a owned subsidiary of the partnership  purchased the suite best western airport inn located in albuquerque  new mexico for million 
the funds utilized for the purchase price were secured by a first mortgage on the albuquerque hotel in the amount of  and the remaining amount was loaned by mr 
wirth and his affiliates to the trust 
on april   the mortgage note payable to bank one on the tucson st 
mary s hotel matured 
the outstanding principal balance was  bank one has proposed an extension of the term of the mortgage note for twelve months until april  the extended note will bear interest at the bank one prime rate plus one percent 
on april   the bank one prime rate was seven and one half percent 
these terms are subject to formal review and approval by the bank one credit committee 
if  for any reason  bank one does not extend the mortgage note  the trust has sufficient unencumbered equity in the tucson st 
mary s property to refinance the outstanding balance of the mortgage note with another lending institution and therefore satisfy the outstanding balance of the mortgage note 
in the unlikely event that bank one forecloses on the tucson st 
mary s property  management believes that the unencumbered equity will be sufficient to prevent a loss at a foreclosure sale 
the partnership continues to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund from the rent paid under the percentage leases  an amount equal to of the lessee s revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  in addition to other uses of amounts in the fund considered appropriate from time to time 
the partnership anticipates making similar arrangements with respect to future hotels that it may acquire or develop 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the trust considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts have been capitalized and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the lessee also spent approximately million and million  during fiscal years and  respectively  on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
management believes that cash on hand  future cash receipts and borrowings from affiliates in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s expansion plans and to pay all obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
new accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which established standards for the accounting and reporting for all derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measured at fair value  and that recognition of gains and losses are required on hedging instruments based on changes in fair value or the earnings effect of forecasted transactions 
this new standard  as amended by sfas no 
and no 
 is effective beginning january  this pronouncement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
which summarizes the sec staff s views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
was amended by sab no 
a and no 
no 
b in march and june   respectively  to delay the implementations date of sab no 
until no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted the provisions of sab no 
and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
the interpretation clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
in certain situations  as defined 
the interpretation was effective july   but covers certain events having occurred after december  we have adopted this interpretation and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation the trust s revenues are based on the percentage leases which result in changes in the trust s revenues based on changes in the underlying hotel revenues 
therefore  the trust relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessee s ability to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and the lessee in particular  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessee s ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
the six southern arizona hotels experience their highest occupancy in the first fiscal quarter and  to a lesser extent  the fourth fiscal quarter 
the second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest occupancy period at those six southern arizona hotels 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the trust s quarterly lease revenue under the percentage leases 
the hotels located in northern arizona  california and new mexico historically experience their most profitable periods during the second and third fiscal quarters the summer season  providing some balance to the general seasonality of the hotel business 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  because of temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  the trust may utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to make distributions to its shareholders 
no assurance can be given that the trust will make distributions in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks and other notes payable 
the proceeds from these loans were used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand the trust s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the trust s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the trust borrows using fixed rate debt  when possible 
the trust could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
to date  the trust has not entered into any such derivative transactions 
the trust s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair value and other terms required  by year of expected maturity  in order to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fiscal debt type thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt         average interest rate variable rate debt       interest rate available on january  approximately  of debt was repaid by february  and is not included in the aforementioned summary 
the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt were determined based on current rates offered for fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt with similar risks and maturities 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of january  and does not consider those exposures or positions which would arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the trust s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and future interest rates
