item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
management s discussion of income the consolidated statements of income included in item of this annual report summarize the operating performance of lafarge corporation for the past three years 
to facilitate analysis  net sales and operating profit are discussed by operating segment and are summarized in the table below 
see segment and related information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further segment information 
our three operating segments are construction materials the production and distribution of construction aggregate  ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and asphalt and the construction and paving of roads 
cement and cementitious materials the production and distribution of portland and specialty cements and cementitious materials and the processing of fuel quality waste and alternative raw materials for use in cement kilns 
lafarge gypsum the production and distribution of gypsum drywall and related products 
years ended december in millions net sales construction materials    cement and cementitious materials    gypsum eliminations total    gross profit construction materials cement and cementitious materials gypsum total operational overhead and other expenses construction materials cement and cementitious materials gypsum total income from operations construction materials cement and cementitious materials gypsum total corporate and unallocated expenses earnings before interest and taxes assets construction materials    cement and cementitious materials   gypsum corporate  redland goodwill and unallocated assets total    year ended december  net sales our net sales increased by percent in to  million from  million in us net sales remained relatively unchanged from levels at  million as the result of several factors lower ready mixed concrete and cement sales volumes due to poor weather conditions in the fourth quarter and lower average selling prices for gypsum drywall 
these factors were mostly offset by aggregate sales volumes from the presque isle acquisition and increased ready mixed concrete and cement average selling prices due to implemented increases and changes in product mix 
canadian net sales were million  an increase of million or percent 
the increase was due to improving economic conditions in eastern canada  increased infrastructure spending and project work in british columbia and a strong oil and gas marketplace in northern alberta  which helped improve ready mixed concrete  aggregate and cement sales volumes and average selling prices 
construction materials net sales from construction materials operations in the us and canada were  million  an increase of percent from overall ready mixed concrete shipments to customers were million cubic yards in  percent higher than  and aggregate sales volumes were million tons  percent higher than in the us  net sales increased by million  or percent  to million 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes decreased by percent 
average selling prices for ready mixed concrete in the us regions increased by percent due to implemented price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
aggregate sales volumes in the us increased by percent  of which percent was due to growth in our existing operations with the remainder coming from volumes associated with the presque isle  michigan quarry acquired in june despite general price increases  average selling prices decreased by percent when compared to the reduced selling price was due to increased sales of lower valued products and the impact of the presque isle quarry  which  because of its product mix  brought with it lower average prices than existing us operations 
in canada  net sales increased by million  or percent  to million  reflecting an increase in both sales volumes and average selling prices 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes in canada increased percent from levels and average selling prices increased by percent 
sales volumes increased over primarily due to increased project work 
the increase in average selling price resulted from general price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
canadian aggregate sales volumes were percent ahead of levels and average selling prices increased percent 
volumes increased due to a strong market in ontario  and higher infrastructure spending  increased activity in the oil and gas sector and project work in western canada 
the average selling price increase was mainly due to a shift in the product mix to more premium products 
cement and cementitious materials net sales from cement operations increased by percent to  million from  million in due to higher average selling prices 
cement sales volumes declined by million tons to million tons  which represents a percent decline  while the average selling price per ton to customers  net of freight costs net realization  increased by percent 
us net sales decreased by million to million 
cement shipments through september were ahead of last year  but due to a percent decline in the fourth quarter brought on by heavy snowfall and extremely cold weather  annual cement shipments declined percent 
net realization in the us increased only percent due to competitive pressures in our markets 
canadian cement sales increased percent to million from million in cement shipments in canada increased by percent and net realization rose by percent 
the improvement in volumes was primarily due to a strong northern alberta market  again in oil and gas infrastructure spending  increased oil well cement sales and expanded project work 
the increase of net realization resulted from improved product mix and annual price increases 
also included in sales of our cement operations are sales of cementitious material of million  representing million tons of slag and fly ash 
this represents a percent increase in sales from gypsum despite a percent increase in sales volumes  net sales from gypsum operations decreased by percent to million from million in average selling prices declined nearly percent compared to due to increased capacity in the industry and lower demand  with year end prices more than percent below those at year end the volume increase is due to million square feet of drywall sold from our new silver grove  kentucky plant  which started production in june this increase was mostly offset by reduced sales of imported drywall and a decline in sales of drywall from our newfoundland  canada plant 
a new drywall plant in northern florida began operating in early gross profit and cost of goods sold gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent in  reflecting a significant decline in gypsum results and modest reductions in the cement operations 
construction materials gross margin remained at percent in this was due to higher ready mixed concrete average selling prices in the us and canada and higher aggregate average selling prices in canada 
these factors were offset by higher material and fuel costs in all regions and increased operating costs in the western us and in eastern and western canada  as well as lower aggregate average selling prices in the us cement gross profit declined to percent compared to percent in the decline was the result of a percent increase in cash production cost per ton partially offset by higher average selling prices 
in the us  cash production cost per ton increased slightly compared to in canada  cash production cost per ton increased by percent  primarily due to increased natural gas costs at the exshaw  alberta plant and increased maintenance and purchased clinker costs at the bath  ontario plant  partially offset by lower maintenance and fuel costs and other operating efficiencies associated with the new kiln at the richmond  british columbia plant 
the following table summarizes our cement and clinker production in millions of tons and the clinker production capacity utilization rate years ended december cement production clinker production clinker capacity utilization cement production was essentially in line with  while clinker production was percent higher than us cement production totaled million tons  down percent 
clinker capacity utilization at us plants declined to percent due to increases in capacity at several plants and slightly reduced production 
canadian cement production was million tons  up percent 
canadian clinker capacity utilization decreased to percent from percent 
this decline was due to an increase in capacity  compared to prior year  at the richmond  british columbia plant 
lafarge gypsum s gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by percentage points to percent  primarily due to erosion of selling prices during resulting from increased capacity in the industry  slowing demand  costs associated with the start up of two new production facilities  as well as increased raw material and energy costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in the increase was due to growth in our construction materials business  increased staffing particularly in the human resource and strategic development functions  the restructuring of the canadian gypsum operations  increased costs to support the billion square foot increase of gypsum drywall production capacity  costs associated with establishing a shared service center in our construction materials operations and the study and integration of several acquisitions throughout the year 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to percent from percent in goodwill amortization amortization of goodwill was million in both and we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we expect to amortize the remaining goodwill over periods ranging from to years  based on the expected economic lives of the assets purchased 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consists of items such as equity income and gains and losses from divestitures 
other income expense  net  was a gain of million in compared with a gain of million in the million increase was primarily due to increased pension income of million  lower post retirement benefits costs of million and higher gains on asset dispositions of million 
performance by line of business construction materials operating profit from construction materials operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  million higher than the improvement was due to higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes and higher average selling prices for ready mixed concrete 
these items were partially offset by higher liquid asphalt  diesel and natural gas costs in most regions 
the significant increase in the cost of natural gas  diesel and liquid asphalt  as well as the costs associated with implementing a number of management training programs and establishing a shared service center for accounting and transaction processing  impacted year operating profit by approximately million 
us operations earned million  million better than this increase was due to higher aggregate sales volumes of percent  higher average selling prices for ready mixed concrete of percent and lower depreciation expense  partially offset by reduced ready mixed concrete sales volumes of percent  and increased material  delivery and overhead costs 
earnings in the eastern us were favorably impacted by the acquisition of the presque isle quarry in june and the divestment of the unprofitable maryland paving operations in in the western us  earnings were below prior year due to increased aggregate operating costs  primarily in central missouri  reduced ready mixed concrete sales volumes from poor weather conditions in the fourth quarter in the majority of our major markets and lower average selling prices for aggregate 
the canadian operations earned million  million better than  primarily reflecting higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes of percent and percent  respectively  and higher average selling prices of percent and percent  respectively  partially offset by increased material  delivery and overhead costs 
cement and cementitious materials operating profit from cement operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  a million or percent decline from the decline was due to lower cement sales volumes and higher energy and operating costs  partially offset by increased net realization due to general price increases 
for the full year  energy cost increases for process fuel and delivery totaled approximately million 
the most significant impact was at our exshaw  alberta plant 
in the us  where we burn primarily coal and petroleum coke  the process fuel cost increase was limited 
however  freight costs  particularly in the second half of the year  were affected more significantly 
in the us  operating profit was million  million percent lower than the decline resulted from lower cement sales volumes of percent due largely to poor weather in the fourth quarter and increased transportation costs 
our canadian cement operations reported an operating profit of million  million higher than in  primarily due to increased sales volumes of percent and net realization of percent which was largely offset by rising fuel costs and increased maintenance and purchased clinker at the bath  ontario plant 
operating profit from our cementitious business slag and fly ash included in the cement results was million  an increase of million from gypsum our gypsum drywall operations reported an operating loss of million  a million decline from last year s operating profit of million 
the swing in profitability was due to declining drywall prices  rising raw material costs  increased energy costs  costs associated with the start up of the new silver grove  kentucky plant in  preparations to start up the new palatka  florida plant in  and additional administrative and marketing costs required to support a billion square foot increase in production capacity 
average selling prices declined nearly percent compared to with year end prices off more than percent from a year ago 
earnings before interest and taxes ebit in  ebit was million  a million percent decline from this drop in profitability was due to the million swing in our gypsum segment s results 
through the first three quarters of  improvements in our construction materials and cement segments largely offset the reduction in gypsum profitability 
however  heavy snowfall and extremely cold weather in the last quarter reversed these earlier gains 
ebit in the us was million  million lower than ebit from canadian operations was million  million higher than interest expense interest expense decreased by million in to million primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest 
interest capitalized was million and million in and  respectively 
interest income interest income increased million in this increase is composed of million of interest receivable from the canadian customs and revenue agency recorded as the result of the settlement of transfer pricing and cost sharing issues for the to calendar years see income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
this was partially offset by lower average canadian short term investment balances during income taxes income tax expense decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to lower profits in in the united states and a reduction in our effective income tax rate to percent in from percent in net income we reported net income of million in compared with million in the major reason for the decline in profitability was the losses incurred in our gypsum operations  as well as higher energy costs and higher selling and administrative expenses 
general outlook we expect earnings to improve in  as most sectors of construction in the us still appear to be fairly strong  particularly highway and public works construction 
residential construction  which is expected to weaken in  should benefit from the recent reduction in interest rates 
as the only nationwide supplier of construction materials in canada  we are encouraged by projections that the economy in canada will grow faster than in the us this year  aided in part by a new round of tax cuts 
the outlook for our construction materials operations in is positive 
we expect demand for construction aggregate  ready mixed concrete and our other products and services to remain high in the markets we serve 
in  we should benefit from a full year of operations of the presque isle acquisition and the warren paving merger 
in addition  we expect operating profits to strengthen as one time investment costs  expended in  involving training programs and the establishment of a shared service center for accounting and transaction processing  have been completed 
we believe that us cement consumption in will remain at or close to the record levels achieved in while we expect new residential construction to decline somewhat in  tea funding continues to be appropriated by the federal government  and we believe the outlook for road and highway construction in a number of our key markets is positive for our expanding cementitious business slag and fly ash is becoming more important in our portfolio and should have a positive influence in in our gypsum business  the key unknown factor for is the evolution of selling prices 
recently announced price increases are a positive sign and may indicate that prices are stabilizing 
with our two new drywall plants operating in and with the action plans we have implemented to improve efficiency and reduce costs  we believe that our gypsum operating performance should improve in year ended december  net sales net sales increased by percent in to  million from  million in us net sales increased percent to  million 
the improvement in us sales was primarily due to the continuation of favorable economic conditions supporting demand in all three segments 
sales volumes and prices generally increased in construction materials  cement and gypsum 
canadian net sales were million  an increase of million or percent 
the increase was due to the improving economic conditions in eastern canada  higher cement and ready mix concrete prices  and increased aggregate volumes and prices 
other positive factors improving canadian sales included the gypsum segment s purchase of a gypsum drywall factory and a joint compound manufacturing facility 
these increases were partially offset by a slight decline of percent in the average value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and lower sales in western canada 
construction materials net sales from construction materials operations in the us and canada were  million  which represents an increase of percent from ready mixed concrete shipments to customers in the us and canada were million cubic yards in  percent higher than  while aggregate sales volumes of million tons were essentially unchanged from last year 
in the us  net sales increased by million or percent to million 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes increased by percent as most major markets posted gains 
average selling prices in the us regions increased by percent due to increased sales of higher valued ready mixed concrete 
aggregate sales volumes in the us decreased by percent while average selling prices increased by percent when compared to the decrease in aggregate sales volumes despite overall healthy demand was accounted for by softness in some key markets  such as new mexico  ohio and maryland 
in canada  net sales increased by million or percent 
this increase reflects an increase in the average selling price of most products 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes in canada increased percent from levels while average selling prices increased by percent 
in eastern canada  sales volumes were percent higher and average selling prices were slightly higher than levels 
several acquisitions in as well as increased project work and mild weather combined to increase sales 
western canada ready mixed concrete volumes were below prior year by percent  however  average selling prices increased by percent 
the volume decline was primarily due to the weak economy in british columbia and depressed commodity prices for most of the year in the prairie provinces 
canadian aggregate sales volumes were percent ahead of levels and average selling prices increased percent 
volumes in eastern canada increased by percent with an average selling price increase of percent 
the average selling price increase was mainly due to a shift in the product mix to premium products coupled with strong prices in recently acquired operations 
aggregate volumes in western canada remained relatively flat while average selling prices increased only slightly  mainly due to the weak economic conditions in british columbia 
cement and cementitious materials net sales from cement operations increased by percent to  million from  million in due to higher sales volumes and average selling prices 
cement sales volumes increased by million tons to million tons  which represents a percent increase  while the average selling price per ton to customers net of freight costs net realization increased by percent 
us net sales increased by million to million  an percent improvement  which reflects high levels of construction spending 
cement shipments advanced percent as most major markets posted gains 
net realization in the us increased percent 
canadian cement sales increased percent to million from million 
cement shipments in canada increased by percent while net realization increased by percent 
in eastern canada  cement sales volumes and net realization increased by percent and percent  respectively 
cement shipments in the atlantic provinces were percent higher than in primarily due to increased commercial and public works projects 
quebec and ontario experienced increased shipments of percent and percent  respectively  due to increases in residential and commercial construction related to continued strengthening of the provincial economies 
in western canada  cement shipments were percent lower than  reflecting weaker demand in all major markets 
the two major factors were the negative impact on british columbia of the depressed asian economy  low world commodity prices and lower sales of oil well cement due to a decline in drilling activity 
gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in strong market demand in the residential and commercial construction sectors resulted in average selling price increases of percent 
volumes also increased by percent to million square feet 
due to productivity improvements  both us gypsum plants achieved record production levels for the second straight year 
volumes from existing facilities in wilmington  delaware and buchanan  new york rose by million square feet or percent 
volumes from the recently acquired drywall plant in newfoundland  canada and volumes of imported drywall of million and million square feet  respectively  accounted for the remaining increase 
we announced the construction of two state of the art gypsum drywall plants in northern kentucky and northern florida during the year 
when the plants begin operating in mid and early  respectively  lafarge s gypsum drywall capacity should increase to more than billion square feet per year 
gross profit and cost of goods sold gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to percent from percent in  reflecting improvements in most major product lines 
construction materials gross profit was comparable to at percent 
the us and canada both experienced higher aggregate and ready mixed concrete average selling prices 
these were offset by higher material costs in all regions and increased operating costs in the eastern and western us and in western canada 
cement gross profit was percent compared with percent in the improvement resulted from higher average selling prices partially offset by a percent increase in cash production cost per ton 
in canada  cash production cost per ton increased by percent primarily due to increased maintenance and higher power costs at the woodstock  ontario plant  and increased fuel costs at the exshaw  alberta and the old richmond  british columbia plants 
in addition  costs were negatively impacted by costs associated with the start up of the new kiln at the richmond plant 
these were partially offset by a slight improvement in cash production cost per ton in the us cement cost per ton is heavily influenced by plant capacity utilization 
the following table summarizes our cement and clinker production in millions of tons and the clinker production capacity utilization rate years ended december cement production clinker production clinker capacity utilization cement and clinker production were and percent higher than  respectively 
us cement production totaled million tons  up percent 
clinker capacity utilization at us plants increased to percent from percent as several us plants established clinker production records 
production capacity increased in compared with with the acquisition of the seattle  washington plant in the fourth quarter of the alpena  michigan plant experienced a significant production increase due to increased efficiencies 
canadian cement production was million tons  up percent 
canadian clinker capacity utilization increased to percent from percent 
these improvements were due to higher cement and clinker production at five of the seven canadian cement plants 
the largest increases are attributed to the brookfield  nova scotia and the woodstock  ontario plants producing with two kilns 
lafarge gypsum s gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by percentage points to percent 
this was primarily due to four price increases during the year resulting from favorable market conditions 
for the second straight year  both us plants set production records in these favorable factors were offset somewhat by the impact of the higher costs associated with the imported drywall and lower margins associated with the new canadian operations 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in the increase was due to the purchase and integration of several acquisitions throughout the year  financial system upgrades in all segments and an increase in consulting fees paid due to the year compliance program 
additionally  gypsum operations saw increases due to the implementation of changes to their marketing  administrative and customer service areas that were necessary to support the planned growth of the gypsum division 
despite this  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales remained unchanged from at percent 
goodwill amortization amortization of goodwill was million in compared with million in we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we expect to amortize the remaining goodwill over periods ranging from to years  based on the expected economic lives of the assets purchased 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consists of items such as equity income and gains and losses from divestitures 
other income expense  net  was a gain of million in compared with an expense of million in other income expense  net  increased primarily as a result of favorable nonrecurring gains  including the settlement of an outstanding insurance claim and the gain on the sale of asphalt and paving operations in maryland and the absence of certain nonrecurring expenses incurred in performance by line of business construction materials operating profit from construction materials operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  million higher than the improvement was due to higher ready mixed concrete sales volumes in both the us and canada and higher average selling prices for ready mixed concrete and aggregate in the us and canada  partially offset by higher material and delivery costs in most regions 
us operations earned million  million better than due to increased ready mixed concrete sales volumes of percent and higher average selling prices for both ready mixed concrete and aggregate of percent and percent  respectively  partially offset by reduced aggregate volumes of percent and increased material and delivery costs 
the canadian operations earned million  million better than  primarily reflecting higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes of percent and percent  respectively  and higher average selling prices of percent and percent  respectively 
in eastern canada  higher shipments and increased average selling prices in all markets contributed to higher earnings 
earnings in western canada were below prior year due to lower ready mixed concrete sales volumes and increased material costs partially offset by increased average selling prices 
cement and cementitious materials operating profit from cement operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  a million or percent improvement from in the us  operating profit was million  million or percent higher than the improvement was due to percent higher shipments and a percent increase in net realization partly offset by higher plant costs and increased clinker and cement purchases to supplement production 
of the percent increase in cement shipments  percent was due to the acquisition of the seattle  washington cement plant on october  our canadian cement operations reported an operating profit of million  million worse than in primarily due to reduced volumes in western canada 
this was partially offset by increased volumes in eastern canada 
canadian cement cash cost per ton was percent higher than levels mainly due to increased maintenance and higher power costs at the woodstock  ontario plant  increased contract work due to the start up of the new kiln at the richmond  british columbia plant and higher fuel costs at the exshaw  alberta plant 
gypsum our gypsum drywall operations reported an operating profit of million  which was more than double last year s operating profit of million 
operating margins increased from percent in to percent in primarily due to a strong market throughout the year that supported four price increases 
the existing plants also improved operating efficiencies 
earnings before interest and taxes ebit in  ebit was million  a million or percent improvement from  reflecting better results in most of our operations 
growing cement volumes in the us and eastern canada  outstanding results of lafarge gypsum and higher profits in our construction materials business in colorado and eastern canada contributed to the improvement 
ebit in the us was million  million better than in ebit from canadian operations was million  million lower than as a depressed western canadian economy offset the gains realized in eastern canada 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in to million primarily due to a full year s interest on million of external debt issued in july see the notes to consolidated financial statements to finance the redland acquisition 
interest capitalized was million and million in and  respectively 
interest income interest income decreased million in primarily due to lower average canadian short term investment balances 
income taxes income tax expense increased from million in to million in due to higher profits in both the us and canada 
our effective income tax rate was percent in and percent in net income we reported net income of million in compared with million in the percent improvement resulted from higher volumes in most of our product lines 
higher cement  ready mixed concrete  aggregate and gypsum drywall average selling prices also contributed to the improvement 
these increases were partially offset by higher interest expense and higher selling and administrative expenses 
other factors affecting the company environmental matters our operations  like those of our competitors  are subject to state  federal  local and canadian environmental laws and regulations  which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts  and require pollution control and prevention  site restoration and operating permits and or approvals to conduct certain of our operations 
federal environmental laws that impose liability for remediation include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  which together are referred to as superfund  and the corrective action provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra 
under superfund s current broad liability provisions  the us environmental protection agency epa may commence a civil action against potentially responsible parties prps or order prps to remediate sites containing hazardous substances and pollution associated with past or ongoing practices 
under superfund  strict liability for cleanup costs can be imposed even if a prp was not directly responsible for site conditions 
in addition  the liability is joint and several  which means that the epa can seek the entire cost of cleaning up a site from one prp  even if other prps were responsible for a substantial portion of the contamination 
some of the environmental laws intended to control or prevent pollution include the pollution control provisions of rcra controlling solid and hazardous wastes  the clean water act controlling discharge of pollutants into the waters of the us and the clean air act controlling emission of pollutants into the atmosphere 
to prevent  control and remediate environmental problems and maintain compliance with permitting requirements  we maintain an environmental program designed to monitor and control environmental matters 
this program is based upon our environmental policy and includes recruitment  training and retention of personnel experienced in environmental matters 
company employees are responsible for identifying potential environmental issues and bringing them to the attention of management who are responsible for addressing environmental matters 
in this regard  we require local regional management to immediately report to corporate management any spills or material instances of non compliance 
further  routine environmental matters are required to be reported quarterly 
if necessary  we engage outside consultants to determine an appropriate course of action and estimate the likely financial exposure presented by the environmental matter 
we routinely audit our properties to determine whether remediation is required  the adequacy of accruals for such remediation  the status of remedial activities and whether improvements to the site are required to meet current and future permit or other requirements under the environmental laws 
our program also includes an environmental recognition award program  an environmental report  and a voluntary environmental partnership with the world wildlife fund focusing on biodiversity  indicators to measure continuing environmental improvement  and development of a co reduction initiative 
we are involved in one superfund remediation 
at this site  which the epa has listed on the national priority list  several prps have initiated an action against other parties  including us 
the suit alleges that a predecessor of ours sold equipment containing hazardous substances that may now be present at the site 
it appears that the us department of defense is the largest disposer and that many others may have disposed large amounts of hazardous substances at this site 
our management believes that this matter is not material to us 
in  the epa delisted a site where we were a potentially responsible party and remedial activities had been completed 
in december  an action was filed against us and five others to recover response activity costs incurred by the state of michigan in responding to alleged releases of hazardous substances from air scrubber baghouse bags at a site in michigan 
we are vigorously defending this action and believe it will not materially impact us 
we may also be involved in certain environmental enforcement matters 
during  no material enforcement matters were initiated  resolved or outstanding 
we record environmental accruals when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
environmental remediation accruals are based on internal studies and estimates  including shared financial liability with third parties 
accruals are adjusted when further information or additional studies warrant 
environmental accruals are undiscounted estimates of required remediation costs without offset of potential insurance or other claims 
when such recoveries become probable  those amounts are reflected as receivables in the financial statements  and are not netted against the accruals 
recorded environmental liabilities are not material to us 
while we believe the possibility of incurring material environmental liability in excess of recorded amounts is remote  we may incur environmental costs in excess of amounts recorded at december  environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
for the years ended december   and  our environmental capital expenditures and remediation expenses were not material 
however  our environmental expenditures have increased and are likely to increase in the future 
currently  proposed changes or new environmental laws or regulations include promulgation of revised epa boiler and industrial furnaces regulations under rcra and the maximum achievable control technology provision of the clean air act  promulgation of new cement kiln dust management standards under rcra and implementation under state solid waste laws and regulations  promulgation of final clean air act maximum achievable control technology regulations governing air toxic emissions from non waste burning cement plants  state revisions of clean air act state implementation plans to require nox reductions for cement plants operating in certain areas east of the mississippi  state revisions of clean air act state implementation plans to require reduction of particulate matter particles microns or less from our various operations  new permit requirements under title v of the clean air act  and the potential us senate ratification and enactment of legislation to implement the kyoto protocol which may require us to reduce co emissions 
we cannot presently determine whether these proposed changes will require capital expenditures or other remedial actions  or the effect of such changes on our financial statements 
because of different requirements in the environmental laws of the us and canada  the complexity and uncertainty of existing and future requirements of environmental laws  permit conditions  costs of new and existing technology  potential preventive and remedial costs  insurance coverages and enforcement related activities and costs  we cannot determine at this time whether capital expenditures and other remedial actions that we may be required to undertake in the future will materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
with respect to known environmental contingencies  we have recorded provisions for estimated probable liabilities and do not believe that the ultimate resolution of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
management s discussion of cash flows the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our main sources and uses of cash 
these statements show the relationship between the operations presented in the consolidated statements of income and liquidity and financial resources depicted in the consolidated balance sheets 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of our capital expenditures  working capital needs  debt service obligations and dividends 
we usually meet our operating liquidity needs through internal generation of cash except in the event of significant acquisitions 
short term borrowings are generally used to fund seasonal operating requirements  particularly in the first two calendar quarters 
cash flows from operations the net cash provided by operations for each of the three years presented reflects our net income adjusted for non cash items 
the changes in working capital are discussed in management s discussion of financial position 
depreciation  depletion and amortization in remained at levels because increases from capital expenditures and acquisitions were offset by lower depreciation expense in our construction materials business 
in conformity with prior year practices  we continually evaluate our long lived assets and adjust the depreciable lives accordingly 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in from due to depreciation and depletion associated with various acquisitions and other capital projects completed in and the changes in working capital are discussed in management s discussion of financial position 
cash flows from investing capital expenditures increased in due largely to ongoing development projects such as the construction of the silver grove  kentucky and palatka  florida gypsum drywall plants and the sugar creek  missouri cement plant expansion 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million in excluding acquisitions 
we intend to invest in projects that maintain or improve the performance of our plants as well as in acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our competitive position in the us and canada 
in we expect to spend approximately million on slag production and grinding operations in chicago  million on the sugar creek  missouri cement plant  million on the optimization of our joppa  illinois cement plant and million on the completion of the palatka  florida gypsum drywall plant  which began operations in early spending on acquisitions increased million from due to the merger with the warren paving and materials group in late december and the acquisition of the presque isle quarry in june proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items totaled million in compared to million in capital expenditures increased in from due to various projects such as the construction of the silver grove  kentucky gypsum drywall plant and the richmond  british columbia and sugar creek  missouri cement plant expansions 
spending for acquisitions in fell below the prior year due to the acquisition of the seattle  washington cement plant  american flyash and the texada quarry in the prior year 
proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items  including the disposition of asphalt and paving operations in maryland  totaled million for and million for cash flows from financing in  net cash provided by financing increased million due to an increase in short term borrowings  partially offset by the repurchase of common stock see common equity interests in the notes to consolidated financial statements concerning the buyback program of common stock 
on june   we acquired a number of construction materials businesses from lafarge sa  our majority shareholder  for million in cash 
this use of cash is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a repayment of a million payable to lafarge sa  which was replaced in july with long term senior notes with a face value of million and proceeds  net of deferred losses on forward treasury lock and original issue discount  of million 
we have access to a wide variety of short term and long term financing alternatives in both the us and canada and have a syndicated  committed  five year revolving credit facility with nine participants totaling million 
at december  and  no amounts were outstanding under these credit facilities 
management s discussion of financial position the consolidated balance sheets summarize our financial position at december  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our canadian revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars  as well as interest rate risk inherent in our debt 
as more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we primarily use fixed rate debt instruments to reduce the risk of exposure to changes in interest rates and have used forward treasury lock agreements in the past to hedge interest rate changes on anticipated debt issuances 
the value reported for canadian dollar denominated net assets decreased from december  as a result of a decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
at december   the us dollar equivalent of a canadian dollar was versus at december  based on results  if the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar changed by percent  our consolidated net assets would change by approximately percent and net income would change by approximately percent 
liquidity is not materially impacted  however  since canadian earnings are considered to be permanently invested in canada 
working capital  excluding cash  short term investments  current portion of long term debt and the impact of exchange rate changes million  decreased million from december  to december  accounts receivable  excluding an exchange rate impact of million  decreased million primarily because during we entered into a receivables securitization program to provide us with an additional source of working capital and short term financing 
inventories increased million  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  due to lower levels of sales in the fourth quarter and the growth of the business 
the increase of million  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted mainly from our growth and the timing of purchases and payments 
income taxes payable decreased million  with no exchange rate impact  due to a decline in the effective rates  decreased levels of income and timing of payments 
net property  plant and equipment increased million during  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  primarily due to acquisitions  the expansion of the sugar creek  missouri cement plant  the construction of the palatka  florida and silver grove  kentucky drywall plants 
capital expenditures and acquisitions of fixed assets totaled million 
the excess of cost over net tangible assets of businesses acquired relates primarily to the redland  warren and presque isle transactions 
our capitalization is summarized in the following table december long term debt other long term liabilities and minority interests shareholders equity total capitalization the decrease in long term debt is discussed in management s discussion of cash flows 
the decrease in shareholders equity as a percentage of total capitalization is discussed in management s discussion of shareholders equity 
management s discussion of shareholders equity the consolidated statements of shareholders equity summarize the activity in each component of shareholders equity for the three years presented 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million and the issuance of a warrant for million 
these were partially offset by dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million  a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a percent decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and share repurchases of million 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million and a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a percent increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
these were partially offset by dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million

common equity interests include our par value per share common stock and the lafarge canada inc exchangeable preference shares  which are exchangeable into our common stock and have comparable voting  dividend and liquidation rights 
our common stock is traded on the new york and toronto stock exchanges under the ticker symbol laf and the exchangeable preference shares on the toronto stock exchange under the ticker symbol lcipre the following table reflects the range of high and low closing prices of common stock by quarter for and as quoted on the new york stock exchange quarters ended mar jun sep dec stock prices high low stock prices high low dividends are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december common equity dividends    less dividend reinvestments    net cash dividend payments    common equity dividends per share the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend per share to at our october board of directors meeting 
there have been no changes in the dividend rate since october management s discussion of selected consolidated financial data the selected consolidated financial data highlights certain significant trends in our financial condition and results of operations 
net sales in increased percent mainly due to increased product shipments  higher cement and ready mixed concrete prices and the first full year of operations of the gypsum drywall business 
in  net sales increased by percent primarily due to the addition of the redland operations as well as increased shipments and prices 
in  net sales increased by percent primarily due to favorable economic conditions supporting demand in most segments and increased average selling prices 
in  net sales increased by percent due to acquisitions throughout our operations and improving economic conditions  increased infrastructure spending and project work in canada  partially offset by poor weather conditions in the fourth quarter in our us operations and a percent decline in average selling prices of gypsum drywall 
see management s discussion of income for additional details 
inflation rates in recent years have not been a significant factor in our net sales or earnings growth  however  in we saw a rapid increase in fuel costs for our mobile fleet as well as in natural gas costs  most notably in our cement plant at exshaw  alberta and in our gypsum and asphalt operations 
we continually attempt to offset the effect of inflation by improving operating efficiencies  especially in the areas of selling and administrative expenses  productivity and energy costs  including  where possible  the use of alternative fuels for example  at our exshaw  alberta cement plant we have launched a project to enable the plant to burn coal instead of natural gas 
we compete with other suppliers of our products in all of our markets 
the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher prices for our products varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market 
net cash provided by operations consists of net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and changes in operating working capital 
we are in a capital intensive industry and  as a result  we recognize large amounts of depreciation 
we have used our cash provided by operations to expand our markets  improve the performance of our plants and other operating equipment  and for the years prior to the redland acquisition  to reduce debt 
during  we acquired redland for million 
since we acquired redland from our majority shareholder  we treated the acquisition similar to a pooling of interests 
consequently  redland s balance sheet was consolidated with our balance sheet at december  and redland s operating results were consolidated with ours for the full year capital expenditures and acquisitions  excluding redland  totaled  million over the past five years  which included the purchase of three gypsum drywall facilities and the construction of new drywall plants in kentucky and florida  acquisition of a cement plant and related limestone quarry  cement plant projects to increase production capacity and reduce costs including the new richmond  british columbia cement plant and the sugar creek  missouri cement plant currently under construction  the installation of receiving and handling facilities for substitute fuels and raw materials  the building and purchasing of additional distribution terminals and water transportation facilities to extend markets and improve existing supply networks  the expansion of our cementitious operations  the expansion of asphalt paving and aggregate operations through the merger with the warren paving and materials group in late december  the acquisition of ready mixed concrete plants and aggregate operations  including our acquisition of the presque isle quarry in june  and the renewal of the construction materials mobile equipment fleet
