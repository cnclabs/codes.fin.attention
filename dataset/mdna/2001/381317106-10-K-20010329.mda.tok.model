the gap table and related discussion included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  gives information on the repricing characteristics of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   and is incorporated herein by reference 
the dollar amounts of the company s income and interest expense fluctuate depending both on changes in the respective interest rates and on changes in the respective amounts volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

a the change in volume is calculated by multiplying the difference between the average balance of the current year and the prior year by the prior year s average yield 
the change in rate is calculated by multiplying the difference between the average yield of the current year and the prior year by the prior year s average balance 
the mixed changes in rate volume is calculated by multiplying the difference between the average balance of the current year and the prior year by the difference between the average yield of the current year and the prior year 
this amount is then allocated proportionately to the volume and rate changes calculated previously 
b the effects of interest rate swap activity has been included in income and expense of the related assets and liabilities 
c includes nonaccrual loans days or more past due 
competition and other matters the company experiences strong competition in both attracting deposits and making real estate loans 
competition for savings deposits has historically come from money market mutual funds  other savings institutions  commercial banks  and government and corporate debt securities 
in addition  traditional financial institutions have found themselves in competition with other financial services entities  such as securities dealers  insurance companies  credit unions  and others  including internet companies 
the principal methods used by the company to attract deposits  in addition to the interest rates and terms offered  include the offering of a variety of services and the convenience of office locations and hours of public operation 
competition in making real estate loans comes principally from other savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks 
many of the nation s largest savings institutions  mortgage banking companies  and commercial banks are headquartered or have a significant number of branch offices in the areas in which the company competes 
changes in the government s monetary  tax  or housing financing policies can also affect the ability of lenders to compete profitably 
the primary factors in competing for real estate loans are interest rates  loan fee charges  underwriting standards  and the quality of service to borrowers and their representatives 
in addition  the company competes indirectly with government sponsored enterprises  notably the federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and the federal home loan banks 
thrift industry the operations of the thrift industry are significantly influenced by general economic conditions  by the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and by the policies of financial institution regulatory authorities 
deposit flows and costs of funds are impacted by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending and other investment activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and for consumer and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
regulation federal home loan bank system 
the fhlb system functions in a reserve credit capacity for its members  which may include savings associations  savings banks  commercial banks  and credit unions 
as members  wsb and wtx are required to own capital stock of an fhlb in an amount that depends generally upon their outstanding home mortgage loans or advances from such fhlb  and are authorized to borrow funds from such fhlb see borrowings 
liquidity 
during   and  the office of thrift supervision required insured institutions  such as wsb and wtx  to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets in the form of cash and securities approved by federal regulations at either a of the quarterly average of daily balances of short term deposits and borrowings for the prior quarter or b of the prior quarter s ending balance of short term deposits and borrowings 
at december    and  wsb had liquidity in excess of the regulatory requirements 
wtx also met the applicable requirements during the periods under discussion 
in december  congress passed legislation which eliminated the statutory requirements for the ots to set minimum liquidity regulations 
federal deposit insurance corporation 
the fdic administers two separate deposit insurance funds  the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund 
each fund insures deposit accounts up to the maximum amount permitted by law  currently  per insured depositor 
the bif is a deposit insurance fund for commercial banks  federally chartered banks  and some state chartered banks 
the saif is a deposit insurance fund for most savings associations 
wsb is a member of the bif  but a portion of wsb s deposits are insured through the saif 
wtx s deposits are also insured by the fdic and wtx is a member of the bif 
as a result  wsb and wtx are subject to supervision  regulation  and examination by the fdic 
fdic insurance is required for all federally chartered financial institutions such as wsb and wtx 
such bif insurance may be terminated by the fdic under certain circumstances involving violations of regulations or unsound practices 
during  federal legislation was enacted to capitalize the saif in order to bring it into parity with the fdic s other insurance fund  the bif 
the new banking law required members to pay a levy of billion to bring the saif up to the required reserve level of of insured deposits  but lowered savings and loan deposit insurance premiums starting in as a result of this legislation  the company incurred a one time charge of million during the premiums paid for the years through were adjusted quarterly 
beginning on january   the premium paid by wsb and wtx to the fdic was 
per  the deposits of savings institutions insured by the saif may be converted to bif insurance 
further  deposits insured by the bif may be converted to saif insurance 
such conversions require payment of an exit fee to the insurance fund that the institution leaves and an entrance fee to the insurance fund that the institution enters 
office of thrift supervision 
because they are federally chartered savings institutions  the principal regulator of both wsb and wtx is the ots 
under various regulations of the ots  savings institutions are required  among other things  to pay assessments to the ots  maintain required regulatory capital  maintain liquid assets above specified minimums  and to comply with various limitations on loans to one borrower  equity investments  investments in real estate  and investments in corporate debt securities that are not investment grade 
federal reserve system 
federal reserve board regulations require savings institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their checking accounts 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements 
wsb and wtx are currently in compliance with all applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements 
savings institutions have authority to borrow from the federal reserve bank but the federal reserve board requires savings institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from the federal reserve bank 
regulatory capital 
the ots requires federally insured institutions such as wsb and wtx to meet certain minimum capital requirements 
the following table summarizes wsb s regulatory capital ratios and compares them to the ots minimum requirements at december the december  numbers are as reported to the ots and have not been restated because the ots did not require them to be restated to reflect the reorganization that took place in table world savings bank  a federal savings bank regulatory capital ratios dollars in thousands actual required actual required capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio capital ratio tangible     core     risk based     the following table summarizes wtx s regulatory capital ratio and compares them to the ots minimum requirements at december  table world savings bank  fsb texas regulatory capital ratios dollars in thousands actual required capital ratio capital ratio tangible   core   risk based   in addition  institutions whose exposure to interest rate risk as determined by the ots is deemed to be above normal may be required to hold additional risk based capital 
the ots has determined that wsb and wtx do not have above normal exposure to interest rate risk 
the ots has adopted rules based upon five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the determination of whether an institution falls into a certain classification depends primarily on its capital ratios 
as of december   the most recent notification from the ots categorized wsb well capitalized under the current requirements 
there are no conditions or events that have occurred since that notification that the company believes would have an impact on the categorization of wsb

see item  market for the registrant s common stock and related security holder matters on page  for a discussion on certain limitations imposed by the ots on dividends paid by savings institutions 
limitation on loans to one borrower 
current law subjects savings institutions to the same loans to one borrower restrictions that are applicable to national banks with limited provisions for exceptions 
in general  the national bank standard restricts loans to a single borrower to no more than of a bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  plus an additional if the loan is collateralized by certain readily marketable collateral 
real estate is not included in the definition of readily marketable collateral 
at december   the maximum that wsb could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million while the largest amount of loans it had to one borrower was million 
at december   the maximum amount that wtx could have loaned to one borrower and related entities was million while the largest amount of loans wtx had outstanding to any one borrower was thousand 
depositor priorities 
in the event of the appointment of a receiver of a federally chartered savings bank  such as wsb  based upon the failure of the savings bank to meet certain minimum capital requirements or the existence of certain other conditions  the federal deposit insurance act recognizes a priority in favor of holders of withdrawable deposits including the fdic subrogee or transferee over general creditors including holders of debt of wsb 
thus  in the event of a liquidation of wsb or a similar event  claims for deposits would have a priority over claims of holders of debt 
as of december   wsb had approximately billion of deposits outstanding 
powers of the fdic in connection with the insolvency of an insured depository institution 
if the fdic is appointed a receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution  such as wsb  the fdic may disaffirm or repudiate any contract or lease to which such institution is a party  the performance of which is determined to be burdensome  and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined to promote the orderly administration of the institution s affairs 
the fdic may contend that its power to repudiate contracts extends to obligations such as the debt of the depository institution  and at least one court has held that the fdic can repudiate publicly traded debt obligations 
the effect of any such repudiation should be to accelerate the maturity of debt 
such repudiation would result in a claim by each holder of debt against the receivership 
the claim may be for principal and interest accrued through the date of the appointment of the conservator or receiver 
alternatively  at least one court has held that the claim would be in the amount of the fair market value of the debt as of the date of the repudiation  which amount could be more or less than accrued principal and interest 
the amount paid on the claims of the holders of the debt would depend  among other factors  upon the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of unsecured claims and the priority of the claim relative to the claims of other unsecured creditors and depositors  and may be less than the amount owed to the holders of the debt 
see depositor priorities above 
if the maturity of the debt were so accelerated  and a claim relating to the debt paid by the receivership  the holders of the debt might not be able  depending upon economic conditions  to reinvest any amounts paid on the debt at a rate of interest comparable to that paid on the debt 
in addition  although the holders of the debt may have the right to accelerate the debt in the event of the appointment of a conservator or receiver of the depository institution  the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most types of contracts  including the debt pursuant to their terms  notwithstanding any such acceleration provision 
the fdic as conservator or receiver may also transfer to a new obligor any of the depository institution s assets and liabilities  without the approval or consent of its creditors 
in its resolutions of the problems of an insured depository institution in default or in danger of default  the fdic is generally obligated to satisfy its obligations to insured depositors at the least possible cost to the deposit insurance fund 
in addition  the fdic may not take any action that would have the effect of increasing the losses to the relevant deposit insurance fund by protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of deposits generally  or by protecting creditors other than depositors 
existing law authorizes the fdic to settle all uninsured and unsecured claims in the insolvency of an insured institution by making a final payment after the declaration of insolvency 
such a payment would constitute full payment and disposition of the fdic s obligations to claimants 
existing law provides that the rate of such final payment is to be a percentage reflecting the fdic s receivership recovery experience

during the fourth quarter of  world savings bank  ssb wssb  a wholly owned subsidiary of golden west  received approval to change from a texas state savings bank regulated by the fdic to a federally chartered savings bank regulated by the office of thrift supervision ots

on december   golden west contributed wtx to wsb and wtx became a wholly owned subsidiary of wsb 
in addition  on december   world savings and loan association  a wholly owned subsidiary of golden west  was merged into wsb 
the following narrative focuses on the significant financial statement changes that have taken place at golden west over the past three years and includes a discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
financial condition the following table summarizes the company s major asset  liability  and equity components in percentage terms at yearends    and as the table shows  the largest asset component is the loan portfolio including mortgage backed securities  which consists primarily of long term mortgages 
deposits represent the majority of the company s liabilities 
table asset  liability  and equity components as percentages of the total balance sheet december assets cash and investments loans receivable including mortgage backed securities other assets liabilities and stockholders equity deposits fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase medium term notes subordinated notes other liabilities stockholders equity asset liability management the company s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the amounts it receives from interest earned on loans  mbs  and investments and the amounts it pays in interest on deposits and borrowings 
therefore  the company s profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage interest rate risk and credit risk see asset quality section on page 
the company mitigates its credit risk through strict underwriting standards and loan reviews 
the company manages interest rate risk by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy 
such instruments are entered into solely to alter the repricing characteristics of designated assets and liabilities 
one measure of exposure to interest rate risk is the repricing gap  the difference between the repricing of assets and liabilities 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its assets and liabilities reprice at different times 
the disparity between the repricing maturity  prepayment  or interest rate change of mortgage loans and investments and the repricing of deposits and borrowings can have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the following table shows the company s repricing gap at december table repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  repricing gaps  and gap ratio as of december  dollars in millions projected repricing a over months months years years total interest earning assets investments mortgage backed securities   loans receivable rate sensitive    fixed rate  other b   impact of interest rate swaps total     interest bearing liabilities deposits c     fhlb advances    other borrowings  impact of interest rate swaps total     repricing gap      cumulative gap     cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets a based on scheduled maturity or scheduled repricing  loans and mbs reflect scheduled repayments and projected prepayments of principal based on current rates of prepayment 
b includes cash in banks and fhlb stock 
c liabilities with no maturity date  such as checking  passbook  and money market deposit accounts  are assigned zero months 
the gap table shows that  as of december   the company s assets reprice sooner than its liabilities 
if all repricing assets and liabilities responded equally to changes in the interest rate environment  then the gap analysis would suggest that golden west s earnings would rise when interest rates increase and would fall when interest rates decrease 
however  golden west s earnings are also affected by the built in reporting and repricing lags inherent in the eleventh district cost of funds index cofi  which is the benchmark the company uses to determine the rate on the majority of its adjustable rate mortgages arms 
the reporting lag occurs because of the time it takes to gather the data needed to compute the index 
as a result  the cofi in effect in any month actually reflects the eleventh district s cost of funds at the level it was two months prior 
the repricing lag occurs because cofi is based on a portfolio of accounts  not all of which reprice immediately 
therefore  cofi does not initially fully reflect a change in market interest rates 
consequently  when the interest rate environment changes  the cofi lags cause assets to initially reprice more slowly than liabilities  enhancing earnings when rates are falling and holding down income when rates rise 
additionally  the company originates loans that are tied to the golden west cost of savings index cosi 
the cosi in effect in any month reflects the actual golden west cost of savings at the level it was one month prior 
in addition to the index lags  other elements of arm loans also have an impact on earnings 
these elements are introductory fixed rates on new arm loans  the interest rate adjustment frequency of arm loans  interest rate caps or limits on individual rate changes  and interest rate floors 
partially offsetting the impact of the index lags are similar lags on a portion of the company s liabilities 
on balance  the index lags and arm structural features cause the company s assets initially to reprice more slowly than its liabilities  resulting in a temporary reduction in net interest income when rates increase and a temporary increase in net interest income when rates fall 
the table below reflects the company s expected cash flows and applicable yields on the balances of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of december   and takes into consideration expected prepayments of the company s long term assets primarily mortgage backed securities and loans receivable and the estimated current fair value

b deposits with no maturity are included in the column 
golden west estimates the sensitivity of the company s net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios to interest rate changes and anticipated growth based on simulations using an asset liability model which takes into account the lags previously described 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net earnings  and capital ratios based on interest rate increases or decreases that are sustained for a thirty six month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for certain assets  the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates  which are based on the company s historical prepayment information 
the model factors in projections for anticipated activity levels by product lines offered by the company 
based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   management believes that a basis point rate increase sustained over a thirty six month period would not adversely affect the company s long term profitability and financial strength 
cash and investments golden west s investment portfolio is composed primarily of federal funds  short term repurchase agreements collateralized by mortgage backed securities  short term money market securities  united states government obligations  collateralized mortgage obligations  and corporate bonds 
in determining the amounts of assets to invest in each class of investments  the company considers relative rates  liquidity  and credit quality 
the office of thrift supervision ots requires insured institutions  such as wsb  to maintain a minimum amount of cash and certain qualifying investments for liquidity purposes 
the current minimum requirement is to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets in the form of cash and securities approved by federal regulations at either of the quarterly average of daily balances of short term deposits and borrowings or of the prior quarter s ending balance of short term deposits and borrowings

during  the company securitized billion of adjustable rate mortgages into fnma mbs and securitized billion of mortgage loans into mbs remics 
the fnma mbs and the mbs remics are available to be used as collateral for borrowings 
the company has the ability and intent to hold these mbs until maturity and  accordingly  these mbs are classified as held to maturity

at december  and  the company had no trading mbs 
at december   billion of the company s total mbs portfolios were backed by arms 
the percentage of mbs backed by arms was at yearend compared to at yearend and at yearend the large amount of adjustable rate mbs is mainly due to the large amount of arm loans securitized in the last five years 
repayments of mbs during the years   and amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
mbs repayments were lower in due to a decrease in the prepayment rate 
mbs repayments were higher in due to an increase in total mbs outstanding 
loans new loan originations in   and amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the record high volume of originations during was due to a strong demand for adjustable rate loans  the company s primary product 
the increase in was due to renewed demand for adjustable rate loans as interest rates moved up and the cost of fixed rate loans increased 
in addition  the company increased the size of its loan origination staff to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
refinanced loans constituted of new loan originations in compared to in and in loans originated for sale were million  million  and billion for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the reduction in loans originated for sale in and in as compared to was attributable to the decrease in fixed rate originations

the company takes steps to minimize the potential credit risk with respect to loans with a loan to value ltv over 
among other things  the loan amount may not exceed of the appraised value of a single family residence 
also  some first mortgage loans with an ltv over carry mortgage insurance  which reimburses the company for losses up to a specified percentage per loan  thereby reducing the effective ltv to below 
furthermore  the company sells without recourse a significant portion of its second mortgage originations 
in addition  the company carries pool mortgage insurance on most seconds not sold  such that the cumulative losses covered by this pool mortgage insurance are limited to or of the original balance of the insured pool

as of december   million of arms had reached their rate floors 
the weighted average floor rate on the loans that had reached their floor was at december   compared to at december  without the floor  the average yield on these loans would have been at december  and at december  loan repayments consist of monthly loan amortization and loan payoffs 
during the years   and  loan repayments amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the decrease in repayments in was due to a decrease in loan payoffs and due to the securitization of loans into mbs 
the decrease in repayments in was due to a decrease in loan prepayments during the second half of the year and due to the securitization of loans into mbs 
mortgage servicing rights capitalized mortgage servicing rights are included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition

asset quality an important measure of the soundness of the company s loan and mbs portfolio is its ratio of nonperforming assets npas to total assets 
nonperforming assets include non accrual loans loans  including loans swapped into mbs with recourse and loans securitized into mbs remics  that are days or more past due and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
no interest is recognized on non accrual loans

other impaired loans amounted to million at yearend  million  and million at yearends and  respectively 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for losses on loans sold with recourse or securitized and retained the company provides specific valuation allowances for losses on loans when impaired and a write down on foreclosed real estate when any significant and permanent decline in value is identified 
the company also utilizes a methodology for monitoring and estimating loan losses that is based on both historical loss experience in the loan portfolio and factors reflecting current economic conditions 
this approach uses a data base that identifies losses on loans and foreclosed real estate from past years to the present  broken down by year of origination  type of loan  and geographical area 
based on these historical analyses  management is then able to estimate a range of general loss allowances by type of loan and risk category to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
one to four single family real estate loans are evaluated as a group 
in addition  periodic reviews are made of individual major multi family and commercial real estate loans and foreclosed real estate 
where indicated  specific and general valuation allowances are established or adjusted 
in estimating probable losses inherent in the portfolio  consideration is given to the estimated sales price  cost of refurbishing  payment of delinquent taxes  cost of disposal  and cost of holding the property 
additions to and reductions from the allowances are reflected in current earnings based upon quarterly reviews of the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance and reserves for loan losses 
the review methodology and historical analyses are updated at least annually as needed 
the table below shows the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the three years ended december    and table changes in allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands beginning allowance for loan losses    provision for recovery of losses charged to expense    transfer of allowance to reserve for losses on loans sold or securitized and retained   less loans charged off  add recoveries   ending allowance for loan losses    ratio of provision for recovery of loan losses to loan portfolio including mbs with recourse and mbs remics 


ratio of net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans outstanding including mbs with recourse and mbs remics 


as previously mentioned  the company has securitized loans from its portfolio into fnma mbs with recourse and mbs remics 
the company s intent is to hold these mbs and mbs remics to maturity 
because the loans underlying the mbs and mbs remics are similar to the loans in its loan portfolio  the company sets its reserve on these securities in a manner similar to the method it uses for the allowance for loan losses 
the company also sells loans with full credit recourse and has established a reserve for potential losses on these loans 
the liability for the reserve for losses on loans sold or securitized and retained is included in other liabilities

as previously indicated  the low level of nonperforming assets npas and troubled debt restructured tdrs over the past three years resulted from the strong economy and housing market 
the impact of the favorable environment is reflected in the components of the allowance account 
specific valuation allowances  primarily on large multi family and commercial real estate loans  decreased from million at december  to million at december  general loss reserves on large multi family and commercial real estate loans declined from million at december  to million at december  the general loss allowances on one to four single family real estate loans increased from million at december  to million at december  as a result of the increase in the total loan portfolio 
as a result of improved asset quality and rapid portfolio growth  the overall ratio of the allowance and recourse reserves to total loans and loans sold or securitized with recourse declined from 
at the end of to

the ots may disapprove a notice or deny an application  in whole or in part  if the ots finds that a the insured subsidiary would be undercapitalized or worse following the proposed capital distribution  b the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or c the proposed capital distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation  agreement with the ots  or a condition imposed upon the insured subsidiary in an ots approved application or notice 
in general  wsb may  with prior notice to the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year in an amount equal to that year s net income plus retained net income for the preceding two years  as long as immediately after such distributions it remains at least adequately capitalized 
capital distributions in excess of such amount  or which would cause wsb to no longer be adequately capitalized  require specific ots approval
