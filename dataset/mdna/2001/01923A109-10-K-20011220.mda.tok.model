item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a provider of a broad range of health care services and products with principal operations in the uk and the uk the company provides the following services and products i patient services  including nursing and para professional services  ii respiratory therapy and home medical equipment  and iii infusion therapy 
the company provides these services and products from the following two reportable business segments i uk operations and ii us home healthcare operations formerly hi tech 
the company s us operations supply nursing and para professional care to the community and uk healthcare institutions and medical grade oxygen to the uk pharmacy market and private patients in northern ireland 
the company s home healthcare operations are concentrated in new jersey and new york 
the company was a provider of specialty mail order pharmaceuticals and medical supplies 
on october   the company sold a substantial portion of the assets of its us mail order operations and subsequently closed this business segment 
in addition  on november   the company sold its uk subsidiary amcare 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company s uk subsidiaries obtained new financing 
concurrent with the refinancing  the company placed of its ownership interest in tw uk into a voting trust as further defined and described in liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of the provisions of the voting trust the company did not control a majority of the board of directors and the holders of the senior subordinated notes issued pursuant to the refinancing held substantive rights  principally in the form of their ability to approve the annual budget and financial forecast of results of operations and sources and uses of cash 
as a result of these rights  for accounting purposes the company was no longer able to consolidate the uk subsidiaries into its financial statements although it owned of the outstanding shares of the stock of the parent company  uk parent  as of december  therefore  effective with the refinancing  the company began accounting for the investment in uk parent and its subsidiaries under the equity method  retroactive to october  during the second quarter of fiscal  uk parent and tw uk amended their articles of association to give the chairman a company designee the right to resolve any tie votes of the board of directors and certain documents covering the notes as defined and described in liquidity and capital resources were amended to eliminate the requirement that the investors approve the operating budget 
these amendments have enabled the company to consolidate the uk subsidiaries as of january  the company s revenue mix and payor mix is influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles 
the following table shows the percentage of historical net revenues represented by each of the company s product lines year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  product line net patient services net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales net infusion services total revenues the increase in net patient services as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to growth in the company s uk flexible staffing business both organically and through the on going nursing and care agency acquisition program 
the decrease in net respiratory medical equipment and supplies sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is due primarily to the closing of the company s us mail order operations and the sale of amcare  in november on a pro forma basis  assuming the uk subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended september   the percentage of total revenues would have been as follows net patient services  net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales and net infusion services 
the following table shows the historical payor mix for the company s total revenues for the periods presented year ended year ended year ended september  september  september  payor uk nhs and other uk governmental payors medicare medicaid private payors total revenues the increase in nhs and other uk governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the uk acquisitions which derive the majority of their revenues from the nhs  and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business 
the decrease in medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the company exiting the us mail order operations 
the company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and to a lesser extent  from shifts in existing business among payors 
the increase in nhs and other uk governmental payors as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the acquisition of nightingale  which derives the majority of its revenues from the nhs  and to organic growth in the core flexible staffing business 
the decrease in medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  as compared to is primarily due to the decrease in revenue in the company s us mail order operations 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors in the us was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future 
the company maintains a diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or service 
the company s gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates 
the company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail order and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin 
at september  and  the company had  and  respectively of intangible assets primarily goodwill on its balance sheet 
this represented of total assets and of total stockholders equity at september  and of total assets and of total stockholders equity at september  amortization of intangibles for the years ended september   and was   and  respectively 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to increase the amount of intangible assets on the balance sheet 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the uk subsidiaries had been consolidated for the entire year ended september   amortization of intangibles would have been the company amortizes goodwill over periods ranging from ten to forty years based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized 
the company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given  among other factors  the continuing movement of patient care to non institutional settings  expanding demand due to demographic trends  the emphasis of the company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the consistent practice of other home health care companies 
at each balance sheet date  or if a significant adverse change occurs in the company s business  management assesses the carrying amount of enterprise goodwill 
the company measures impairment of goodwill by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows without interest to the carrying amount of goodwill 
this evaluation is done at the reportable business segment level primarily by subsidiary 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the future cash flows  the excess carrying amount of goodwill is written off 
the factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results  the effects of any current or proposed changes in third party reimbursement or other governmental regulations  trends and prospects of acquired businesses  as well as the effect of demand  competition  market and other economic factors 
if permanent impairment of goodwill were to be recognized in a future period  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
fas  business combinations  and statement no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of fas are effective for business combinations accounted for by the purchase method and completed after june  the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fas changes the accounting for business combinations by  among other things  prohibiting the prospective use of pooling of interests accounting 
under fas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
in accordance with the transitional provisions of fas  the company has not amortized goodwill acquired in business combinations subsequent to june  other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives
