the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in many cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend or continue  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this documents 
overview from inception through  we derived substantially all of our revenue from the development and marketing of networking products for apple macintosh computers 
these products enabled apple macintosh computers to connect to computer networks using ethernet communications standards 
the ethernet standard was developed in the s by xerox corporation and is the most widely used technology to facilitate communication between computers on local area networks 
the ethernet standard is defined by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and specifies the speed and other characteristics of a computer network 
in  we made a strategic business decision to concentrate our resources in the internet security market due to our belief that this market had better long term growth prospects 
as a result  we stopped shipments of our ethernet product line during december in october  we introduced our first internet security appliance  the sonicwall dmz  and began volume shipments in in  we began offering content filtering subscriptions to our sonicwall customers 
customers can purchase subscriptions for one to four years  and they receive weekly updated lists of objectionable web site addresses to which they can block access 
we now focus all our development  marketing and sales efforts on the internet security appliance market 
our shift to selling internet security products has not required any significant restructuring of our personnel  facilities  manufacturing or operations 
we have not experienced  and do not expect  any significant charges related to our ethernet product inventories or warranty obligations 
in  our internet security products represented approximately of our total revenue and in they represented of our total revenue 
in  our ethernet products represented of our total revenue and in  ethernet products are no longer being sold 
our sonicwall products are sold primarily through distributors who then resell our products to resellers and selected retail outlets 
these resellers then sell our products to end users 
two of our distributors  ingram micro  inc and tech data corp  both of which are global computer equipment and accessory distributors  account for approximately and of our revenue in and  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro  inc and tech data corp 
accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro  inc and tech data corp 
accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
our revenue consists of product sales and license and subscription revenue 
license and subscription fees include virtual private networking vpn  global management system  content filtering services  anti virus and extended warranty contract fees 
product sales comprised approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  product revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment if collectibility is probable and no significant obligations remain 
revenue from software products is recognized in accordance with sop specifically  revenue is generally recognized when delivery of the software has occurred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility of the fee is probable and the fee is fixed and determinable 
revenue from extended warranty programs  premium technical assistance  and subscriptions to content filtering and anti virus services is recognized ratably over the term of the contract or subscription 
ingram micro  inc s right to return or rotate its stock on hand is unlimited  and therefore we recognize revenue for product sales to ingram micro  inc when it has sold the product to its customers 
ingram micro  inc does not have the right to return non defective products to us if a customer of ingram micro  inc returns such a product to ingram micro  inc for all other distributors  the value of stock that can be rotated is generally limited to of the prior quarter s purchases 
co op advertising rights provide a distributor the right to be reimbursed up to of the prior quarter s sales for costs it has incurred associated with advertising our products 
for all of our distributors  we provide an allowance for sales returns  price protection rights and reserves for warranty and co op advertising costs at the time of revenue recognition 
price reductions which may result in price protection require the approval of our president  chief financial officer  and vice president of sales 
to date  a significant portion of our revenue has been dependent on large purchase orders from a limited number of distributors 
these purchase orders typically have short lead times and are subject to delay or cancellation without penalty 
we anticipate that our operating results for a given period will continue to depend on a small number of customers 
if we experience a decline in revenue from any of our significant distributors in a given quarter  our revenue for that quarter  or following quarters  will be adversely affected 
this could adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  if any of our significant customers experiences financial difficulties  our sales to these customers may be reduced  and we may have difficulty collecting accounts receivable from these customers 
any delay in large customer orders or customer financial difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we primarily use one contract manufacturer to manufacture our products 
we also rely on single or limited source suppliers to provide key components of our products 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue is related to these suppliers 
these relationships are subject to a variety of risks 
in august  we acquired all the partnership interest of ackfin networks  a california general partnership  in exchange for an aggregate of  shares of all common stock with an estimated value of per share  or  and the assumption of  in liabilities 
the controlling partners of ackfin  sreekanth ravi and sudhakar ravi  two of our executive officers and principal shareholders  were also the majority shareholders of sonicwall  inc and  therefore  were deemed to be a control group for purposes of determining the amount of purchase price to be stepped up 
the value of the exchanged shares for ackfin was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control 
accordingly  net assets acquired were valued by applying carryover basis to the control group interest and a stepped up basis to the minority interest 
the step up of the minority interest resulted in an intangible asset of  this intangible asset was attributed to acquired completed technology and will be amortized over a period of three years 
amortization expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the intangible assets acquired by the company were rights to the completed core technology developed by ackfin that provides the foundation for our internet products 
since this transaction occurred between entities that were under common control  the financial results of ackfin have been combined with our results for the period since the inception of ackfin  april  through the date of exchange  august expenses totaling  for the year ended december   were included in the accompanying statements of operations 
ackfin did not have any revenue transactions with unrelated third parties 
except for the expenses noted above  all other financial transactions for ackfin were eliminated upon combination with sonicwall  inc on october   the company announced its agreement to acquire phobos corporation phobos for million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
phobos designs  develops and sells scaleable internet traffic management itm solutions for internet service providers  application service providers  e commerce companies and web hosting and enterprise network operations centers 
under the terms of the merger  shares of the company s common stock were exchanged for each share of outstanding phobos common stock at november   the closing date of the merger 
in connection with the merger  the company issued  shares of its common stock  and options and warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock 
in addition  the company paid million in cash to the shareholders of phobos based upon their pro rata ownership percentage in phobos 
the merger agreement also provides for up to an additional million in cash to be payable upon achievement of certain future quarterly revenue targets during the quarterly amounts  representing additional purchase consideration  will be recorded when payable as adjustments to goodwill 
in  we recorded total deferred stock compensation of approximately  in connection with stock and stock options granted during at prices subsequently deemed to be below fair market value on the date of grant 
options granted are typically subject to a four year vesting period 
restricted stock acquired through the exercise of unvested stock options is subject to our right to repurchase the unvested stock at the price paid  which right lapses over a four year period 
we are amortizing the deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options and the repurchase periods for the restricted stock 
in  we recorded approximately million in additional deferred stock compensation for stock options granted in the year ended december   at prices subsequently deemed to be below fair market value on the date of grant 
we amortized approximately million of deferred stock compensation for the year ended december   including amortization for granted options to certain consultants in exchange for services rendered 
these options are subject to variable plan accounting with fair value re measurements at the end of each quarterly reporting period 
in  we recorded approximately million in additional deferred stock compensation  of which million related to the assumption of options in connection with the acquisition of phobos  and amortized approximately million of deferred stock compensation for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth financial data for the years indicated as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue product license and subscription total revenue cost of revenue product license and subscription total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development amortization of goodwill and intangibles deferred stock compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss compared to product revenue 
revenue from sales of our products increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a higher volume of products shipped  expansion of our distribution channel  expansion of our product offerings to include the sonicwall provx  sonicwall xprs  and sonicwall telecommuter  and increasing demand in our target markets 
the increase in shipping volume resulted primarily from increased market acceptance of the sonicwall products over the prior year 
we also increased shipments under an oem relationship that was entered in july and a new oem relationship entered in october in december  we stopped shipment of legacy ethernet products which contributed million in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  this decrease was directly related to our decision to focus on development  sales and marketing efforts on our internet security appliance products 
license and subscription revenue 
revenue from sales of our licenses and subscriptions increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase relates to increased sales of our vpn and content filtering products and the introduction of our anti virus subscription service in june there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will continue to increase in absolute dollars or at the rate at which they have grown in recent fiscal periods

gross margin increased to million  or of total revenue  in the year ended december  from million  or of total revenue  in the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of higher gross margin security appliance products and license subscription revenues  and the company s decision to cease shipping of the lower gross margin ethernet products in december in addition  we experienced increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead and component costs per unit due to economies of scale 
gross margin was also favorably impacted by growth in licenses and subscription revenues due to a larger installed base 
our gross margins are affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component costs and the mix of products sold 
factors contributing to the gross margin growth were partially offset by the effect of increased sales of oem products  which generate lower gross margins 
the company s gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products  new product introductions and enhancements and the cost of components and manufacturing labor 
we must manage each of these factors effectively for our gross margins to remain at current levels

these increases were primarily attributable to increased personnel costs  increased facility expenses related to the new leased facility entered in october  prototype expenses associated with the development of new products and ongoing support of current and future product development and enhancement efforts

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance to our products 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
as of the date of this offering  our sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be our then current cash balances  funds from operations and whatever long term credit facilities we can arrange 
we have no other agreements or arrangements with third parties to provide us with sources of liquidity and capital resources beyond twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as stated in our investment policy  we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates changes prior to maturity 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
we invoice all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and all revenue is collected in us dollars 
in addition  we do not have any cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  we do not have significant market risks associated with foreign currencies or related to sales and collections
