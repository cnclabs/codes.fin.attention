item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview blue rhino was founded in march and has become the leading national provider of propane grill cylinder exchange as well as a leading provider of complimentary propane and non propane products to consumers  with blue rhino cylinder displays at more than  retail locations in states and puerto rico 
cylinder exchange provides consumers with a convenient means to exchange empty grill cylinders for clean  safe  precision filled cylinders 
we offer cylinder exchange at many major home improvement centers  mass merchants  hardware  grocery and convenience stores  including home depot  lowe s  wal mart  sears  kmart  kroger  food lion  winn dixie  superamerica  circle k and exxonmobil 
during fiscal  our net revenues increased approximately to approximately million from the prior fiscal year due primarily to growth in product sales and cylinder exchange transactions at existing locations and an increase in the prices charged to retailers 
the number of retail locations we report in any period is net of any retail locations at which we have discontinued our cylinder exchange service  whether due to closings  relocations  performance  competitive  regulatory or other factors 
we partner with retailers and independent distributors to provide consumers with a nationally branded alternative to traditional grill cylinder refill 
we dedicate our efforts and capital to brand development  value added marketing  customer service  cylinders  displays  account growth  distributor network development and management information systems 
our independent distributors invest in the vehicles and other operational infrastructure necessary to operate cylinder exchange businesses 
we believe that our distributor network affords us the opportunity to service approximately of the cylinder exchange markets in the united states 
we currently offer three types of grill cylinder transactions i like for like cylinder exchanges  ii cylinder exchanges with valve upgrades offering additional safety features  and iii filled cylinder sales 
cylinder transactions accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal our products segment revenue grew dramatically in fiscal to million from million in fiscal primarily due to an additional eight months sales by uniflame during fiscal  as uniflame was acquired in april  and growth in uniflame s sales 
uniflame s revenues are derived from products that use propane cylinders as their fuel source  principally patio heaters and grills  and non propane products such as charcoal grills  fireplace accessories and garden products 
the majority of uniflame s sales occur in the fall and winter months  which is counterseasonal to our cylinder exchange segment 
quickship  inc  a retail shipping services company acquired in october  is included within the products segment as it is not currently material on a stand alone basis note 
our revenues are influenced by a number of factors  including seasonality  consumer awareness  weather conditions  new propane appliance sales  promotional activities  advertising and those factors described above under business additional factors that may affect our business and future results 
we strategically expanded our business in the past two years to diversify our revenue stream  balance our seasonality and offer and promote more products that use our core grill cylinder exchange service 
our acquisitions of uniflame and international propane products  llc have allowed us to expand our offerings to include an array of products including barbecue grills and patio heaters 
in these acquisitions  we also acquired proprietary designs  patents and human capital to complement our expertise in marketing  sales  and coordination with manufacturers and distributors 
our products division is separately managed by uniflame s management team  which has extensive experience in the design and import of consumer products sold through mass retailers 
our cost of sales for cylinder exchange is comprised of a contractually determined fixed base amount  along with a variable component based on the price of propane  that we pay to our distributors for each cylinder transaction 
our cost of sales for products is comprised of the wholesale cost of products sold 
we incurred significantly higher costs for cylinder exchange in fiscal and fiscal  due to wholesale propane prices reaching a year high while having fixed price agreements with major retail customers 
between march and february  we made voluntary payments of million to our distributors to help offset the impact on our distributors of the significantly higher propane prices  to protect our large retail customers from supply disruptions  and to ensure continued strong distributor and customer relationships 
on march   we changed the method in which we pay our distributors and implemented a propane hedging strategy 
these measures  combined with price increases to retailers  began to favorably impact cylinder exchange gross margins during the third quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  gross margins on cylinder transactions returned to historical levels in excess of 
while we believe that we have created the infrastructure necessary to support a nationwide branded products and service company  development of this infrastructure has resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of july  this has resulted in net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that are available to offset future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts from through however  the utilization of the net operating losses will be subject to certain limitations as prescribed by section of the internal revenue code 
based on our history of operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance to the full extent of our net deferred tax assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of operations to net revenues 
due to many factors  including the national fire protection association nfpa requirement that all propane cylinders refilled after april  be fitted with an overfill prevention device  the diversification of our product offerings and our rapid sales growth  any trends reflected by the following table may not be indicative of future results 
net revenues operating costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating costs and expenses income from operations interest and other expense income interest expense other  net income loss before other non operating expenses other non operating expenses loss on investees nonrecurring items income loss before income taxes and extraordinary loss income taxes income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss  net net income loss preferred dividends net income loss available to common stockholders comparison of years ended july  and net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net revenues for fiscal consisted of million from cylinder transactions and million from product sales 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to a four fold increase in product sales reflecting an additional eight months of sales by uniflame this fiscal year  as uniflame was acquired in april cylinder revenues increased primarily due to an approximately increase in same store sales  the maturity and increased consumer awareness of cylinder exchange locations selling less than one year and an increase in the prices charged to retailers 
the number of cylinder transactions increased to approximately million units during fiscal from approximately million units during fiscal we currently expect the trend of growth in cylinder transactions to continue as consumers switch from refill to exchange  particularly as a result of the national fire protection association nfpa requirement that all propane cylinders refilled after april  be fitted with an overfill prevention device  and as propane fueled products like the patio heaters that we offer gain acceptance in the marketplace 
gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the increase in product sales as a percentage of net revenues 
product sales carry a lower gross margin than do cylinder transactions 
gross margin was also negatively affected in fiscal by increased payments to distributors that we made voluntarily from march through february to help offset an increase in wholesale propane prices 
on march   we changed the method in which we pay our distributors and implemented a propane hedging strategy 
these measures  combined with price increases to retailers  began to favorably impact cylinder exchange gross margins during the third quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  gross margins on cylinder transactions returned to historical levels in excess of 
for fiscal  we currently expect cylinder exchange margins to continue to be at least and product sales gross margins to continue to be between and 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to overhead costs resulting from the uniflame and quickship acquisitions being included in operations in fiscal and to increased marketing and administrative costs to support the growth in the cylinder exchange business 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the fact that a significant portion of such expenses are fixed and increased at a slower rate than did net revenues 
we currently expect selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal to continue to decrease as a percentage of net revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal depreciation expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the increase in the number of installed cylinder displays and the increase in the number of cylinders held under operating lease agreements 
the increase in cylinders and cylinder displays was necessary to support the growth in our installed base of retail locations 
amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal amortization increased principally due to the amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the additional borrowings outstanding under our credit facility combined with an increase in interest rates on the credit facility and interest expense on subordinated debt and related warrants 
the additional borrowings were used primarily to fund operations  to purchase cylinders and cylinder displays leased to our distributors and to fund business acquisitions and our investment in and advances to r technical center north carolina  llc r tech  the automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant 
other  net 
other  net increased to income of approximately  for fiscal from a loss of approximately  for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of additional interest income from advances to r tech and distributors 
loss on investee 
loss on investee increased to million for fiscal from  for fiscal this charge represents our share of the loss related to our ownership interest in r tech  which began operations in april we expect this venture to continue to experience losses  which we believe are typical in a start up manufacturing operation  until volumes increase and revenue from converting cylinders without an overfill prevention device opd into opd cylinders is realized  which we believe will occur in the grilling season 
we cannot  however  predict with certainty when this will occur  if ever 
r tech is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income loss 
we expect r tech s revenues to be the highest in our third and fourth quarters  which include the majority of the grilling season  and lowest in our first and second quarters 
nonrecurring items 
there was a nonrecurring loss of approximately  in fiscal from costs incurred in connection with refinancing our bank credit facility 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to  in fiscal from  for fiscal  which reflects current state income tax expense 
extraordinary loss 
the extraordinary loss of  in fiscal consisted of the unamortized debt discount and other debt issuance costs that were recognized due to the early retirement of convertible notes in july comparison of years ended july  and net revenues 
net revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal net revenues for fiscal consisted of approximately million from cylinder transactions and million from product sales 
product sales consisted of patio heaters  fireplace accessories  barbecue grills and garden products 
the increase in net revenues was due primarily to an approximately increase in same store cylinder transaction sales  growth in cylinder exchange locations  product sales related to the acquisition of uniflame in april and growth in the sales of patio heaters to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the number of cylinder transactions increased to approximately million units during fiscal from approximately million units during fiscal gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased payments to distributors that we made voluntarily beginning in march to help offset the increase in wholesale propane prices and to an increase in lower margin product sales as a percentage of net revenues  which were partially offset by an increase in lease income 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased overhead costs resulting from the acquisition of uniflame  which contributed approximately million of the increase  as well as increased advertising and promotional expenses and additional compensation and related costs from the growth of our sales  administrative and dealer personnel 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal depreciation expense increased by million to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal primarily due to the increase in the number of cylinder displays and the commencement of depreciation on cylinders held under operating lease agreements 
the increase in cylinders and cylinder displays was due to growth in our installed base of retail locations 
our purchase of computer technology also impacted depreciation expense to a lesser extent 
amortization expense increased by  to approximately million in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal  principally due to the increased amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately  for fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from increased borrowings under our credit facility related to acquisitions and capital investments related to growth in the number of cylinder exchange locations 
other  net 
other  net decreased to an expense of approximately  for fiscal from income of approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest income resulting from lower excess cash and notes receivable balances 
loss on investees 
loss on investees increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this item reflects distinct investees for each year 
fiscal reflects our share of losses related to our investment in r tech  the automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant  which opened in may the loss incurred in fiscal is related to the application of the equity method of accounting to our convertible loan to bison valve  llc 
we recorded these losses as bison valve used the proceeds of our loan to fund losses incurred primarily in researching  developing  marketing and producing an opd and other propane related products 
as of october   we had recognized charges for the entire principal balance of our convertible loan 
in september  we purchased from bison valve the intellectual property  inventory and certain other assets related to its underwriters laboratories approved opd 
nonrecurring items 
for fiscal  we incurred a one time charge of  for expenses incurred in connection with an offering of common stock that we terminated before completion in february due to unfavorable market conditions 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased slightly to approximately  for fiscal  which reflects current state income tax expense 
extraordinary loss 
the extraordinary loss of  in fiscal consisted of the unamortized debt discount and other debt issuance costs that were recognized due to the early retirement of convertible notes in july liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds have been the incurrence of debt  the issuance of stock and cash flow from operations 
we had working capital of approximately million as of july   which was primarily the result of cash provided by the issuance of stock and debt and  to a lesser extent  cash provided by operations 
net cash generated by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
cash provided by operations in all periods was due primarily to the add back of non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization and loss on investee 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the primary components of cash used in investing activities in all periods included acquisitions  purchases of cylinders leased to our distributors  and investments in property  plant and equipment 
for fiscal  cash used in investing activities also included advances to r tech 
for fiscal  cash used in investing activities included our net investment in and advances to r tech 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the primary components of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal included the net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and subordinated debt 
in fiscal and  the primary components of cash provided by financing activities included proceeds from issuance of common stock and proceeds from notes payable to our lender 
the cash used in financing activities in all periods included payments on various loans  notes payable and capital lease obligations 
on april   we entered into a joint venture agreement to operate and manage r tech  which began operations in april we received a ownership interest in the joint venture in exchange for our net contribution of approximately million 
the joint venture is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
during fiscal  we advanced million to r tech 
at july   we had cumulative advances outstanding of approximately million to r tech 
we expect r tech to repay these advances by transferring to blue rhino ownership of the propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant in north carolina in october we currently anticipate providing additional advances to r tech in the future 
on september   we completed a private placement of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock to two institutional investors under common management and three individuals  including billy d 
prim  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  and andrew j 
filipowski  our vice chairman  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
messrs 
prim and filipowski invested  and  for  and  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  respectively 
we used the aggregate net proceeds of approximately million from our preferred stock private placement to repay million of our term debt  and the balance was used for general working capital 
in connection with this issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock we paid william blair co 
a placement fee of  in cash and have issued a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the series a convertible preferred stock accrues a cumulative dividend on the th day of december  march  june  and september of each year based on an annual rate of through september   from september  through september   and thereafter 
at our election  the dividend may be paid in cash  in shares of common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock at any time prior to conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock and must be paid at conversion 
if we elect to pay the dividend in shares of common stock  the shares will be valued based on a day trailing average ending three business days prior to the date the shares are authorized to be issued 
as of july   we had accrued dividends on the outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock of  each share of series a convertible preferred stock is convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at any time after september  if the market price of the common stock exceeds a prescribed threshold  we may convert the series a convertible preferred stock into common stock at any time after september  each share of series a convertible preferred stock is convertible into one share of common stock  subject to adjustment for subdivisions  combinations  stock dividends  reclassifications and other similar transactions and certain stock issuances below the then existing conversion price 
the series a convertible preferred stock has a liquidation preference over our common stock 
the holders of the shares of series a convertible preferred stock have certain registration rights 
on october   we completed the acquisition of quickship  inc  a retail shipping service company previously based in lenexa  kansas 
quickship  our wholly owned subsidiary  provides consumers with a convenient  full service  in store postal and parcel shipping depot and provides retailers with an additional revenue source 
the aggregate purchase price  including certain acquisition costs  was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash and deferred payments   in a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  million in liabilities assumed and million paid in the form of shares of series a convertible preferred stock valued at per share 
in june  we amended and extended our existing bank credit facility the credit facility 
the amended credit facility consists of two separate facilities a million revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes  inclusive of payments made under letters of credit issued for the benefit of the company  and a million seasonal line for general corporate purposes 
no further borrowings may be made against the seasonal line 
the credit facility requires us to meet certain covenants  including minimum net worth and cash flow requirements 
the credit facility is collateralized by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
the credit facility bears interest at the prime rate plus per annum 
in the event that the total borrowings under the credit facility exceed million as of december   the rate will be the prime rate plus per annum thereafter 
the credit facility matures on december  at july  the interest rate on both the revolving line of credit and seasonal line was 
at july   the balance on the credit facility was million 
in conjunction with the credit facility  we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million as a partial hedge of our variable interest rate debt 
the purpose of the swap is to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
under the swap agreement  which expires in july  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a rate equivalent to the one month london interbank offered rate libor 
on june   we completed a million private placement of subordinated debt to an institutional investor 
the agreement requires us to meet certain cash flow and other covenants and contains restrictions on capital expenditures and the payment of cash dividends 
the debenture bears interest at the annual rate of  payable quarterly 
the principal balance matures on august  in addition  we issued a warrant to the investor to purchase  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of per share subject to adjustment for organic changes and for certain future issuances below the then existing exercise price 
the warrant can be exercised at the holder s discretion in whole or in part any time until the later of june  or five years after payment of all amounts due under the debenture 
we anticipate that our total capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding acquisitions  will be approximately million  and will relate primarily to cylinders  cylinder displays and computer technology 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will change depending on the rate of our expansion  our operating results and any other adjustments in our operating plan needed in response to competition  acquisition opportunities or unexpected events 
we believe that our existing borrowing capacity under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through fiscal however  there can be no assurance that we will not seek or require additional capital in the future as a result of expansion or otherwise  or that such additional capital will be available on terms that are not dilutive to our stockholders 
seasonality we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and net income loss 
historically  our revenues have been highest in our third and fourth quarters  which include the majority of the grilling season  and lowest in our first and second quarters  which include the winter months 
our acquisition of uniflame has resulted in increased revenues for our first quarter  which includes the months in which uniflame historically has shipped the majority of its products to retailers 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the spring and summer seasons  would negatively impact our revenues 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our revenues  cost of sales or our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
price of propane during the fiscal year ended july   there were dramatic increases in fuel costs and propane reached unusually high levels 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  propane prices returned to a range more consistent with historical levels 
on march   we initiated a propane price hedging strategy that we believe will reduce our gross margin risk resulting from fluctuations in the price of propane 
our strategy is designed to reduce exposure to the fuel cost component of a significant portion of our total cylinder exchange volume 
if propane costs rise for an extended period and our hedging strategy is unsuccessful  our gross margins and results of operations could be negatively affected due to additional costs that may not be fully recovered through an increase in our price to our customers 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year as of july   we have unamortized intangibles of million that will be subject to the transition provisions of the statements 
we have not yet determined the impact of adopting these statements on our earnings and financial position  including whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million in fiscal in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of statement no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest based on the prime rate and is collateralized by cylinders held under operating leases with our independent distributors 
the operating leases currently yield of the cylinder value monthly approximately annually and continue until either party terminates upon days written notice to the other party 
upon any significant increase in the prime rate  we would attempt to renegotiate the operating leases with our independent distributors with the intent of mitigating our interest rate exposure on the credit facility 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in such renegotiations or that we would be able to mitigate any or all of the interest rate risk 
to quantify our exposure to interest rate risk  a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended july  and by approximately  and  respectively 
actual changes in interest rates may differ materially from the hypothetical assumptions used in computing this exposure 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our credit facility 
these derivative financial instruments  which are generally swap agreements  are not entered into for trading purposes 
a swap agreement is a contract to exchange a floating rate for a fixed rate without the exchange of the underlying notional amount 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million as a hedge of our variable interest rate debt represented by the credit facility 
under the swap agreement  which expires in july  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a rate equivalent to the one month libor 
in february  the interest rate on the credit facility was changed to a rate based on the prime rate and is no longer based on the benchmark interest rate of libor 
however  for the three month period ending july   the interest rate swap was still an effective cash flow hedge 
we are exposed to commodity price risk related to changes in the price of propane 
if propane prices rise for an extended period  our gross margins and results of operations could be negatively affected due to additional costs that may not be fully recovered through an increase in our price to our customers 
assuming that propane prices are not hedged and any increase cannot be recovered through an increase in our price  a 
increase in the price per gallon of propane would reduce the gross margin in our cylinder exchange segment by approximately 
or basis points 
actual changes in margins may differ materially from the hypothetical assumptions used in computing this exposure 
we have restructured our payment obligations to distributors and entered into a series of monthly option contracts that are designed to reduce exposure to the propane cost component of a significant portion of our total cylinder exchange volume 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of money market instruments  bank certificates of deposit and overnight investments in commercial paper 
all of our transactions are conducted and accounts are denominated in us dollars and as such we do not currently have exposure to foreign currency risk
