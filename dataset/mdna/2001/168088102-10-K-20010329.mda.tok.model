results of operations the long running economic expansion that the us economy has enjoyed appears to have run its course 
though there may be some debate as to the extent of the slowdown in the overall economy  there is little doubt that the manufacturing sector slowed dramatically during despite record automobile sales  companies operating within that segment of the economy generally posted weaker results than in the prior year 
this was the case for chicago rivet 
the softness in new orders that we reported early in continued to characterize our markets throughout the year  and the softening accelerated during the second half 
in view of these conditions  which contributed to both lower revenues and reduced income compared to the record performance in  our results for the year were respectable 
compared to conditions in our major markets tended to weaken as the year progressed 
as a result  net sales and lease revenues declined to  in on an overall basis  this represents a decline of compared to the record level of  recorded in revenues within the fastener segment  which began at a slightly stronger pace than in the prior year  ended the year at  a decline of compared to  as the second half of the year was characterized by business levels that were sharply lower than the preceding six months 
this downturn is attributable to a decline in the level of activity within the motor vehicle and automotive parts sector of the economy upon which we depend for the majority of our fastener revenues 
within the assembly equipment segment  demand was comparatively soft early in the year  and became weaker as the year progressed 
as a result  revenues for the full year declined approximately compared to  totaling  during given the reduced operating levels  gross margins within the fastener segment declined compared to the prior year 
however  there were other significant factors that impacted gross margins 
among them were increases in wage levels necessary to retain skilled labor in the face of very tight labor markets  increases in the cost of tooling and supplies used in manufacturing  significantly higher costs for health insurance and higher depreciation expense associated with recent investments in new manufacturing equipment 
while competitive situations continued to hamper our ability to recover the higher costs outlined above  favorable conditions in the market for raw materials enabled us to negotiate modest reductions in the prices paid for certain raw materials 
overall  however  the combination of lower volume and generally higher manufacturing costs caused gross margins within the fastener segment to fall to compared to in the prior year 
during  revenues within the assembly equipment segment declined approximately compared to most of this decline was a function of reduced unit sales  as demand was comparatively weak throughout the year 
gross margins declined from approximately in to in  due in part to a continued shift toward lower priced and lower margin equipment  and also reflects the impact of higher health insurance costs 
most other costs of manufacturing were reduced to levels consistent with the lower operating levels 
selling and administrative expenses declined compared with costs incurred in connection with the implementation of new data processing systems declined substantially compared with  but still remained at higher than normal levels for most of the current year 
both commission expense and profit sharing expense declined in proportion with the decline in sales and profits  respectively 
offsetting these changes were professional fees incurred in connection with the company s dutch auction tender offer  higher health insurance costs  and increases in salary expense 
interest expense increased approximately  due primarily to additional borrowing in connection with the tender offer and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
during interim periods  the company uses estimated gross profit rates to determine the cost of goods sold for a portion of its operations 
actual results can vary from these estimates and these estimates are adjusted  as necessary  when actual information is available 
during the fourth quarter of  net income included net favorable adjustments to inventory  accruals and allowances aggregating 
per share 
similar adjustments in the fourth quarter of and amounted to 
per share and 
per share  respectively 
compared to the company s net sales and lease revenues increased approximately  totaling  in  compared with  recorded in revenues within the fastener segment improved  reflecting the strength of the automotive industry  which represents the company s largest market 
while revenue from sales within the assembly equipment segment improved  lease revenues in that segment declined compared to the prior year  which resulted in a net increase in sales and lease revenues within the assembly equipment segment of 
overall  gross margins improved to  an increase of approximately  despite a charge of  associated with a product recall 
selling and administrative expenses increased significantly  primarily due to expenditures for information technology  and net income increased to  the fastener segment produced the most dramatic changes compared with revenues within this segment increased to  this increase was largely a reflection of very strong growth in the economy in general and record levels of production within the automotive industry 
the increased volume levels contributed to generally higher margins as fixed costs  with the exception of depreciation  remained relatively constant compared with the strength of the employment market contributed to increases in wage levels that slightly exceeded the overall inflation level  and the limited availability of skilled labor necessitated an increase in overtime expense in order to meet increased demand within this segment of our operations 
despite the strong market conditions prevalent throughout the year  our markets remained extremely price competitive  and our ability to obtain price relief continued to be limited 
fortunately  efforts to control manufacturing costs in other areas continued to be successful  and the company also benefited from negotiated reductions in the costs of certain raw materials 
while the fundamental performance within this segment of our business was very successful  that success was tarnished by a charge incurred in connection with a recall of vehicles that contained certain non conforming parts which were manufactured by the company 
as previously reported  a settlement was successfully negotiated  but total costs incurred in connection with this incident amounted to  before taxes  of which  was charged to cost of goods sold  offsetting a portion of the positive improvements recognized in operations 
revenues within the assembly equipment segment  as a whole  also improved compared with however  competitive conditions caused the company to occasionally accept margins below those that were enjoyed in the past  and  as a result  the increase in revenues was slightly biased toward products with lower margins 
in addition  increases in costs of raw materials and other manufacturing expenses nearly offset the increase in revenues 
as a result  the margin increase within this segment was minimal 
selling and administrative expenses increased approximately compared to the prior year 
costs incurred in connection with implementation of new data processing systems  including efforts related to mitigating the impact of any potential yk issues  amounted to nearly  during the year and represent the primary factor contributing to the increased level of selling and administrative expense 
increases in data communications expense and depreciation related to the new information system added an additional  to administrative expenses and profit sharing expense increased by  bad debt expense was reduced by  and travel expense declined by  increases in salary expense were partially offset by a reduction in commission expense as a larger percentage of sales was handled by company employees 
interest expense during decreased approximately  compared with as the effect of higher interest rates was offset by a lower outstanding balance on the loan 
interest income was approximately  lower than that recorded in the prior year due to a reduction in the level of funds available for investment in interest bearing accounts 
dividends the company paid four regular quarterly dividends of 
per share during in addition  an extra dividend of 
per share was paid during the second quarter of  bringing the total dividend payout to per share 
on february  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 
per share  payable march  to shareholders of record march  these dividends continued the uninterrupted record of consecutive quarterly dividends paid by the company to its shareholders that extends over years 
at that same meeting  the board declared an extra dividend of 
per share  payable april  to shareholders of record  april  machinery and equipment capital investments totaled approximately million during slightly over million of this total was invested in new equipment related to the production of fasteners 
of the amount expended within the fastener segment  million was invested in new cold heading and thread forming equipment and certain support equipment 
this equipment will be utilized to expand our capacity to manufacture certain specialty products for which demand has exceeded our capacity 
certain obsolete heat treating equipment was replaced at a cost of  the balance was expended for various smaller projects  including new quality control equipment and building improvements 
within the assembly equipment segment  capital expenditures totaled  primarily for the replacement of machine tools used in the manufacture of perishable tooling that is sold to our customers 
the balance was expended for data processing equipment and various office equipment 
investments in machinery and equipment totaled  during investments in new equipment related to the manufacture of fasteners accounted for the majority of these investments and amounted to  during the year 
investments in hardware and software related to improved information management technology totaled  a total of  was expended for the purchase of a variety of test and inspection equipment related to quality control initiatives 
investments in new machine tools used in the manufacture of assembly equipment totaled  approximately  was invested in new telephone equipment and the balance was expended for the purchase  or repair  of various  smaller machine tools and building repairs 
the company made a number of significant investments in both equipment and building improvements during capital expenditures totaled nearly  expenditures related to new data processing systems  including computer hardware and software  amounted to approximately  expenditures for the purchase of new equipment used in the manufacture of fasteners amounted to  the company also purchased a variety of new machine tools  material handling equipment and inspection equipment valued at approximately  building improvements  which included the installation of new air compressors at one facility and a new roof at another facility  amounted to approximately  investment in both new equipment and rebuilding of existing equipment used to plate and heat treat fasteners amounted to  a total of  was expended for the construction of new automatic rivet setting equipment that is leased to customers 
the balance was expended for a variety of smaller office equipment and for the construction of new rivet setting machines that will be used for demonstration purposes 
depreciation expense amounted to  in   in and  in liquidity and capital resources working capital at year end amounted to million 
although this is a slight decline from the prior year end  the change is not unexpected given the significant expenditures for new equipment made during the year 
the decline in accounts receivable balance at year end reflects the fact that sales during the latter portion of were substantially lower than during the same period in the prior year 
this sudden change in demand resulted in an opposite change in inventory levels  which increased  compared to the end of production activity has been adjusted to compensate for the lower sales activity  and we expect that inventories will be reduced to a level consistent with current sales 
in connection with a dutch auction tender offer in april  the company obtained  on an unsecured basis  a financing commitment that provided borrowing capacity of up to million plus a million line of credit 
the new borrowing was used to finance the unpaid balance of a loan related to the acquisition of h l tool company  inc million and to fund the purchase of stock under the terms of the dutch auction 
at year end  the indebtedness under the term loan was approximately million 
under the terms of the note  the company is scheduled to repay the principal in quarterly installments of  plus interest computed on the unpaid balance at a variable rate that is calculated under one of two methods  selected at the option of the company the london inter bank offering rate libor plus an applicable margin  or the lender s prime rate  less an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based upon the funded debt ratio and  for any portion of the loan that bears interest at the prime rate  this margin is up to basis points  and for any portion that bears interest at the libor rate  it is up to basis points 
this rate is adjusted quarterly 
at year end  the rate was approximately 
management believes that current cash  cash equivalents and the available line of credit will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
new accounting standards the company s financial statements and financial condition were not  and are not expected to be  materially impacted by any new  or proposed  accounting standards 
stock purchase program terms of a stock repurchase authorization originally approved by the board of directors in february of  and subsequently amended to permit the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares  provide for purchases of the company s common stock to be made from time to time  in the open market or in private transactions  at prices deemed reasonable by management 
purchases under the current repurchase authorization have amounted to  shares at an average price of per share 
this includes the purchase of  shares during at an average price of per share 
it is management s intention to continue this program  provided market conditions are favorable and funding for repurchases is available 
in addition to the purchases described above  the company purchased  shares at a price of per share pursuant to a dutch auction tender offer completed in april funding for the purchases was provided through additional borrowing described above 
year compliance we are pleased to report that no significant yk disruptions were incurred by the company 
outlook for as this is written  the economic outlook for the balance of is uncertain 
while experts continue to debate whether the economy is headed for a recession  there is mounting evidence that the so called old economy has been in recession for the past several months 
certainly  we have seen demand in our markets soften dramatically over that time period 
while in many years our first quarter is often our strongest quarter  bookings for the first quarter of are well below the levels that we would consider satisfactory 
anecdotal evidence suggests that our situation is far from unique especially in the segment of the economy in which we operate 
while we anticipate that conditions will improve  when that improvement will be manifested is uncertain  and depends in large measure upon factors over which we have little or no control 
in the interim  we have taken appropriate actions to adjust operating levels to match the reduced level of demand that is prevalent in our markets 
spending will be closely controlled  and every opportunity to reduce costs will be evaluated 
during  we began a program to expand our capacity in certain products where demand outpaced our capacity 
we anticipate that program  which should be completed in the second quarter of  will have a positive impact on both revenues and profits 
however  the timing and magnitude of its contribution to revenues and profits will depend  in part  upon a recovery in the manufacturing sector of the economy 
the rapidly changing nature of the competitive arena will continue to present new challenges and new opportunities 
we believe that the company can continue to meet the challenges presented and take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
we recognize that success depends upon many factors and take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the loyalty of our customers and for the continued support of our shareholders 
we also take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of our dedicated and skilled workforce 
their contributions are essential to the company s success both past and future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk over time  the company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
the company has not historically used derivative financial instruments 
as of december   million of floating rate debt was exposed to changes in interest rates compared to million at the prior year end 
this exposure was primarily linked to the london inter bank offering rate and the lender s prime rate under the company s term loan 
a hypothetical change in these rates would not have had a material effect on the company s annual earnings
