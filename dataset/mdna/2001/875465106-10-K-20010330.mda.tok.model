the discussion of our results of operations reported in the consolidated statements of operations compares the years ended december  and  as well as december  and certain comparisons between the periods are made on a percentage basis as well as on a weighted average gla basis  a technique which adjusts for certain increases or decreases in the number of centers and corresponding square feet related to the development  acquisition  expansion or disposition of rental properties 
the computation of weighted average gla  however  does not adjust for fluctuations in occupancy that may occur subsequent to the original opening date

this center is being developed by tanger warren development  llc tanger warren which was formed in august to identify  acquire and develop sites exclusively for us 
based on anticipated successful permitting and pre leasing  we expect stores to begin opening in late see joint ventures for discussion of the formation of tanger warren 
we have an option to purchase the retail portion of a site at the bourne bridge rotary in cape cod  massachusetts 
based on tenant demand  we plan to develop a new  square foot outlet center 
the entire site will contain more than  square feet of mixed use entertainment  retail  office and residential community built in the style of a cape cod village 
the local and state planning authorities are currently reviewing the project and final approvals are anticipated by the end of due to the extensive amount of site work and road construction  stores are not expected to be open until mid the developments or expansions that we have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled  or may not result in accretive funds from operations 
in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties 
we may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties 
any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated  or if consummated  may not result in accretive funds from operations 
in november  we terminated our contract to purchase an additional twelve acres of land in dania beach ft 
lauderdale  florida 
because of this event  we have written off all development costs associated with the expansion of our site in ft 
lauderdale  as well as additional costs associated with various other non recurring development activities at other sites which were discontinued 
the total non cash  non recurring charge for abandoned development costs in the fourth quarter of was million 
in may  the demand notes receivable totaling million from stanley k 
tanger  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  were converted into two separate term notes of which million is due from stanley k 
tanger and  is due from steven b 
tanger  the company s president and chief operating officer 
the notes amortize evenly over five years with principal and interest at a rate of per annum due quarterly 
the balances of these notes at december  were million and  respectively 
debt financings on january   we entered into a two year unsecured loan with fleet national bank and bank of america for an aggregate of million with interest payable at libor plus 
at the same time  we entered into interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million with the same institutions that effectively fixed the interest rate on this loan at

the proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the existing lines of credit 
on august   we entered into a ten year collateralized term loan with woodmen of the world life insurance society for million with interest payable at a fixed rate of

at december   approximately of the outstanding long term debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered 
the average interest rate  including loan cost amortization  on average debt outstanding for the year ended december  was 
we extended the maturities of our four unsecured lines of credit totaling million with bank of america  bank one  fleet national bank and southtrust bank until at least june  on february   the operating partnership issued million of senior  unsecured notes  maturing on february  the net proceeds of million were used to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the million senior  unsecured notes which were due march  the net proceeds were also used to repay the million libor plus term loan due january and to terminate related interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million 
the remaining proceeds were used for general operating purposes 
we intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital  including public debt as described above  to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in our best interest and our shareholders interests 
we maintain revolving lines of credit that provide for unsecured borrowings up to million  of which million was available for additional borrowings at december  after giving effect to the february debt offering  the company and the operating partnership under joint registration  could issue up to million in additional equity securities 
we are currently in the process of restocking our shelf registration for the ability to issue up to million in debt and equity securities  respectively 
we may also consider selling certain properties that do not meet our long term investment criteria as well as outparcels on existing properties to generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities 
based on cash provided by operations  existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions  the february bond offering and funds available under the shelf registration  we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during we anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
certain of our debt agreements limit the payment of dividends such that dividends will not exceed funds from operations  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or of ffo on a cumulative basis from the date of the agreement 
joint ventures effective august   we announced the formation of a joint venture with c 
randy warren jr  former senior vice president of leasing of the company 
the new entity  tanger warren development  llc tanger warren  was formed to identify  acquire and develop sites exclusively for us 
we agreed to be co managing general partners  each with ownership interest in the joint venture and any entities formed with respect to a specific project 
the investment in tanger warren is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
equity in earnings was not significant in at december  our investment in tanger warren was approximately  market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we negotiate long term fixed rate debt instruments and enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on our floating rate debt 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on a contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million 
in order to fix the interest rate at  we paid  as mentioned in debt financings above  these agreements subsequently were terminated in february at a cost of  in addition  approximately  of unamortized costs related to fixing the interest rate and  of unamortized debt issuance costs were written off in february in december  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
this agreement fixes the day libor index at through january at december   we would have had to pay  to terminate this agreement 
a decrease in the day libor index would increase this amount by approximately  the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million while the recorded value was million  respectively 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity 
funds from operations we believe that for a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be considered along with net income as presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare one equity reit with another on the basis of operating performance 
ffo is generally defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale of depreciable operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate 
we caution that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by us may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund dividends to shareholders and other cash needs 
in october  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit issued interpretive guidance regarding the calculation of ffo 
nareit s leadership determined that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results  except those results defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
all reits were encouraged to implement the recommendations of this guidance effective for fiscal periods beginning in for all periods presented in financial statements or tables 
we adopted the new nareit clarification beginning january  the adoption of the new method had the impact of reducing ffo from the amount originally reported of  in to  as a result of an asset write down of million 
below is a calculation of ffo under the new method for the years ended december   and as well as actual cash flow and other data for those years  respectively in thousands

new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by fas and fas collectively  fas 
fas is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   accordingly  we adopted fas on january  upon adoption on january   we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of  net of minority interest  in other comprehensive income loss 
during  the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee issued an exposure draft statement of position sop regarding the capitalization of costs associated with property  plant and equipment 
under the proposed sop  all property  plant and equipment related costs would be expensed unless the costs are directly identifiable with specific projects and general and administrative and overhead costs which are not payroll or payroll related and not directly related to the project would be expensed as incurred 
the expected effective date of the final sop is expected in and currently we are evaluating the effects it may have on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the securities exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab discusses the sec staff s views on certain revenue recognition transactions 
the adoption of this sab had no material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
economic conditions and outlook the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
as part of our strategy of aggressively managing our assets  we are strengthening the tenant base in several of our centers by adding strong new anchor tenants  such as polo ralph lauren  nike  gap  tommy hilfiger and nautica 
to accomplish this goal  stores may remain vacant for a longer period of time in order to recapture enough space to meet the size requirement of these upscale  high volume tenants 
consequently  we anticipate that our average occupancy level will remain strong  but may be more in line with the industry average 
approximately of our lease portfolio is scheduled to expire during the next two years 
approximately  square feet of space is up for renewal during and approximately  square feet will come up for renewal in if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
the existing tenants have already renewed approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in in addition  we continue to attract and retain additional tenants 
our factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  we reduce our operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of our combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released
