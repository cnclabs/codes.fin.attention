item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in august  we then known as varian associates  inc announced our intention to spin off our instruments business and our semiconductor equipment business to our stockholders 
we later transferred our instruments business to varian inc  or vi  a wholly owned subsidiary  and transferred our semiconductor equipment business to varian semiconductor equipment associations  inc  or vsea  a wholly owned subsidiary 
we retained the medical systems business  principally the sales and service of oncology systems and the sales of x ray tubes and imaging subsystems 
on april   we spun off vi and vsea to our common stockholders  which we refer to as the spin offs in this form k 
immediately after the spin offs  we changed our name to varian medical systems  inc or vms 
an amended and restated distribution agreement dated as of january  and other agreements govern our ongoing relationships with vi and vsea 
the financial statements for fiscal years included in this report present vi and vsea as discontinued operations under accounting principles board opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the line item earnings loss from discontinued operations net of taxes in the fiscal year financial statements reflects the net operating results of the spun off businesses  vi and vsea 
in determining the items belonging to the spun off businesses  we allocated certain corporate assets including pension assets  liabilities including profit sharing and pension benefits  and expenses including legal  accounting  employee benefits  insurance  information technology services  treasury and other corporate overhead to vi and vsea 
while we believe that the methods we used to allocate the amounts to vi and vsea are reasonable  the balances we retained may not be indicative of the amounts that we would have recorded had the spin offs occurred before or after april  the following discussion and analysis pertains to our continuing operations  unless otherwise noted 
vms is a world leader in the design and manufacture of integrated cancer therapy systems  as well as high quality  cost effective x ray tubes for original equipment manufacturers  replacement x ray tubes and imaging subsystems 
our oncology systems line consists of a fully integrated system of products  including not only linear accelerators but also sophisticated ancillary products and services 
our linear accelerators and simulators are sold and are in service around the world 
our x ray tubes are sold to most major diagnostic equipment manufacturers and cover a range of applications including computed tomography  or ct  scanning  radioscopic fluoroscopic imaging  special procedures and mammography 
sales in our ginzton technology center  or gtc  consist primarily of brachytherapy products and  to a lesser extent  amounts earned under research contracts 
gtc is also pursuing other potential new business areas  including the potential of combining new advances in focused energy and imaging technology with the latest breakthroughs in biotechnology and of using radiation to treat diseases other than cancer 
in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab we implemented the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
as a result of sab and the associated sec guidance  we changed our revenue recognition accounting policy for our linear accelerators and related hardware products in the oncology systems business and one hardware product in gtc s brachytherapy business  which collectively represent approximately half of our annual revenue 
sales of these products generally include the provision for installation and related obligations 
prior to the adoption of sab  we recognized revenue for these products upon transfer of risk of loss for products to customers  which typically coincided with shipment of products and preceded installation and customer acceptance because acceptance was deemed probable 
subsequent to the adoption of sab  our accounting policy is to defer revenue recognition on the greater of the fair value of the installation services or the amount of payment that is contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause 
for a small number of products  we do not recognize any revenue until we have completed the installation 
sab has no impact on our existing 
table of contents revenue recognition practices related to product sales in the x ray products business  software products  nor other products sold in the oncology systems business 
we recognize revenue for product sales in the x ray products business upon shipment because these products do not include any installation obligations 
we generally recognize sales for software products in the us at the time of customer acceptance  which normally is within days after installation 
we generally recognize sales for software products in the international markets days after shipment of the product  which approximates the time frame for customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue related to spare part sales in the oncology service business on shipment 
we recognize revenue related to service performed on a time and materials basis when it is earned and billable 
we recognize revenue related to service contracts ratably over the period of the related contract 
our products are generally subject to warranty  and we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty in cost of sales when we recognize the sale 
in conjunction with this change in accounting policy  we recognized an after tax charge in the first quarter of fiscal year of million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share  representing the cumulative effect on prior years of the application of sab prior periods have not been restated 
pro forma sales  gross profit  net earnings loss and net earnings loss per share assuming that the new policy had been retrospectively applied to prior years are provided under adoption of sab of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the emerging issues task force  or eitf  of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  reached consensus in on eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
we are required to implement this new accounting guidance at the same time as sab and it relates primarily to the classification of shipping and handling fees and costs in our consolidated statements of earnings 
to comply with eitf  we reported million in our x ray products business to record amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees as sales with the associated costs reported as cost of sales 
prior to fiscal year  our x ray products business reported amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling as an offset to the related cost 
we did not reclassify amounts prior to fiscal year as we consider these amounts insignificant 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this report  as well as the information contained under factors affecting our business below 
we discuss our results of continuing operations below 
all figures given in this form k are based on actual reported results  unless otherwise stated as being on a pro forma basis assuming that sab was applied retroactively to prior years 
results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday nearest september fiscal year is the week period ended september  fiscal year is the week period ended september  fiscal year is the week period ended october  fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales our sales of million under the new sab basis in fiscal year were higher than our reported sales of million under the historical accounting basis in fiscal year international sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to the reported million of sales in fiscal year product sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year service and other sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year due to the accounting change related to sab made in fiscal year  it is more meaningful to compare our sales results under the same comparative accounting basis 
fiscal year pro forma sales  applying sab  were million  therefore  on a sab comparative basis  sales increased 
table of contents year over year 
sab changes resulted in million of sales being deferred at the end of fiscal year  primarily representing the portion of the revenue that was contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause applicable to related products that were shipped and not yet installed and or accepted at september  of the million of sales we deferred at the end of fiscal year  we recognized million as sales in fiscal year upon installation and or acceptance 
similarly  sab changes resulted in million of sales being deferred at the end of fiscal year  of which we expect to recognize approximately million as sales in fiscal year for fiscal year  we expect total sales to grow in the low double digits percentile over fiscal year results  with a greater proportion of the sales shifted toward north america  primarily in our oncology systems business  over fiscal year results 
sales by segment and revenue classification fiscal year fiscal year oncology systems product million million service and other million million total oncology systems million million x ray products product million million service and other million million total x ray products million million gtc product million million service and other million million total gtc million million sales by segment and region fiscal year fiscal year oncology systems north america million million europe million million asia million million rest of the world million million total oncology systems million million x ray products north america million million europe million million asia million million rest of the world million million total x ray products million million gtc million million oncology systems sales total sales for the oncology systems business increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to the reported million of sales in fiscal year oncology systems product sales increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts and service to customers billed on a time and materials basis  increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year international sales during fiscal year increased over the reported results in fiscal year  due primarily to 
table of contents the timing of shipments as a result of customer requested delivery schedules 
north american sales increased in fiscal year over fiscal year levels to a lesser extent relative to the growth in international sales  primarily because of the high growth rate in the volume of north american shipments made in the prior fiscal year 
continued demand for imrt and imrt related products in the us is driving the growth in north american sales 
fiscal year pro forma sales  applying sab  were million of sales  therefore  on a sab comparative basis  oncology systems sales increased year over year 
sab changes resulted in million of revenue being deferred at september  primarily representing the portion of the revenue that was contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause applicable to related products that were shipped and not yet installed and or accepted at september  x ray products sales total x ray products sales increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased sales of our glass tube products in the us  partially offset by decreases of our high end ct scanner tubes sales 
while we believe that the downturn in our high end ct scanner tubes sales is temporary  we may not see growth in this product line resume until the second half of fiscal year gtc sales gtc sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year product sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts  service to customers billed on a time and materials basis and research contracts  were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the net increase in total gtc sales stemmed primarily from payments under new research contracts  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our high dose rate brachytherapy products 
gross profit we recorded gross profit of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit was in both fiscal year and fiscal year product gross profit was in both fiscal year and fiscal year gross profit for service and other sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in service and other sales stemmed primarily from increased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the oncology systems business was in fiscal year compared to a reported in fiscal year this margin increase resulted primarily from increased sales volume and higher margins in ancillary products  which more than offset the geographical mix shift toward international sales  which typically have lower margins 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the x ray products business decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decline stemmed primarily from a sales mix shift toward lower margin glass tube products 
for fiscal year  we expect gross profit as a percentage of sales at the total company level to be approximately 
the increase over the fiscal year gross profit of is primarily attributable to the anticipated geographical mix shift  primarily in our oncology systems business  toward north american sales  which typically have higher margins 
research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  representing of sales in both years 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million of sales in fiscal year compared to million of sales in fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year was 
table of contents largely attributable to higher marketing and selling expenses that are in line with increased sales  increased spending on information systems of million  higher legal costs including patent related expenses of million and million amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the restricted performance awards granted to our senior executives in fiscal year reorganization income costs  net the million of net reorganization income in fiscal year consisted of approximately million of reorganization income resulting primarily from the release of a reorganization accrual established as part of the spin offs  partially offset by million of reorganization charges primarily attributable to legal fees incurred in excess of the amounts previously accrued 
fiscal year expenses included net reorganization charges of million primarily attributable to legal fees incurred in excess of the same accrual 
the following table sets forth specific details associated with these net reorganization charges in thousands of dollars accrual at accrual at september  cash reclassifications september  payments adjustments retention bonuses  severance  and executive compensation legal  accounting  printing and investment banking fees foreign taxes excluding income taxes interest income expense  net net interest income was million for fiscal year  compared to million net interest expense for fiscal year the change reflected a combination of a million increase in interest income associated with higher cash levels in fiscal year and a million decrease in interest expense associated with average lower levels of debt in fiscal year other non operating expense we wrote off our million investment in dpix llc  or dpix  which supplies us with amorphous silicon based thin film transistor arrays  or flat panels  for our digital imaging subsystems and portalvision imaging systems  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based on the belief that this investment is other than temporarily impaired 
although we have recorded this accounting impairment charge in the current fiscal year  we will continue to participate in the dpix consortium and dpix will continue to supply us with flat panels 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rates largely as a function of benefits realized from our foreign sales corporation  research and development tax credits and foreign taxes 
for fiscal year  we estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of our pre tax earnings  research and development credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net of taxes we recorded a net non recurring charge of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles resulting from the adoption of sab and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  in fiscal year the cumulative effect of accounting change applicable to sab amounted to million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share 
this amount primarily represents a portion of the gross profits on selected systems and related hardware in our oncology systems and gtc businesses that were shipped prior to fiscal year  but were not installed and or accepted as of fiscal year end included in this million after tax charge were total sales value of million 
the million charge related to sab was partially offset by million credit to earnings resulting from the adoption of sfas  in the first quarter of fiscal year for a 
table of contents discussion of sab and sfas  see adoption of sab and derivatives instruments and hedging activities of the notes to consolidated financial statements  respectively 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales our sales of million in fiscal year were higher than our sales of million in fiscal year international sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year product sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year service and other sales were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year fiscal years and pro forma sales  applying sab  were million and million  respectively  therefore  on a sab comparative basis  sales increased year over year 
sab changes would have resulted in million of sales being deferred at the end of fiscal year  primarily representing the portion of the revenue that was contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause applicable to related products that were shipped and not yet installed and or accepted at october  of the million of sales we would have deferred at the end of fiscal year  we would have recognized million as sales in fiscal year upon satisfaction of sab criteria 
similarly  sab changes resulted in million of sales being deferred at the end of fiscal year sales by segment and revenue classification fiscal year fiscal year oncology systems product million million service and other million million total oncology systems million million x ray products product million million service and other million million total x ray products million million gtc product million million service and other million million total gtc million million sales by segment and region fiscal year fiscal year oncology systems north america million million europe million million asia million million rest of the world million million total oncology systems million million x ray products north america million million europe million million asia million million rest of the world million million total x ray products million million gtc million million 
table of contents oncology systems sales total sales for the oncology systems business increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year oncology systems product sales increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts and service to customers billed on a time and materials basis  increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year our north american sales growth of reflects the increased demand in the us for imrt that emerged in fiscal year and continued through fiscal year the decrease in european sales is primarily due to the weakness of the european market and currencies that made our products relatively more expensive in those countries 
the decrease in asian sales primarily resulted from a one time multi system sale in japan in the second quarter of fiscal year the rest of the world showed continuing strength  primarily latin america and mexico 
fiscal year pro forma sales  applying sab  were million of sales  compared to fiscal year pro forma sales of million of sales  therefore  on a sab comparative basis  oncology systems sales increased year over year 
x ray products sales total x ray products sales increased to million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year the increase is primarily attributable to strong demand for our ct tube products  particularly demand for our newer high end ct scanner tubes from a large japanese customer 
fiscal year results also reflect the impact of the ongoing consolidation of some of our european customers who purchase our x ray tube products and the shifting of purchases from europe to north america by two of our major european original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers following their business combinations with us customers 
gtc sales gtc sales were million for fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year product sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts  service to customers billed on a time and materials basis and research contracts  were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase in total gtc sales was split among new sales attributable to our june acquisition of multimedia medical systems business in treatment planning software for low dose rate brachytherapy  increased sales of our existing high dose rate brachytherapy product particularly in north america  and research contracts 
gross profit we recorded gross profit of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross profit was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year product gross profit was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in product sales resulted primarily from the higher north american sales  which traditionally have better margins than international sales  in fiscal year gross profit for service and other sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in service and other sales stemmed primarily from increased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the oncology systems business amounted to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year oncology systems margins improved primarily because of the higher sales to north america  which traditionally have better margins  although the margin improvement was somewhat restrained by weaker currencies overseas  particularly in europe 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the x ray products business decreased to in fiscal year from in 
table of contents fiscal year the gross margin decline in fiscal year was primarily due to a sales mix shift toward our newer high end ct scanner tubes that cost more to manufacture 
we also incurred higher warranty and scrap costs related to these tubes during fiscal year research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  representing and of sales  respectively 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million of sales in fiscal year  compared to million of sales in fiscal year the decrease in the percentage of sales that selling  general and administrative expenses represent reflects the faster growth of sales over expenses in fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year was primarily driven by higher marketing and selling expenses that are in line with increased market activity  particularly in north america  and higher expenditures for employee profit sharing and management incentives that are consistent with improving financial performance 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year included corporate costs incurred before the spin offs that we could not allocate under generally accepted accounting principles to discontinued operations 
reorganization costs fiscal year expenses included net reorganization charges of million primarily attributable to legal fees incurred in excess of the related accrual established as part of the spin offs 
fiscal year expenses included net reorganization charges of million 
of the million  million related to the spin offs and million related to the consolidation of our x ray manufacturing operations 
the following table sets forth specific details associated with these net reorganization charges in thousands of dollars accrual at accrual at october  cash reclassifications september  payments adjustments retention bonuses  severance  and executive compensation legal  accounting  printing and investment banking fees foreign taxes excluding income taxes other acquisition related expenses we incurred transaction costs of approximately million in fiscal year associated with our proposed and later abandoned acquisition of impac medical systems  inc the transaction costs were largely made up of legal  accounting and investment adviser expenses 
interest expense  net our net interest expense was million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense resulted primarily from a  one time interest payment received in connection with a federal income tax refund in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and a decrease in interest expense 
we had lower levels of debt during fiscal year compared to fiscal year when we contributed a substantial amount of cash and debt to vi and vsea as part of the spin offs 
we also paid down million of short term debt in fiscal year taxes on earnings our effective tax rate was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the fiscal year rate was significantly higher principally due to certain reorganization costs related to the spin offs that were non deductible 
net earnings our net earnings from continuing operations were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase in net earnings is primarily attributable to 
table of contents increased sales in fiscal year and the inclusion in fiscal year of substantial reorganization related net expenses incurred as part of the spin offs 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  purchases of business assets and funding of continuing operations 
our sources of cash include sales  net interest income and borrowings under short term notes payable and long term loans 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
before the spin offs  we historically incurred or managed debt at the parent level 
as part of the spin offs  the parties agreed to the following terms in the distribution agreement varian associates  inc would contribute to vsea million in cash and cash equivalents 
varian associates  inc would provide vsea with net worth as defined in the distribution agreement of at least million and consolidated debt as defined in the distribution agreement of no more than million 
vi would assume of the remaining outstanding indebtedness under varian associates  inc s term loan 
varian associates  inc would transfer cash and cash equivalents to vi such that vi and varian associates  inc  then renamed vms  would each have approximately of the net debt of both vms and vi at the time of the distribution 
subject to necessary adjustments  vms would have a net worth of between and of the aggregate net worth of vms and vi 
as a result  we transferred million in cash and cash equivalents to vsea and vi  and vsea and vi assumed million in debt during fiscal year at september   we had million of long term loans and million of short term notes payable 
interest rates on the outstanding long term loans on this date range from to with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
as of september   the weighted average interest rate on the short term notes payable was 
the long term loans currently contain covenants that limit future borrowings and cash dividend payments 
the covenants also require us to maintain specified levels of working capital and operating results 
at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents approximately of which was held abroad and would be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated to the us  an increase of million over our cash and cash equivalents levels of million at september  our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years  and were as follows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year  compared to generating net cash of million in fiscal year and using net cash of million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we had million of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises  which contributed significantly to the increase in our cash from operations from fiscal year to fiscal year another contributor was our increase in net earnings before the non cash cumulative adjustments related to the changes in accounting principles applicable to sab and sfas to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in addition to the tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and net earnings  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year related primarily to million in other net non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  write offs and others and million increase in trade accounts payable  product warranty and advance payments from customers excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on cash  partially offset by additions to inventory of million excluding the effect of the sab cumulative adjustment and a decrease in accrued expenses and other of million excluding the 
table of contents effects of the sab cumulative adjustment and the foreign exchange rates on cash 
the primary difference between our fiscal year and fiscal year operating net cash flows results relates to the increase in net earnings to million of net earnings in fiscal year from million of net loss including discontinued operations in fiscal year the net loss in fiscal year was largely due to losses from our spun off businesses as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles 
investing activities used million of net cash in fiscal year  compared to using million of net cash in fiscal year and providing million of net cash in fiscal year the net cash used in fiscal years and was primarily for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the million of net cash provided in fiscal year included proceeds of million from the sale of our long term leasehold interests in several palo alto facilities  related buildings and other corporate assets  which was partially offset by million used to purchase property  plant and equipment and the multimedia medical systems business in june financing activities provided net cash of million in fiscal year  compared to using net cash of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases  partially offset by purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program 
we used million to pay down short term debt during fiscal year this was partially offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
the million net cash outlay in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the aggregate of million we contributed to vi and vsea in connection with the spin offs  which was somewhat offset by million proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
total debt as a percentage of total capital improved to at september  from at september  largely due to the increase of our stockholders equity during fiscal year the ratio of current assets to current liabilities improved to to at september  from to at fiscal year end at september   we had million available in unused uncommitted lines of credit as well as an additional million in an unused committed revolving credit facility 
we expect our future capital expenditures to approximate of sales in each fiscal year 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the us and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate positively and negatively as a result of the shifting influences of these factors  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash to be generated from operations and our borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements through fiscal year stock repurchase program on august   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase by vms of up to one million shares of our common stock over the next twelve months 
this stock repurchase program was approved in an effort to enhance shareholder value and to offset dilution from both the employee stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase program 
the stock repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable state and federal law and in accordance with the terms and subject to the restrictions of rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
shares will be retired and cancelled upon repurchase 
as of september   we had spent million to repurchase  shares of our common stock under this program 
deferred stock compensation during fiscal year  we granted  restricted performance shares to several of our senior executives and  shares of restricted common stock to a senior executive under our omnibus stock plan and our stock option plan 
the restricted performance shares will vest five years from the date of 
table of contents grant subject to the employees having satisfied defined performance objectives 
upon vesting  we will deliver one share of our common stock for each performance share granted to the employee 
in the event that we terminate an employee s service prior to the end of the vesting period or an employee retires more than three years prior to the end of the vesting period  any unvested performance shares are forfeited 
however  if the employee s termination is by reason of death or disability or if we terminate the employee for any other reason other than for cause  the performance shares will become immediately vested 
the restricted common stock granted to the senior executive will vest in the following manner the first one third three months from the date of grant  the second one third fifteen months from the date of grant  and the last one third twenty seven months from the date of grant 
in the event that we terminate the employee s service prior to the end of the vesting period or the employee retires more than three years prior to the date such vesting is deemed to have occurred  any unvested restricted common stock is forfeited and we will automatically reacquire the unvested restricted stock at no cost 
an employee may not sell or otherwise transfer unvested shares 
we measure deferred stock compensation for both the restricted performance shares and the restricted common stock based on the stock s fair value on the date of grant and we amortize the deferred stock compensation over the stocks respective vesting periods 
in connection with these grants  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
for fiscal year  we recognized in selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of deferred stock compensation of million 
we estimate that we will amortize the remaining deferred compensation of approximately million at september  as follows million during each of fiscal years through  and million during fiscal year the amount of deferred compensation expense recorded and to be recorded in future periods could decrease if the restricted awards for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union  or eu  adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
following the introduction of the euro  the local currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries until january  during this transition period  goods and services may be paid for by using either the euro or the participating country s local currency 
thereafter  the local currencies will be cancelled and the euro will be used for all transactions by and between the eleven participating members of the eu 
we have implemented systems to begin conducting business with our customers in both the euro and the respective national currency 
systems and processes that are initially impacted by this dual currency requirement are customer billing and receivables  payroll and cash management activities  including cash collections and disbursements 
to accomplish compliance  we are making the necessary systems and process changes and are working with our financial institutions on various cash management issues 
we have modified our systems to accommodate recording transactions in the euro and have commenced recording transactions in the euro in the eight countries of the european community in which we currently do business 
we currently believe that the costs associated with implementing and completing the euro conversion  as well as business and market implications  if any  associated with the euro conversion  will not be material to our results of operations or financial condition in any year or in the aggregate 
the competitive impact of increased cross border price transparency  however  is uncertain both with respect to products sold by us as well as products and services which we purchase 
our ongoing efforts with respect to the euro conversion  and those of our significant customers and suppliers  including financial institutions may  at some time in the future  reveal as yet unidentified or not fully understood issues that may not be addressable in a timely fashion  or that may cause unexpected competitive or market effects 
these issues  if not resolved favorably  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the future 
legal proceedings we are a party to three related federal legal actions involving claims by independent service organizations  or isos  that our policies and business practices relating to replacement parts violate the antitrust laws 
isos purchase replacement parts from us and compete with us in servicing the linear accelerators we 
table of contents manufacture 
in response to several threats of litigation regarding the legality of our parts policy  we filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the northern district of california in asking for a determination that our new policies are legal and enforceable and damages against two of the isos for misappropriation of our trade secrets  unfair competition  copyright infringement and related claims 
later  four defendants filed separate claims in other jurisdictions raising issues allegedly related to those in the declaratory relief action and seeking injunctive relief and damages against us for million for each plaintiff 
we defeated the defendants motion for a preliminary injunction in us district court in texas about our policies 
the isos defendants amended the complaint to include class action allegations  alleged a variety of other anti competitive business practices and filed a motion for class certification  which the us district court in texas heard in july no decision  however  has been entered 
the parties have agreed to consolidate our claims from the northern district of california to the action in the us district court in texas 
after the spin offs  we retained the liabilities related to the medical systems business before the spin offs 
in addition  under the agreement governing the spin offs  we agreed to manage and defend liabilities related to legal proceedings and environmental matters arising from corporate or discontinued operations 
each of vi and vsea must generally indemnify us for one third of these liabilities after adjusting for any insurance proceeds we realize or tax benefits we receive  including specified environmental related liabilities described below  and to fully assume and indemnify us for liabilities arising from each of their operations before the spin offs 
the availability of the indemnities will depend upon the future financial strength of vi and vsea 
given the long term nature of some of the liabilities  the relevant company may be unable to fund indemnities in the future 
a court could also disregard the contractual allocation of indebtedness  liabilities and obligations among the parties and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to another party  particularly if the other party were to refuse or was unable to pay or perform any of its allocated obligations 
in addition  the agreement governing the spin offs generally provides that if a court prohibits any of the companies from satisfying its indemnification obligations  then the indemnification obligations will be shared equally between the two other companies 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations  these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials  and  in the event of such an incident  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
in addition  we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations 
for example  several countries are proposing to require manufacturers to take back  recycle and dispose of products at the end of the equipment s useful life 
the eu has some proposed directives that may require medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of the products useful life and to be unable to use some hazardous substances in products sold in the eu 
as the directives are currently drafted  effective in  our products sold in the eu could not contain listed dangerous substances  and product collection programs would have to be in place within months of adoption of these rules 
in addition  the proposed directives may require that  beginning in  we establish an agreement with our european customers at the time of sale of medical equipment for the recovery and environmentally sound disposal of the medical equipment or any of its components 
we may also be required to identify the locations of dangerous substances in our medical equipment so we or if the product is sent to a recovery facility  that facility can remove these components eg  mercury switches  batteries  printed circuit boards  etc 
before product recycling or disposal 
if approved  each member of the eu must set its own regulations to implement the directives  which may vary 
these directives  if approved  would create increased costs for our operations 

table of contents from the time we began operating  we have handled and disposed of hazardous materials and wastes following procedures that were considered appropriate under regulations  if any  existing at the time 
we also hired companies to dispose of wastes generated by our operations 
under various laws such as the federal superfund law and under our obligations concerning operations before the spin offs  we are overseeing environmental cleanup projects from our pre spun off operations and as applicable reimbursing third parties such as the us environmental protection agency or other responsible parties for cleanup activities 
under the terms of the agreement governing the distribution  we are obligated to pay one third of specified environmental liabilities caused by operations before the spin offs  with vi and vsea obligated for the balance 
the cleanup projects we are overseeing are being conducted under the direction of or in consultation with relevant regulatory agencies 
we estimated these cleanup projects would take up to years to complete 
as described below  we have accrued a total of million to cover our liabilities for these cleanup projects we have developed a range of potential costs covering a variety of cleanup activities  including three cleanup projects  reimbursements to third parties  project management costs and legal costs 
there are  however  various uncertainties in these estimates that make it difficult to develop a best estimate 
our estimate of future costs to complete these cleanup activities ranges from million to million 
for these estimates  we have not discounted the costs to present dollars because of the uncertainties that make it difficult to develop a best estimate and have accrued million  which is the amount at the low end of the range 
for eight cleanup projects  we have sufficient knowledge to develop better estimates of our future costs 
while our estimate of future costs to complete these cleanup projects  including third party claims  ranges from million to million  our best estimate within that range is million 
for these projects we have accrued million  which is our best estimate of the million discounted to present dollars at  net of inflation 
for one particular site included in the million accrual  we reassessed the costs of future cleanup activities  including paying third party claims  based on a new feasibility study done in late fiscal year using a new plan for treatment 
we anticipate that the new plan for treatment will take approximately years to complete  which spans a much shorter time frame than the previous plan for treatment which was expected to take approximately years to complete 
we estimated that our share of the future costs to complete the cleanup projects for this site under the new plan for treatment ranges from million to million 
our best estimate within that range was million and we accrued million  which is our best estimate of the million discounted at  net of inflation 
at fiscal year end  for the same site  our estimated share of the future costs to complete the cleanup projects under the previous plan for treatment ranged from million to million 
our best estimate within that range was million and we accrued million  which was our best estimate of the million discounted at  net of inflation  at that time 
at september   our reserve for environmental liabilities  based upon future environmental related costs estimated as of that date  was calculated as follows total recurring non recurring anticipated costs costs future costs dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount 
table of contents when we developed the estimates above  we considered the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties 
these amounts are  however  only estimates and may be revised in the future as we get more information on these projects 
we may also spend more or less than these estimates 
based on current information  we believe that our reserves are adequate 
at this time  management believes that it is remote that any single environmental event would have a materially adverse impact on our cash flows in any single fiscal year 
we spent million and million net of amounts borne by vi and vsea during fiscal year and  respectively  on environmental investigation  cleanup and third party claim costs 
we spent million in fiscal year net of amounts borne or would have been borne by vi and vsea on similar activities 
in  we filed a lawsuit against insurance companies for recovery of our environmental investigation  cleanup and third party claim costs 
we received cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from various insurance companies in    and in addition  we have an agreement with an insurance company to pay a portion of our past and future expenditures 
as a result of this agreement  we have a million receivable included in other assets as of september  we believe that this receivable is collectible because it is based on a binding  written settlement agreement with a financially viable insurance company 
although we continue to aggressively pursue other recoveries  we have not reduced our liability in anticipation of recovery from third parties for claims that we made 
our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years  and over that time in the course of those operations  these facilities have used substances which are or might be considered hazardous  and we have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous 
therefore  it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that we cannot now predict 

table of contents subsequent event on november   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend where holders of our common stock will receive one additional share of our common stock for each share of common stock held on the record date 
the distribution of the shares will be payable on or around january  to stockholders of record as of december  the following unaudited summary reflects the pro forma net earnings per share restated for the two for one stock split fiscal years in thousands  except per share data earnings from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net earnings loss pro forma net earnings loss per share basic continuing operations discontinued operations cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles pro forma net earnings loss per share basic pro forma net earnings loss per share diluted continuing operations discontinued operations cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles pro forma net earnings loss per share diluted shares used in the calculation of pro forma net earnings loss per share pro forma weighted average shares outstanding basic pro forma weighted average shares outstanding diluted additionally  on the effective date of the two for one split  we will restate our common stock outstanding on our consolidated balance sheets at september  and september  to  and  respectively  and will reclassify million and million from capital in excess of par value to common stock at september  and september   respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting and standards board  or fasb  issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  or sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under a single method the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment upon initial adoption of the statement and on an annual basis going forward 
the amortization of goodwill will cease upon adoption of sfas the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we are required to 
table of contents adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year  but we have elected to adopt it early in the first quarter of fiscal year beginning on september  management is currently evaluating the effect of the early implementation of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
we expect that the early adoption of sfas will result in an annual reduction of approximately million to million of goodwill amortization charge or approximately to per diluted share  which is currently included in selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods 
sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
and accounting principles board opinion no 
 however  it retains the requirement of opinion no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting our business the following factors  in conjunction with the other information included in this annual report  should be carefully considered 
if we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation  our products may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer the marketplace for our products is characterized by rapid change and technological innovation 
because our products often have long development and government approval cycles  we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation 
we may be unable to do so  our competitors may develop improved products or processes  or the marketplace may conclude that the task our product was designed to do is no longer an element of a generally accepted diagnostic or treatment regimen 
if this occurs  the market for our products may be adversely affected and they may become less useful or obsolete 
any development adversely affecting the market for our equipment would result in us having to reduce production volumes or to discontinue manufacturing and would reduce our revenues 
if we are unable to develop new generations of products and enhancements to existing products  we may be unable to attract or retain customers our success is dependent upon the successful development  introduction and commercialization of new generations of products and enhancements to existing products 
our products are technologically complex and must keep pace with rapid and significant technological change  comply with rapidly evolving industry standards and compete effectively with new product introductions of our competitors 
accordingly  many of our products require significant planning  design  development and testing at the technological  product and manufacturing process levels 
these activities require significant capital commitments and investments on our part 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and the associated costs  are also affected by our ability to properly identify customer needs  prove feasibility of new products  limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production  limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals  
table of contents accurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns caused by phase in of new products and phase out of old products  price our products competitively  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing  installation  warranty and maintenance of the products  manage customer acceptance and payment for products  limit customer demands for retrofits of both new and old products  and anticipate and compete successfully with competitors efforts 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop  manufacture and phase in new products or product enhancements 
without the successful introduction of new products and product enhancements  we may be unable to attract and retain customers and our revenue and operating results will suffer 
in addition  even if customers accept new products or product enhancements  the revenues from such products may not be sufficient to offset the significant costs associated with making such products available to customers 
if we are unable to provide the significant education and training required for the health care market to accept our products  our business will suffer in order to achieve market acceptance for our products  we are often required to educate physicians about the use of a new procedure  overcome physician objections to some of the effects of the product or its related treatment regimen and convince health care payors that the benefits of the product and its related treatment regimen outweigh its costs 
the timing of our competitors introduction of products and the market acceptance of their products may also make this process more difficult 
we cannot be sure that any products we develop will gain any significant market acceptance and market share among physicians  patients and health care payors  even if required regulatory approvals are obtained 
we face significant costs in order to comply with laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of medical devices  and if we fail or are delayed in obtaining regulatory approvals or fail to comply with applicable regulations  we may be unable to distribute our products or may be subject to civil or criminal penalties as a manufacturer of medical devices  our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation  including the provisions of the fdc act 
our commercial distribution activities in many foreign countries are also subject to government regulation 
obtaining fda market clearances or certifications can be time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
we may fail to obtain the necessary clearances or certifications or may be unduly delayed in doing so 
furthermore  even if we are granted regulatory clearances  the clearances may include significant limitations on the indicated uses of the product  which may limit the market for those products 
the fda review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products  which may delay or hinder a product s timely entry into the marketplace 
if we were unable to achieve fda approval for a product  or were limited or unduly delayed in doing so  our business would suffer 
in addition to fda required market clearances and certifications  the fda and the us federal trade commission also regulate the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices 
we are also subject to other federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations and recommendations relating to medical devices  safe working conditions and laboratory and manufacturing practices 
if we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  it can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  suspensions or losses of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
government regulation also may delay for a considerable period of time or prevent the marketing and full commercialization of future products or services that we may develop  and or impose 
table of contents costly requirements on our business 
in addition  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could affect the timing of  or prevent us from obtaining  future regulatory approvals  or could otherwise adversely affect our business 
a further discussion of government regulation of our industry and our products may be found in part i  item of this form k  business government regulation 
health care reforms and changes to third party reimbursements for radiation oncology services may affect demand for our products the us government has in the past  and may in the future  consider and state and local as well as a number of foreign governments are considering or have adopted health care policies intended to curb rising health care costs 
these policies include rationing of government funded reimbursement for health care services and imposing price controls on medical products and services providers 
significant changes in the health care systems in the united states or elsewhere would likely have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services and the way we conduct business 
we are unable to predict what health care reform legislation or regulation  if any  will be enacted in the united states or elsewhere  whether other health care legislation or regulation affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future  or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
in addition  sales of some of our products indirectly depend on whether adequate reimbursement is available to our customers for the treatment provided by those products from third party health care payors  such as government health care insurance programs  including the medicare and medicaid programs  private insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
the availability of such reimbursement affects our customers decisions to purchase capital equipment 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical procedures or limiting or prohibiting reimbursement for specific services or devices or through other means  and we cannot be sure that they will reimburse our customers at levels sufficient to enable us to achieve or maintain sales and price levels for our products 
without adequate support from third party payors  the market for our products may be limited 
there is no uniform policy on reimbursement among third party payors  nor can we be sure that procedures using our products will qualify for reimbursement from third party payors 
foreign countries also have their own health care reimbursement systems  and we cannot be sure that third party reimbursement will be made available with respect to our products under any foreign reimbursement system 
a further discussion of health care reforms and government funded reimbursement for health care products and services such as ours may be found in part i  item of this form k  business government regulation 
because our products involve the delivery of radiation and diagnostic imaging of the human body  product defects may result in material product liability claims that could harm future sales and require us to pay material uninsured claims the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture or use of our systems may be small or nonexistent 
if a system we designed or manufactured is defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  improper use of the system or other reasons  the system may need to be recalled  possibly at our expense 
furthermore  the adverse effect of a product recall might not be limited to the cost of the recall 
for example  a product recall could cause applicable regulatory authorities to investigate us as well as cause other customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us 
recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in our incurring substantial costs  losing revenues and loss of reputation  each of which would harm our business 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture and sale of medical devices 
because our products involve the delivery of radiation to the human body or are involved in diagnostic imaging of the human body  the possibility for significant injury and or death exists 
as such  we may face substantial liability to patients for damages resulting from the faulty design  manufacture and 
table of contents servicing of our products 
we may also face liability due to claims arising out of potential past and future product defects and personal injury matters related to the general electric radiotherapy service business that we purchased in december and for which we have assumed liability 
we have historically maintained limited product liability insurance coverage in an amount we deem sufficient for each of our businesses 
these product liability insurance policies are expensive and have deductible amounts and self insured retentions 
in the future  these policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts  if at all 
in addition  the insurance coverage we have obtained may not be adequate 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied or limited and for which indemnification is not available would require us to pay such uncovered amounts  which could be substantial 
we utilize distributors for a portion of our sales  the loss of which could harm our sales in the territory serviced by these distributors we have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors principally in foreign countries 
if these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced  our sales in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected 
continued consolidation among oems in the x ray tube products market could reduce our sales of x ray tube products we have noticed a trend toward consolidation in the oem markets of our x ray tubes business over the past few years 
the ongoing consolidation of customers who purchase our x ray tube products  including the consolidation of these customers into companies that already manufacture x ray tubes  could result in less predictable and reduced sales of our x ray tubes products 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile  which could cause losses to our stockholders we have and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our operating results 
the timing and amount of revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to estimate revenues and operational results prior to the end of any quarter 
many of our products require significant capital expenditures 
accordingly  some of our sales are quite large in dollar amounts  and the timing of these sales could affect our quarterly earnings 
factors that may affect timing of these sales and adversely affect our quarterly operating results include delay in shipment due  for example  to unanticipated construction delays  cancellations by customers or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  delay in the installation and or acceptance of a product  or an unexpected change in a customer s financial solvency or ability to obtain financing 
furthermore  our quarterly operating results may also be affected by a number of other factors  including changes in our or our competitors pricing or discount levels  seasonality of revenue  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the relative portion of our revenue represented by our various products  timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products or product enhancements by us and by our competitors  changes in the costs of raw materials  labor or supplies  and changes in the general economic conditions in the regions in which we do business 

table of contents because many of our operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels and a high percentage of such expenses are fixed for the short term  a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our orders and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as accurate predictors of future revenues as the timing of such revenues is dependent upon completion of customer site preparation and construction  installation scheduling  customer capital budgeting and financing  receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and other factors 
accordingly  we cannot be sure if or when the orders will mature into revenue 
our operating results in one or more future periods may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec and various other bodies 
a change in interpretations of  or our application of  these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
the sec recently issued sab  which we adopted in the fourth quarter effective for fiscal year and going forward 
the adoption of sab has resulted in our deferring recognition of a portion of our revenue for many of our hardware products until installation and or customer acceptance of the product 
as a result  delays in installation and or acceptance of products  either by the customer or by us  will have a greater effect on our results of operations in a given period than in the past 
the adoption of sab also may make it more difficult to estimate revenues and operational results prior to the end of any period  and its impact on our historical and projected financial performance may not be fully understood by our investors and analysts 
in addition  the guidance regarding sab may continue to evolve 
any of these factors may result in our operating results in a given period falling below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would almost certainly cause the price of our stock to decline 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may lose market share to companies with greater resources or who are able to develop more effective technologies  or we could be forced to reduce our prices the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition and pricing pressure 
there are a number of companies that currently offer  or are in the process of developing  products that compete with the products we offer 
our products and services compete with those of a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies  some with greater resources  financial or otherwise  than we have  and the rapid technological changes occurring in our markets are expected to lead to the entry of new competitors 
our ability to anticipate technological changes and introduce enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to expand and remain competitive 
existing competitors actions and new entrants may have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability 
these competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we currently use or market or that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  the timing of competitors introduction of products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products 
if we are unable to develop competitive products  gain regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of such products to the market as quickly and effectively as our competitors  market acceptance of our products may be limited and our sales reduced 
a further discussion of competition in our markets may be found in part i  item of this form k  business competition 
a high percentage of our sales are international  and economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales or make them less predictable we conduct business globally 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result  we must provide significant service and 
table of contents support on a worldwide basis  and we have sales and service offices located throughout europe  asia  latin america and australia 
in addition  we have manufacturing and research operations in england  switzerland  finland and france 
we have invested substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers 
we intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets  although we cannot be sure we will able to compete successfully in the international market or meet the service and support needs of such customers 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including the difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through many foreign country s legal systems  the longer payment cycles associated with many foreign customers  the possibility that foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  fluctuations in exchange rates  which may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  our ability to obtain us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in the political  regulatory or economic conditions in a country or region  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
our results may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates we sell our products internationally and are subject to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage this risk through established policies and procedures that include the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have historically entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of operational sales orders and balance sheet exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our forward exchange contracts generally range from one to twelve months in original maturity  and no forward exchange contract has an original maturity greater than one year 
at september   we had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million and to buy foreign currencies totaling million 
although we engage in hedging strategies that may offset the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the protection these strategies provide will be affected by the timing of transactions  the effectiveness of the hedges measured by how closely the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item  forecast volatility and the extent of movement of exchange rates 
if our hedging strategies are not effective in offsetting the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results may be harmed 
we may incur substantial costs in protecting our intellectual property  and if we are not able to do so  our competitive position would be harmed we place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and to the marketplace 
we file applications as appropriate for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes 
we cannot be sure  however  that patents now owned or patents that will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by  or licensed to  vms  or that the claims allowed under any issued patents  will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology position against competitors 
issued patents owned by  or licensed to  vms may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or the rights granted under the patent may not provide us with competitive advantages 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources if we have to assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome to any such litigation 
table of contents could harm us 
in addition  we may not be able to detect infringement or may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
we also rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret and other laws  and contractual restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title  including confidentiality agreements with vendors  strategic partners  co developers  employees  consultants and other third parties  to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that such protections will prove adequate and that contractual agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breaches  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by others 
we have trademarks  both registered and unregistered  that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace 
we cannot assure you that our trademarks will not be used by unauthorized third parties 
we also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may not be aware of intellectual property rights of others that relate to our products  services or technologies 
from time to time  we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights relating to their products 
such claims are often  but not always  settled by mutual agreement satisfactorily without litigation 
any contest regarding patents or other intellectual property could by costly and time consuming  and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any such contest 
if we are unsuccessful  we may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of our products  or may be required to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
we cannot assure you that any licenses required would be made available on acceptable terms or at all 
the nature of our business exposes us to environmental claims or cleanup expenses  which could cause us to pay significant amounts we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations  these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials  and  in the event of such an incident  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
in addition  we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for a further discussion of environmental matters relating to our business  see environmental matters 
since we depend upon a limited group of suppliers for some product components  the loss of a supplier could reduce our ability to manufacture products or increase our costs we obtain some of the components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers  or in some cases a single source supplier  for example  the source wires for high dose afterloaders  klystrons for linear accelerators  imaging panels  non coated array sensors and coating for array sensors for the flat panels  specialized integrated circuits for imaging subassemblies  and some targets  housings and glass bulbs for x ray tubes 
if we lose of any of these suppliers including any single source supplier  we would be required to obtain one or more replacement suppliers and may be required to conduct a significant level of product development to incorporate new parts into our products 
we believe that we may be able to obtain alternative sources for such components when necessary  although the need to change suppliers or to alternate between 
table of contents suppliers might cause material delays in delivery or significantly increase costs 
although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against business interruption loss  there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
disruptions or loss of any of our limited source components or subassemblies  including the ones referenced above  could adversely affect our business and financial results and could result in damage to customer relationships 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our business if we are not able to retain  hire and integrate sufficient qualified personnel our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of certain of our key executive  technical  sales  marketing and engineering personnel 
it also depends on our ability to attract  expand  integrate train and retain our management team  qualified engineering personnel and technical personnel 
the loss of services of key employees could adversely affect our business 
competition for such personnel can be intense  particularly in the labor markets around our facilities in palo alto  california and salt lake city  utah 
if we fail to hire  train or retain qualified personnel  we will not be able to maintain and expand our business 
if we are not able to match our manufacturing capacity with demand for our products  our financial results may suffer as a manufacturer of medical devices with a long production cycle  we need to anticipate demand for our products in order to ensure adequate manufacturing capacity 
we cannot assure you that we will be successfully able to do so 
if our manufacturing capacity does not keep pace with product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our financial results and overall business 
conversely  if demand for our products decrease  the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our financial results 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to earthquake  power loss  and other events beyond our control  which would adversely affect our business we conduct a significant portion of our activities including manufacturing  administration and data processing at facilities located in the state of california in seismically active areas that have experienced major earthquakes in the past 
we carry limited earthquake insurance on our facilities 
however  such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 
in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting our facilities  it could significantly disrupt our operations  delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities 
in addition  our facilities in the state of california may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies 
such shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts  which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business 
the conversion to the euro could adversely affect various aspects of our business conversion to the euro will require us to convert our software applications to support euro requirements and implement sales documentation  quotations  price lists and catalogs  contracts  accounting and tax records and related historical documents in the euro over the required time periods 
this process will be costly  and if we experience difficulties in the conversion  could damage customer relationships 
additionally  competitive impact of cross border price transparency resulting from product pricing in a common currency in multiple european countries could adversely affect margins on sales to customers in those countries 

table of contents if the spin off of vi and vsea did not qualify as a tax free spin off  we could incur a significant tax liability we received a tax ruling from the internal revenue service  or the irs  in connection with the spin offs to the effect  among other things  that neither vms nor the holders of varian common stock would recognize a gain or loss as a result of the spin offs 
these rulings  while generally binding upon the irs  are subject to factual representations and assumptions 
if our factual representations and assumptions were incorrect in any material respect  this ruling would be jeopardized 
we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause our representations and assumptions to be untrue 
vms  vi and vsea have agreed to certain restrictions on their future actions to further assure that the spin offs will qualify as tax free 
if one or both of the april  spin offs failed to qualify as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  then we will recognize a gain equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock of the non qualifying company or companies and our adjusted tax basis in the stock 
if we were to recognize gain on one or both of the spin offs  this gain and the resulting tax liability likely would be very substantial 
the tax sharing agreement between vms  vsea and vi allocates responsibility for the possible corporate tax burden resulting from the spin offs 
each of the three companies is responsible for any corporate taxes resulting from the spin offs attributable to action taken or permitted by that entity or its affiliates after the spin offs

our stockholder rights plan and provisions of our certificate of incorporation may discourage a take over and therefore limit the price of our common stock we have a stockholder rights plan which  under specific circumstances  would significantly dilute the equity interest in our company of a person or persons seeking to acquire control of our company without the prior approval of our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation also includes provisions that may make an acquisition of control of our company without the approval of our board of directors more difficult 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to two primary types of market risks foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange as a global concern  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures related to non us dollar denominated sales and purchases throughout europe  asia and australia 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european monetary union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
following the introduction of the euro  the local currencies of the participating countries are scheduled to remain legal tender until january  during this transition period  goods and services may be paid for in either euro or the participating country s local currencies 
thereafter  only the euro will be the legal tender in the participating countries 
we continue to evaluate  among other issues  the impact of the euro conversion on our foreign currency exposure 
based on our evaluation to date  we do not expect the euro conversion to create any change in currency exposure due to our existing hedging practices 
we have significant international transactions in foreign currencies and address related financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s economy  and adhere to a policy of hedging foreign currency exposures that result from international firmly committed sales orders with forward exchange contracts 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
table of contents to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally range from one to twelve months in original maturity 
we do not have any forward exchange contract with an original maturity greater than one year 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units having us dollar functional currencies 
we enter into these monthly foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
forward exchange contracts outstanding  their unrealized gains or losses and their fair values as of the fiscal year end are summarized as follows fiscal year end notional notional value value unrealized fair sold purchased gain loss value dollars in millions australian dollar brazilian real british pound canadian dollar danish krone euro dollar japanese yen norwegian krone swedish krona swiss franc thailand baht totals the fair value of forward exchange contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
the notional amounts of forward exchange contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and notes payable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  and the investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments in short term investments 
we primarily enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by interest rate movements since the investment maturities are short 
our long term debt of million at september  carries a weighted average fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in various installments over a ten year period  beginning in our short term notes payable to bank of million at september  carry a weighted average interest rate of 

table of contents the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents and debt obligations 
fiscal year thereafter total dollars in millions assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate liabilities notes payable average interest rate long term debt average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents a portion of which was held abroad at september  and would be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated in the us approximates the principal amounts reflected above based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our long term debt is estimated to be million 
we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  it requires considerable judgment in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instrument could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases
