b ebitda  as adjusted consists of operating income plus depreciation  amortization  preopening expenses  restructuring charge  missouri nevada investigations and fines  gain on sale of missouri assets and impairment loss 
the company believes that in addition to cash flows and net income  ebitda  as adjusted is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing the operating performance of the company 
together with net income and cash flows  ebitda  as adjusted provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service debt and incur capital expenditures 
to evaluate ebitda  as adjusted and the trends it depicts  the components should be considered 
the impact of interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  preopening expenses  restructuring charge  missouri nevada investigations and fines  gain on the sale of missouri assets and impairment loss  each of which can significantly affect the company s results of operations and liquidity and should be considered in evaluating the company s operating performance  cannot be determined from ebitda  as adjusted 
further  ebitda  as adjusted does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and does not necessarily indicate cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  it should be noted that not all gaming companies that report ebitda or adjustments to such measures may calculate ebitda  or such adjustments in the same manner as the company  and therefore  the company s measure of ebitda  as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other gaming companies 
consolidated net revenues  cash flows from operating activities  and ebitda  as adjusted for the fiscal year ended december  increased as compared to the transition period these increases are due to the transition period consisting of nine months as compared to the fiscal year ended december   which is twelve months 
the above table presents certain results of operations from the unaudited twelve month period ended december  for comparison purposes 
consolidated net revenues the increase in consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  is due to increased revenues at all of the company s properties with the exception of station casino st 
charles  which decreased slightly 
increased revenues at the nevada operations are partially a result of the acquisition of santa fe station on october  and the subsequent completion in late november of the renovation and retheming of the casino and restaurants 
in addition  revenues at the nevada operations increased in the early part of the year due to the introduction of the boarding pass player rewards program in april  which makes it more convenient for customers to take advantage of products  services and amenities offered under the station brand 
net revenues at the missouri operations increased slightly 
however  the results were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter due to inclement weather throughout the midwest  the anticipated sale of the missouri operations and the timing of the sale of the missouri operations on december  the increase in consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  is due to increased revenues at all of the company s properties 
increased revenues at the nevada operations are partially a result of the completed master planned expansions at texas station and sunset station  which were completed in february and november  respectively 
in addition  revenues at the nevada operations increased due to the introduction of the boarding pass player rewards program in april  which makes it more convenient for customers to take advantage of the station brand 
net revenues at the missouri operations increased primarily due to station casino kansas city which generated a increase 
operating income operating margin the company s operating income was impacted by certain charges credits in each of the above periods that affect the ability to analyze year to year comparisons 
the following table identifies these charges credits dollars in thousands twelve fiscal years ended months december  ended transition december  period unaudited operating income     operating margin certain charges credits gain on sale of missouri assets  missouri nevada investigations and fines  preopening expenses  restructuring charge  impairment loss    operating income  excluding certain charges credits     operating margin  excluding certain charges credits consolidated operating income  excluding certain charges credits  improved by million in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  with operating income at all of the company s properties increasing with the exception of texas station 
the increases at the nevada operations are attributed to the same factors affecting consolidated net revenues discussed above  to the elimination of the equipment lease at sunset station in october and the continued focus on cost controls at each of the properties 
the increases at the missouri operations are primarily due to significant improvement in operations at both station casino st 
charles and station casino kansas city 
operating income at station casino st 
charles increased significantly due to a reconfiguration of the gaming operations which transferred all gaming activities from the riverboat to the barge 
the new configuration is much more efficient from a cost perspective than the two facility layout 
station casino kansas city continued to benefit from increases in the overall gaming market in the kansas city area 
the consolidated operating margin  excluding certain charges credits  improved in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december   due to the operating margin at the missouri operations improving percentage points as a result of the elimination of costs associated with the riverboat in st 
charles  as discussed above  and the nevada operations improving percentage points due primarily to the revenue growth discussed above 
consolidated operating income  excluding certain charges credits  improved by million in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  with operating income at all of the company s properties increasing 
the increases at the nevada properties are attributed to the same factors affecting consolidated net revenues discussed above and the increases at the missouri properties are primarily attributed to a increase in operating income  excluding certain charges credits  at station casino kansas city due to a significant improvement in operations at this property

charles was reversed as the property posted a million increase in operating income  excluding certain charges credits

casino revenues increased for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  with increases at all of the company s properties 
the increase in casino revenues at the nevada operations is a result of the same factors affecting consolidated net revenues discussed above 
the growth in casino revenues in the second half of the year was tempered somewhat due to the competitive impact of the opening of the suncoast on texas station  continued road construction near palace station and competitive supply increases on the boulder strip and surrounding areas

food and beverage revenues decreased for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  despite the acquisition of santa fe station 
at the nevada operations  food and beverage revenues remained flat with the acquisition of santa fe station offsetting the reduction in food covers at the other nevada properties 
the reduction in food covers is due to a combination of selected menu price increases and additional competition in the market from restaurants in both gaming and non gaming facilities 
at the missouri operations  food and beverage revenues experienced a decrease primarily due to a decrease in food covers as a result of selected menu price increases at station casino kansas city and to an overall reduction of complimentaries at station casino st 
charles 
food and beverage net profit margin increased for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  due to an improvement at the nevada operations  primarily as a result of continued focus on cost control and purchasing efficiencies  as well as selected menu price increases 
the increase in margin at the nevada operations was offset by a decrease at station casino st 
charles 
food and beverage revenues for the fiscal year ended december  increased over food and beverage revenues for the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily due to the completion of the expansion projects at sunset station and texas station 
these increases in food and beverage revenues in nevada were offset by decreases at the missouri properties

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased in the fiscal year ended december  to million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the write down of assets at station casino st 
charles in the fourth quarter of and also due to the assets at station casino st 
charles and station casino kansas city not being depreciated during the last two months of the year 
upon entering into the agreement to sell the missouri properties  these assets were classified as assets held for sale and  consequently  depreciation ceased 
this decrease was offset by an increase at sunset station due to the purchase of various leased equipment in october and due to the acquisition of santa fe station 
depreciation and amortization increased million in the fiscal year ended december  to million as compared to million in the twelve months ended december  this increase is due to the completion of the expansion projects at sunset station and texas station which were completed in november and february  respectively

charles as a portion of the original equipment became fully depreciated during the fiscal year ended december   as both properties have been open for five years 
in addition  palace station had a large purchase of slot machines in that became fully depreciated during the fiscal year ended december  impairment loss 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company recorded an impairment loss of million in the fiscal year ended december  and million in the transition period to adjust the carrying value of its fixed assets and land held for development to their estimated fair value 
in the fiscal year ended december   approximately million of the impairment loss was related to station casino st 
charles 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made a decision to reconfigure the existing station casino st 
charles facility to a more efficient layout in response to the new open boarding rules promulgated by the missouri gaming commission that began in september in the st 
louis market 
in march  all gaming operations were moved to the existing barge and the existing riverboat has been sold 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the riverboat and miscellaneous other fixed assets were written down by approximately million to their net realizable value 
in addition  the company performed an evaluation of the carrying values of the remaining assets in st 
charles and determined a million write down of the asset values was necessary 
the write down was deemed appropriate after a review of the property s asset valuations relative to the company s near term investment objectives 
the balance of the impairment loss in the fiscal year ended december   resulted primarily from the company s determination that it would sell a acre parcel of land in henderson  nevada  that it had acquired 
future development of the property will be limited to non gaming purposes 
the resulting write down of the parcel was necessary to reflect the value of the land as a non gaming site 
this land was sold in the fiscal year ended december  in the transition period  the impairment loss principally involves assets at the station casino st 
charles facility  including a riverboat formerly used in the missouri operations  capitalized project costs associated with various parcels of land determined to have no value  and several parcels of land within close proximity to the st 
charles  missouri site that were being held for future development 
the fair value of the impaired assets was primarily determined through the market s interest in riverboats and barges  and on the comparable sales prices on parcels of land in the st 
charles area 
the total amount of the impairment loss in the transition period related to this category of assets was approximately million 
in addition to the assets described above  the most significant portion of the remaining impairment loss in the transition period relates to several parcels of land in nevada and texas that the company had acquired in the past for either defensive or expansion purposes 
the value of these parcels was determined based on sales prices for comparable parcels of land on the market 
the following two circumstances led to the company s decision to write down these assets to their fair market value the passage  in nevada  of legislation which places significantly higher requirements on land to be zoned for gaming purposes  and the termination of the plan of merger with crescent real estate equities
