this chair line is manufactured in house and is marketed under the swiftset trade name 
in the fall of  the company introduced a new line of lightweight  durable lecterns under the summit lectern trade name 
historically  mity lite s growth has come from an expanding base of new customers  from increasing sales to existing customers in this segment of the business and from broadening its product line 
the multipurpose room operation s current and future growth is largely dependent upon its ability to successfully introduce and market new product lines of multipurpose room furniture such as chairs  staging  flooring  partitions  risers and bench seating and its ability to continue increasing its market penetration into existing markets 
the company s healthcare seating operations were acquired in november the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of broda enterprises inc for million 
broda s products are marketed under the broda trade name 
its operations are based in waterloo  ontario  canada 
on april   the company acquired certain assets and obligations of the centercore group  inc  a privately owned designer  manufacturer and marketer of pod style and panel systems furniture marketed to call centers and other high density office use environments 
two wholly owned subsidiaries of mity enterprises completed the transactions 
c core  inc  a utah corporation  purchased the accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  intellectual property and certain other assets of the centercore group  inc  for approximately million 
c core designs and markets call center and panel systems furniture under the centercore name 
product manufacturing was consolidated with do group  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
as part of the centercore purchase  boccc  inc  also a utah corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the company  purchased the outstanding subordinated debt obligations of centercore for million 
the outstanding subordinated debt obligations of centercore totaled approximately million at closing 
cash from the company s general working capital was used to fund the purchases 
effective april   the company acquired the remaining percent equity interest in do group  inc making do group a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
do group  inc is a manufacturer of specialty office seating and office panel systems headquartered in elkhart  indiana 
do group markets its products under the domore  corel  jg and do trade names and has manufacturing facilities in elkhart  indiana  and marked tree  arkansas 
as an unconsolidated subsidiary  do group s total sales for the years ended march  and were  and  respectively

mity enterprises exchanged approximately million cash and  shares of mity enterprises common stock valued at  for the remaining percent of do group stock from the do group shareholders 
in addition  mity enterprises assumed approximately million in a revolving credit line 
the acquisition was treated for accounting purposes as a step purchase 
do group  inc is now a wholly owned subsidiary of mity enterprises  inc 
cash from the company s general working capital was used to fund the purchase 
the significant increases in accounts receivable and inventories as compared to pre acquisition levels are a direct result of this acquisition 
effective april   the company also created a new corporation called mli acquisition  inc which was later renamed mity lite  inc 
with the exception of cash  real property  certain deferred tax obligations  and investments in and notes receivable from subsidiaries  all of the assets and liabilities of mity enterprises were transferred to mity lite  inc mity lite  inc has become the operating company for the multipurpose furniture operations and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the centercore and do group subsidiaries  especially as it relates to their office systems operations located in marked tree  arkansas  have experienced various operational challenges 
material costs have increased as a percent of sales primarily because of outsourcing of component fabrication  increasing obsolescence reserves  increasing customer services costs  and lower material order quantities 
small component orders have been more expensive than large production runs might have been 
labor costs as a percentage of net sales have increased primarily because of operational inefficiencies  lower sales volumes  and increased customer service costs related to completing incomplete orders  replacing freight damaged products  and resolving customer complaints 
overhead costs have increased both as a percentage of sales and in the aggregate primarily because of lower sales volumes  higher freight costs and higher personnel costs resulting from these operational difficulties 
the average sales prices of the company s products have declined as a result of discounting on a few large orders and offering some limited customer service discounts 
in addition  the operation s management information systems have not yet been adequately implemented to fully support the operations 
the operational inefficiencies  information system problems  and their related costs have significantly and adversely impacted the company s gross margin and customer service levels 
as a result  the office systems operations have been expediting incoming materials and product shipments to customers  shipping orders late and sometimes incomplete  incurring additional warranty and customer services costs  and generally incurring additional costs as a result of the inefficiencies 
because of these problems  do group s and centercore s sales have declined and cumulative losses have grown 
during the quarter ended june   the company began the process of restructuring the do group and centercore management teams and implementing information system policies and controls which the company believes will better allow it to control and manage the operations 
the changes and improvements being made are ongoing and will likely continue for at least the next several months or until product lines are sold 
because of the problems described above  the company has lost some customer orders and its office systems sales base has deteriorated 
traditionally  the company has experienced strong order volume in its general service administration gsa or government market segment during its second and third fiscal quarters each year  especially from europe and asia 
during the six month period ended december   the company received orders totaling approximately million in the gsa markets 
during the six months ended december   gsa orders were less than million  with limited orders coming from europe and asia 
in addition  one of the company s major oem customers  which historically has purchased approximately million annually from the company  implemented product design changes 
these changes caused this customer to delay purchases until the design was complete 
this customer has recently approved the new design and has begun placing orders again with the company 
since acquiring and taking over the direct management of do group  the company has worked to identify and resolve operational and other problems 
the company has taken action to reduce the amount of losses being incurred at do group and centercore by reducing personnel costs through layoffs and implementing more sound business practices 
the company has devoted additional management as well as outside consulting resources to the resolution of these problems 
in spite of these cutbacks and other management initiatives  do group and centercore continue to sustain losses 
the changes and improvements being made in the do group and centercore subsidiaries are ongoing and will likely continue for at least the next several months or until product lines are sold 
the company cannot assure that management will be successful in turning around the office systems operations and restoring its related customer base 
in december  the company announced it was seeking a buyer for the centercore product line 
in february  the company announced that it had retained mcdonald investments  inc to investigate strategic alternatives for the company  including the sale of all or parts of the company 
with the assistance of mcdonald investments  the company continues to evaluate the possible sale of all or parts of the company  including centercore and do group 
the company may be unable to consummate a sale of such operations at a gain or at all 
if the company is unable to sell its centercore and do group operations and or is unable to make them profitable  it may have to discontinue these operations which would likely result in substantial costs to the company and a negative impact to its short term profitability

the company s liquidity is partially dependent upon the availability of its credit facility 
the company currently believes that cash flow from its current operations together with existing cash reserves and available lines of credit will be sufficient to support its working capital requirements for its existing operations for at least the next months 
however  the company s working capital requirements have significantly increased because of the do group acquisition  losses in the do group and centercore operations and the construction of a new manufacturing facility  and may further increase as a result of continuing losses in its do group and centercore subsidiaries and additional capital investment 
as a result of the operational challenges in the company s do group and centercore subsidiaries  the company may access the company s line of credit from time to time on a short term basis to meet cash flow requirements for the business as a whole 
no assurances are given as to the sufficiency of the company s working capital to support the company s operations particularly in light of current problems in the do group and centercore operations 
substantial investment of capital and management resources will be required regardless of the strategic alternatives explored or pursued by the company with respect to the centercore and do group operations including the company s efforts to sell these operations 
if the existing cash reserves  cash flow from operations and debt financing are insufficient or if working capital requirements are greater than currently estimated  the company could be required to raise additional capital 
there can be no assurance the company will be capable of raising additional capital or that the terms upon which such capital will be available to the company will be acceptable 
additional sources of equity capital are available to the company through the exercise by holders of outstanding options

there is no assurance that such options will be exercised 
the company s material cash commitments at march  consisted primarily of cash to be used to complete the purchase and installation of equipment at its orem location million and current liabilities of million both to be paid from funds generated from operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufacturers its products in the united states and canada and sells its products in those markets as well as in other countries 
most of the company s sales and expenses are transacted in us dollars with limited transactions occurring in canadian dollars or other foreign currencies 
for the year ended march   approximately percent of the company s net sales  percent of the company s cost of products sold  and percent of the company s operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company during fiscal the company generally does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
the company estimates that a percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates could have reduced operating profit by as much as  for the fiscal years ended march  and as mentioned above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility of other effects that may offset such adverse change
