the decrease in statutory surplus since is primarily due to dividends upstreamed to the holding company and lower operating results in and underwriting results the tables presented in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize the company s unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the two years in the period ended december   and the results of operations by line of business for each of the three years then ended 
the following discussion of underwriting results by line of business should be read in conjunction with the information presented in those tables 
personal auto 
automobile insurance is the primary line of business written by the company and historically has been profitable 
the majority of the company s insured autos are located in southern california 
the company continues to expand its coverage throughout the west by marketing its business in northern california  san diego county  nevada  oregon and washington 
vehicles in force were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted from actions taken to improve underwriting results discussed further below 
the increase in vehicles in force in was mainly from two factors it was the first full year of operations in nevada  oregon and washington  and california rates were reduced early in in a move that anticipated a continuation of favorable loss trends that failed to materialize 
the company s retention rate was approximately for and for both and gross premiums written were million in  million in and million in the increase in was due to rate increases that more than offset the decline in the number of insured vehicles 
the decrease in was caused mainly by rate decreases of effective february  and effective january   which more than offset the increase in the number of insured vehicles 
net premiums earned were million in  million in and million in the increase in is greater than the proportional increase in the corresponding gross premiums written because of the decrease from to in the quota share reinsurance arrangement with aig 
the decrease in follows the corresponding decrease in gross premiums written 
underwriting results were a loss of million in compared to underwriting profits of million in and million in the company had reduced its california rates by more than from to  and the rate decreases in and in particular had anticipated the continuation of favorable loss trends that failed to materialize 
the resultant under pricing caused the loss and lae ratio to grow steadily from in to in  with the higher than anticipated losses first becoming evident in the third quarter of corrective measures taken in included increasing auto rates by in california  in arizona  in oregon and in washington  with a rate increase still pending in nevada 
an additional rate increase was filed for in california subsequent to december  the underwriting expense ratio for the auto line of business was in  in and in the increase in the ratio for was mainly caused by increases in occupancy costs  data processing and depreciation expense that more than offset the decrease in advertising expense 
the increase in the ratio for primarily resulted from the rate decrease taken in february and increased advertising expense 
other personal lines 
policies in force were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
the increase in was caused mainly by having twelve months of new sales of homeowners policies  which resumed in september the change from to was principally due the effects of a rate decrease taken in july and a return to more normal attrition rates following the resumption of new sales 
in addition  the ratio of pup policies to vehicles in force increased slightly from to gross premiums written were million in  million in and million in the increase in was due to inclusion of new policy sales in the homeowners line for a full year since they resumed in september of net premiums earned and underwriting results for and are not comparable to because of the termination effective january   of the quota share reinsurance arrangements that previously had been in place since mid earthquake 
aside from an insignificant amount of premium assumed from the california fair plan prior to inception of the california earthquake authority in  the company has not written any earthquake coverage since but continues to be exposed to possible adverse development stemming from the northridge earthquake 
earthquake losses and expenses totaled million in  million in and million in as noted under item business  earthquake losses and loss adjustment expenses may be adversely impacted in and perhaps future years by sb and the ultimate resolution of certain earthquake claims currently in litigation 
investment income total pre tax investment income  excluding equity in the net loss of st of arizona and before deducting investment expenses  was million in compared to million in and million in average invested assets decreased in compared to increase of in and in average invested assets decreased in compared to primarily due to the net sale of investments to cover the payoff of the bank loan of million  acquisitions of property and equipment  and dividends to stockholders 
the increase in invested assets in was primarily due to million of proceeds received from the exercise of aig s common stock warrants in the third quarter of the average annual pre tax yield on invested assets was in  in and in the average annual after tax yield on invested assets was in  in and in net realized losses on the sale of investments were million in and million in compared to net capital gains of million for the increase in realized gains is primarily due to the company s decision to begin switching its investment portfolio from taxable to non taxable securities during in anticipation of fully utilizing its remaining net operating loss carryforward and selling in a favorable bond market 
at december   million of the company s total investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt bonds with the balance  representing of the portfolio  invested in taxable securities compared to at december  as of december   the company had a pre tax net unrealized gain on fixed maturity investments of million compared to a net unrealized loss of million in and a net unrealized gain of million in interest rates fell in and  which increased the fair value of the bond portfolio in those years 
conversely  interest rates rose in  which decreased the fair value of the bond portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources premiums and investment income represent the company s major sources of cash  while loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash out flows 
the company continually monitors loss payments to provide projections of future cash requirements 
additional cash requirements include the cost of investing in new technology  dividends to stockholders and  in  the payoff of the bank loan of million 
funds required by the company to pay dividends are provided by the insurance subsidiaries 
the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company is regulated by state law 
based upon operating results and earned surplus as of december   the company believes it will not require regulatory approval in for any extraordinary dividends 
in  the company embarked on a major project to upgrade its technological infrastructure and to conform certain of its operational procedures to industry best practices 
although the ultimate cost of this project is expected to be about million to be paid through the end of  management believes cash flow from operations as well as expected improvements in operational efficiencies will be more than adequate to fund the project s implementation which is expected to be completed over the next several years 
during the second quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized and spent million to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
as of april    shares had been repurchased 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners requires property and casualty insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk based capital rbc formula in their annual statements 
the rbc requirements are intended to assist regulators in identifying inadequately capitalized companies 
the rbc calculation is based on the type and mix of risks inherent in the company s business and includes components for underwriting  asset  interest rate and other risks 
to the extent that a subsidiary s surplus fell below prescribed levels  it would be the parent company s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity 
the company s insurance subsidiaries exceeded their rbc statutory surplus standards by a considerable margin as of december  forward looking statements the company s management has made in this report  and from time to time may make in its public filings  press releases  and oral presentations and discussions  forward looking statements concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in addition to market risk  the company is exposed to other risks  including the credit risk related to its financial instruments and the underlying insurance risk related to its core business 
the first column in the following table shows the financial statement carrying values of the company s financial instruments 
the company s investment portfolio is carried at fair value 
the second column shows the effect on current carrying values and estimated fair values assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates and a decline in equity prices 
the following sensitivity analysis summarizes only the exposure to market risk as of december  estimated fair value at adjusted market rates prices as carrying value indicated below amounts in millions interest rate risk fixed maturities available for sale equity price risk marketable equity securities adjusted interest rates assume a basis point increase in market rates at december  adjusted equity prices assume a percent decline in values at december because the company historically has generated an underwriting profit  its cash flow from operations and short term cash position generally is more than sufficient to meet its obligations for claim payments  which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business tend to have an average duration of less than a year 
as a result  the company generally has the ability to hold its investments to maturity  and it has been unnecessary for the company to employ elaborate market risk management techniques involving complicated asset and liability duration matching or hedging strategies 
for all its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversification 
financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of the company s financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the analysis 
this analysis is further limited as it does not consider any actions the company could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices
