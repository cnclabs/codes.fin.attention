for financial information by geographic segment  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue we generate revenue primarily by providing executive search and leadership consulting services to our clients 
our executive search revenue growth is largely a function of increasing the revenue per consultant and the number of consultants employed based on number of months employed during the period 
average revenue per executive search consultant is a function of the number of searches performed per consultant and the fee earned per search 
revenue largely consists of fees earned from our executive search business and indirect expenses  as well as fees earned from leadersonline  management assessment  and placement of interim executive management 
revenue from client services is recognized when such services are earned and realizable 
revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our services equal to approximately one third of the estimated guaranteed first year compensation for the position to be filled 
in addition  if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we often will be authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search 
we generally bill our clients for our retainer and indirect expenses in one third increments over a three month period commencing in the month of the acceptance of the contract by our client 
for each executive search assignment  we and our client enter into a contract  which outlines the general terms and conditions of the assignment 
we receive warrants for equity securities in our client companies  in addition to our cash fee  for services rendered on some searches 
when the warrants are received  revenue is recorded equal to the estimated fair market value of the investment received 
hiring new executive search consultants requires a large initial investment in signing bonuses  guaranteed bonuses  and salaries and benefits for associated support staff and does not tend to immediately provide proportionately higher revenues 
as a result of new hires  our average revenue per consultant and overall profitability are typically negatively affected in the short term 
operating expenses our operating expenses are divided into two general categories salaries and employee benefits  and general and administrative expenses 
salaries and employee benefits 
the largest components of our operating expenses are compensation and benefits paid to consultants  executive officers  and administrative and support personnel  of which the most significant elements are salaries and annual bonuses 
other items included in this category are signing bonuses and guaranteed bonuses often incurred in connection with the hiring of new executive search consultants  payroll taxes  profit sharing and retirement benefits  and employee insurance benefits 
an executive search consultant s base salary represents  on average  less than one half of the consultant s total annual compensation  which is performance based and derived from origination and execution credits 
typically  a portion of the credit for a particular assignment goes to the consultants who originate the assignment  and a portion goes to the consultants who perform the assignment 
in addition  a portion of each consultant s annual compensation is based on management s assessment of that consultant s partnership and work quality 
at leadersonline  our econsultant s base salary represents  on average  more than one half of the econsultant s total annual compensation 
general and administrative expenses 
the key components of general and administrative expenses include rent  information systems costs  general office expenses and professional service costs including legal  accounting and third party professional services 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include depreciation  amortization and bad debt expense 
nonrecurring charges in the third quarter of  we decided to retain proprietary control of leadersonline and its internet enhanced recruiting methods

accordingly  we recorded nonrecurring charges in the third quarter  including a non cash compensation charge of million  which represents the remainder of a million non cash compensation charge related to the issuance of options by leadersonline at a price below the deemed fair market value for accounting purposes at the time of issuance 
the difference of million was recorded as a recurring charge over the first three quarters of the resulting amount of million was recorded to additional paid in capital

during the first quarter of  we incurred a nonrecurring charge of million 
this charge was the result of our agreement to modify the terms of the mulder partner gmbh co 
kg mulder acquisition agreement  including the termination of all employment contingencies 
hsi acquired of mulder on october   for a combination of cash and  shares of hsi common stock 
on october   hsi delivered  shares of hsi common stock  paid million to the partners of mulder and incurred  of associated transaction costs 
under the original mulder acquisition agreement an additional million plus interest at an annual rate of was due to the partners of mulder in five equal annual installments  the first of which was paid on october  the remaining shares were to be issued in four annual installments beginning january  because the total purchase price was contingent upon the continued employment of the mulder consultants  the cost of the acquisition was accounted for as compensation expense to be recognized over a five year period beginning october  in connection with the merger  the mulder acquisition agreement was amended such that the remaining cash plus interest would be paid within days of the completion of the merger and  shares reflecting a split of for of our common stock which were valued  based upon the estimated fair market value of our company  at million were issued to the mulder partners immediately after the merger 
during  we paid the remaining million cash due  issued  shares of our common stock and wrote off million of deferred compensation assets resulting in a total compensation charge of million 
in  we incurred nonrecurring compensation charges of million arising from the difference between the issuance price of shares issued by us in december and the fair market value of such shares at the date of grant  and million arising from the early settlement of profit sharing arrangements relating to the acquisition of certain latin american locations 
non operating income expense non operating income expense consists of interest income  interest expense  realized gains from the sale of equity securities  net of consultants bonuses and administrative and other costs  and other income and expenses

realized net gains from the sale of equity securities from our warrant program are recorded in other income 
equity in net income loss of affiliate prior to the merger  we held a significant interest in hsi 
equity in net income loss of affiliate relates to the income earned or loss incurred from our investment in hsi after giving effect to currency translation adjustments 
taxes we are subject to us federal  state and us income taxes 
income generated outside of the united states may be subject to higher tax rates than us income 
as a result  our effective tax rate may be higher than prevailing us tax rates 
historically  certain non deductible expenses have increased our effective tax rate 
our provision for income taxes reflects our best judgment as to the likely effective tax rate for a given period
