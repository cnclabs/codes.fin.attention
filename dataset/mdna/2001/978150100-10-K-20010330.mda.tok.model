this agreement requires us to achieve minimum performance levels to receive compensation or to prevent contract termination 
we amended the agreement effective april  to reduce the minimum performance levels 
this amendment did not significantly improve the revenue opportunities under this arrangement  and we have notified bristol myers squibb of our intention to cancel the agreement effective march  for the year ending december   we recognized revenue of million for our co promotion of pravachol r

in  all revenues were from ortho est r tablets 
cost of sales for ortho est r tablets were fixed in all years under terms of a distribution agreement with ortho mcneil pharmaceutical whereby we made scheduled payments regardless of sales volume 
our gross margin was earned by generating revenue in excess of these fixed payments 
cost of sales of esclim tm fluctuate in a narrow range around of revenues 
there are no cost of sales associated with ortho prefest r and ortho tri cyclen r revenues 
operating expenses  which include marketing and sales and research and development expenses  increased million in from primarily as a result of the build up in sales force begun in late through mid year required by the ortho prefest r co promotion agreement 
that agreement  which was revised in september  required us to maintain a sales force of to support the launch of orth prefest r 
in june we reduced the sales force by approximately 
the increase in this category from to is the result of comparing only a half year of sales activity and one product ortho est r tablets in to a full year s activity in and four products ortho est r tablets  pravachol r  ortho tri cyclen r and esclim tm 
we currently maintain a sales force of specialists 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses and consulting services in the area of regulatory compliance

operating expenses  which include marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses  consist of catalog production and mailing costs  call center and fulfillment expenses  as well as purchasing and marketing expenses

factors affecting results of operations we incurred losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and respectively 
due to our short operating history  our revenues have varied and have been difficult to forecast on a quarterly or annual basis 
however  many of our expenses are fixed  especially in the short term 
in addition  we are an early stage company that has incurred significant operating expenses associated with obtaining rights to market and distribute products  the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts and general and administrative activities 
in june we took steps to reduce expenses by eliminating certain corporate overhead and  in recognition of lower than expected revenues  reduced our sales force by almost 
we expect continued variability in revenues as we realign our product mix as a result of ending our co promotion of ortho prefest r 
because of these factors  our results of operations have varied during our short operating history  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate  perhaps significantly  in the future 
in addition  other factors may cause fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations in the future  including the following the success or failure of our sales force in distributing our current product line and changes in market acceptance of those products  our success or failure in executing under our asset transfer and supply agreement  our ability to acquire new products  legislative changes that affect our products and the way we market them and our ability to comply with new or existing regulations  the amount and timing of expenditures for the expansion of our operations  the timing and growth of our consumer division  changes in the competitive environment that could cause us to change our pricing or marketing strategy  the effects our limited capital and needs for additional capital may have on our ability to meet the objectives we have set for our business  and changes in the economic and market environment generally or in the health care industry 
to the extent our revenues do not cover our expenses  we may be unable to reduce spending commitments in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall and may experience significant unanticipated losses 
as a result of these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet the expectations of investors 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our working capital was million compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at year end in our short history we have had two primary sources of liquidity revenues from product sales and educational grants and proceeds from private placements of our equity securities and the initial public offering of common stock

we issued an additional  shares of common stock in april based on the operating results of as we change  llc 
while we intend to continue pursuing the potential addition of a product or the acquisition of a product line  we currently have no firm commitments 
in july  we entered into a distribution and license agreement with laboratoires fournier sa under which we have the exclusive right subject to exceptions to market  use  distribute and sell the esclim tm estradiol transdermal system in various dosages in the united states and puerto rico 
the agreement requires us to pay fournier a non refundable license fee of million payable over a two year period  of which million was paid in the payment due in has been deferred 
the remaining million is due in we have experienced a substantial increase in our expenditures since our inception  consistent with growth in our operations and staffing 
we are continuing the process we started in june to align costs and revenues 
without significant revenue growth  we do not expect growth of expenditures to continue 
we have terminated the co promotion agreement with ortho mcneil pharmaceutical that required us to expand our field sales organization to at least representatives in and to commit at least sales representatives in to co promote ortho prefest r 
we were obligated to make significant minimum payments under the distribution agreement for ortho est r tablets 
that agreement has been revised and we are no longer required to make fixed minimum payments 
beginning in  we will only pay contracted transfer prices for product manufactured by ortho mcneil pharmaceutical 
in  we made purchases of million under this agreement 
we believe that based on our current performance and future plans  our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures and meet our minimum purchase commitments through at least the end of fiscal thereafter  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities 
we currently do not have any lines of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot give you any assurances that we will be able to raise any such capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to women first or at all 
the extent of our needs for additional liquidity will depend on our future operating performance  which is itself dependent on a number of factors  many of which we cannot control  including prevailing economic conditions  availability of other sources of liquidity  and financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting our business and operations
