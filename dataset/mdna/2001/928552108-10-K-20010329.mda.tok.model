item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the financial statements and the related notes referenced elsewhere in this report 
company overview we are a provider of comprehensive interconnect solutions for use in storage area networks  or sans 
our portfolio of fibre channel products  including our san management software  fabric switches  arbitrated loop hubs and transceivers  is fully interoperable and designed to perform in concert to address a wide variety of data and storage needs 
we incorporated in colorado in june under the name photonics research incorporated and initially developed fiber optic components for data communications and related applications 
in february  we reincorporated in delaware and changed our name to vixel corporation 
in the first quarter of  we acquired the fibre channel hub and transceiver product lines from western digital corporation 
in we began developing our san insite software to manage our san interconnect solutions 
in the first quarter of  we acquired arcxel technologies  inc  a developer of fibre channel switches 
in early  we sold our laser diode fabrication facility and gigabit ethernet transceiver product line to cielo communications  inc  and have since been focused exclusively on designing  developing and marketing our fibre channel san interconnect solutions 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of san interconnect products  including switches  hubs and transceivers 
we currently include our san insite software with our switches and managed hubs and do not sell this software separately from our other products 
however  we are in the latter stages of developing a version of our san insite software that we intend to license for a fee in the future 
san systems revenue consists of revenue generated from our san switches  hubs and transceiver products sold as a result of selling our switches and hubs 
component revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from the sale of our transceiver products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  for use in their products 
we sell our products primarily to a limited number of original equipment manufacturers 
compaq computer and sun microsystems represented and of revenue  respectively  for fiscal during  compaq computer and sun microsystems represented and of revenue  respectively 
no other individual customer represented more than of our total revenue in those periods 
while we are seeking to diversify our customer base and expand the portion of our revenue that is derived from sales through various distribution channels  we anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on volume sales to a relatively small number of oems 
we may not be successful in our efforts to diversify our customer base and the loss of one of our key customers could significantly reduce our total revenue 
during fiscal and  and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from sales to distribution channel customers 
we plan to expand our sales channels to include systems integrators  vars and additional distributors in the united states and internationally 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of product shipment  unless we have future obligations for installation or when we ship product demonstration units 
revenue from products shipped with future installation obligations is recognized when we meet our future obligation 
revenue is not recognized on demonstration units unless the customer ultimately purchases the unit  and the related revenue is recognized at that time 
our agreement with our north american distributors provides for price protection and for stock rotation based on a percentage of shipments for the preceding quarter when an offsetting order is requested 
revenue for the percentage of shipments subject to these stock rotation rights is deferred until the stock rotation period has passed 
we provide an allowance for price protection rights 
we also maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on a combination of historical experience and specifically identified potential warranty liabilities 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue is affected by the mix of products sold  sales channels and customers to which our products are sold 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue also is affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes and component costs  manufacturing costs charged by our contract manufacturer  new product introductions  changes in our product pricing and estimated warranty costs 
we expect that average unit selling prices for our products will decline over time in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
we seek to maintain gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by selling a higher percentage of higher margin products and reducing the cost of our products through manufacturing efficiencies  design improvements and cost reductions for components 
since september  we have outsourced our product manufacturing to one contract manufacturer  k tec electronics  a division of thayer blum funding ii llc 
k tec also provides distribution and repair operations and most of our materials management 
we purchase certain components directly from suppliers and resell them to k tec at our cost and recognize no revenue from these transactions 
we also outsource the manufacturing of our asics to third party manufacturers that ship these components to k tec for assembly 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants during  we recorded stock based compensation of million 
stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity 
the balance is expensed on a graded vesting method over the vesting period of the options 
during fiscal and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of the stock based compensation as compensation expense 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had operating loss carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes 
these operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the gross deferred tax asset balance because our accumulated deficit  history of recurring net losses and possible limitations on the use of carryforwards give rise to uncertainty as to whether the deferred tax assets are realizable 
further  these operating loss carryforwards could be subject to usage limitations due to changes in our ownership resulting from equity financings 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
we also expect to incur significant product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
we cannot be certain that we will ever realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
acquisitions and divestitures in february  we acquired arcxel technologies  inc for a total purchase price of million 
arcxel was a developer of fibre channel switches for the san market 
we acquired this switch company to obtain products and technology to expand our total san interconnect portfolio of products to include management software  switches  managed hubs  entry level hubs and transceiver products 
at the time of the acquisition  arcxel had just introduced its first product  a fibre channel switch 
also at the time of the arcxel acquisition  in process development projects included an asic  a fabric switch and a switching hub 
both the fabric switch and the switching hub were being designed to use the in process asic  which was the key technology being developed by arcxel 
of the total value of the acquired in process technology  approximately was associated with the asic which was estimated to be complete at the time of the acquisition  approximately was associated with the fabric switch which was estimated to be complete and approximately was associated with the switching hub which was estimated to be complete 
the value of the in process technology related to each of these projects was determined by estimating the future net cash flows resulting from products anticipated to result from these projects and discounting the net cash flows to the date of acquisition using a discount rate of 
since this acquisition  we completed the development of the asic and the fabric switch  which became our vixel product 
the vixel began generating revenue in the quarter ended july  also  subsequent to the acquisition  we decided not to complete the development of the switching hub that was in process  rather we are devoting our resources to developing other fabric switches that will use the asic that was in development at the time of the acquisition 
in february  we sold substantially all of our laser diode fabrication laboratory and gigabit ethernet transceiver product line  which was located in colorado 
we received cash proceeds of million and the acquirer assumed the net liabilities associated with the operations 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a gain of approximately million in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of revenue  statement of operations data for the periods indicated for the fiscal year ended january  january  december  revenue san systems components total revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development acquired in process technology selling  general and administrative amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net net loss fiscal years ended january   january  and december  revenue 
total revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our san systems revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in san systems revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal was the result of increased sales of each of our switch and hub products available in the increase in san systems revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal was the result of increased sales of our switch products 
component and other revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
performance issues with our cd based transceiver products sold primarily in were identified in late and early and resulted in decreased purchases of our transceiver products in fiscal as compared with fiscal these performance issues combined with certain other warranty issues with our glm transceiver products resulted in a further decrease in the purchases of our component products in fiscal as compared with fiscal we anticipate that our component revenue will continue to decrease as a result of our decision to focus our resources on the development  sales and marketing of our san systems products  as well as a result of some of our customers perceptions of our transceiver performance problems 
gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the cost to acquire finished products from our third party manufacturer of our products  expenses we incur related to inventory management  product quality testing and customer order fulfillment  and provisions for warranty expenses and inventory obsolescence 
gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increases in both absolute dollars and percentage of total revenue in as compared with  and as compared with  reflect a change in our product mix  as sales of switch and hub products increased while sales of transceivers declined 
our switch and hub products generally have higher gross margins than our transceiver products 
in addition  fiscal gross profit was negatively affected as a result of recording a million warranty provision for our gbic transceivers and a writedown in the fourth quarter of fiscal of developed technologies capitalized as part of our purchase of arcxel technologies 
the increase in our warranty provisions in fiscal related to the estimated costs to repair or replace those transceiver products that contain lasers that are showing signs of faster deterioration than we historically have experienced 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development and sustaining engineering of our products  consulting and outside service fees  costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was due to increased development costs relating to our management software  switch and managed hub products 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was due to increased development costs relating to our management software and switch products and to two development agreements with third parties to embed our switch or asic technology into their products 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is an essential element of our strategic objectives to design quality products while reducing costs and to leverage our technologies into new market opportunities 
as a result  we expect these expenses to increase in the future 
acquired in process technology 
acquired in process technology expenses in fiscal related to our acquisition of arcxel technologies in february this acquired in process technology was identified and valued by an independent third party at million  of the total purchase price  and was expensed immediately 
the value of acquired in process technology was determined by estimating future net cash flows resulting from products anticipated to result from the in process projects and discounting the net cash flows to the date of acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales  finance and information technology support functions  as well as professional fees  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  trade shows and other marketing activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal is the result of expenses we recognized in fiscal in connection with our defense and settlement of certain patent lawsuits 
the increase in the selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to increases in sales and customer service and support personnel in amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of total revenue 
the decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily the result of a writeoff in fiscal of goodwill associated with capitalized developed technology written down in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared with fiscal is the result of an increase in the amortization of the intangible assets capitalized in conjunction with our purchase of arcxel technologies in february amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation in fiscal and was million and million  respectively  as a result of stock options granted to employees and consultants during fiscal for which we recorded stock based compensation of million 
we incurred no amortization of stock based compensation in fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  consists of the gain or loss on the sale of business divisions or product lines  interest income  interest expense and other miscellaneous income or expense 
other income  net  was million in fiscal  other expense  net  was  in fiscal and other income  net was million in fiscal other income in fiscal included a one time million gain on the sale of our laser diode fabrication laboratory and gigabit ethernet transceiver product line 
other expense  net in fiscal was primarily interest expense 
other income  net in was primarily interest income relating to our short term investments 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock and preferred stock with aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  we have financed our operations through capital equipment lease lines  working capital credit facilities  notes payable and million in net cash received from the sale of our laser diode fabrication facility and gigabit ethernet product line 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
cash utilized by operating activities was million in fiscal  due to net losses  as well as working capital required to fund our operations 
cash provided by investing activities was million  primarily related to maturities of short term investments  net purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures of million 
cash used in financing activities was million  primarily due to payments on our capital leases and net proceeds from common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our future revenue  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales  general and administrative activities  the timing of introductions of new products  and market acceptance of our products 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all

factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we have incurred significant losses since our inception  we expect future losses  and we may not become profitable 
we have incurred significant losses since inception  most recently a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended december   and expect to incur losses in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot be certain that we ever will realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
we expect to incur significant product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses  and we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
our operating results are difficult to forecast  may fluctuate on a quarterly basis and may be adversely affected by many factors  which may result in volatility in our stock price 
our revenue and results of operations have varied on a quarterly basis in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
some of the factors that could affect our operating results include the size  terms and fluctuations of customer orders  particularly orders from a limited number of original equipment manufacturers  or oems  changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in the computer storage and networking industries  such as a change in spending levels for information technology products  the timing of customer orders  a large percentage of which are generated in the last month of the quarter  our ability to attain and maintain sufficient reliability levels for our san interconnect products  our ability to develop and market new products  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of products by us  our oems and our competitors  decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products  the mix of products sold  as our switches and hubs typically have higher margins than our transceivers  and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  and the ability of our contract manufacturer to produce and distribute our products in a timely fashion 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below our guidance  your expectations or the expectations of public market analysts 
our oems have unpredictable order patterns  which may cause our revenue to vary significantly from period to period 
our oems tend to order sporadically  and their purchases can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our oems generally forecast expected purchases in advance  but frequently do not order as expected and tend to place purchase orders only shortly before the scheduled delivery date 
we plan our operating expenses based in part on revenue projections derived from our oems forecasts 
because most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue 
these order habits cause our backlog to fluctuate significantly 
moreover  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period  as orders are subject to cancellation or delay by our oems with limited or no penalty 
the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenue 
our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant oems and resellers  as well as on the sales efforts and success of these customers 
compaq computer and sun microsystems represented and of our total revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  although we are attempting to expand our base of oems and resellers  most of our future revenue may come from a small number of customers 
our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales to those customers 
for example our oem and reseller agreements are not exclusive and contain no renewal obligation  our oems and resellers can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time  and our oem and reseller agreements do not require minimum purchases 
we cannot be certain that we will retain our current oems and resellers or that we will be able to recruit additional or replacement customers 
many of our oems and resellers carry or utilize competing product lines 
if we were to lose one or more oems or resellers to a competitor  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be significantly harmed 
our success is dependent upon acceptance of fibre channel technology and the growth of the emerging san market 
our san insite management software  switches  hubs and transceivers are used exclusively in sans 
accordingly  widespread adoption of sans is critical to our future success 
the market for sans and related software  switches  hubs and transceivers is evolving rapidly and it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate 
our success in generating revenue in this emerging san market will depend on  among other things  our ability to demonstrate the benefits of sans and our san insite management software  switch  hub and transceiver products to oems  resellers and end users  enhance our existing products and to introduce new products on a timely basis to meet changes in customer preferences and evolving industry standards  develop  maintain and build relationships with leading oems and resellers  and accurately predict the direction of industry standards and base our products on those industry standards 
our failure to do any of these activities would adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in the emerging san market 
competing technologies may emerge and we may fail to adopt new technologies on a timely basis 
failure to utilize new technologies may decrease the demand for our products 
emerging technologies  such as ethernet ip and scsi over ip  have been discussed as competing alternatives to sans 
if we are unable to identify new technologies in a timely manner and efficiently utilize such new technologies in our product development efforts  the demand for our current products may decrease significantly and rapidly  which would harm our business 
we expect that a growing percentage of our future revenue will be derived from our switch and managed hub products  our san management software products  and royalties from technology development agreements with customers  and our success will depend on widespread acceptance of these products and technologies 
our future success depends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing high quality  cost effective products as well as product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
if we do not successfully develop  introduce and market new products  especially our switch and managed hub products  our revenue may decline 
we expect to launch new products and upgrades to existing products  including our gigabit fibre channel switches and our san insite management software upgrade 
our future revenue growth will depend on the success of our upgrades and new product launches and product launches by customers for which we are developing products under technology development agreements and the success of our current switch and managed hub products 
in addition  as we introduce new or enhanced products  we will have to manage successfully the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in our customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet our customers demands 
to the extent customers defer or cancel orders in expectation of new product releases  any delay in development or introduction of new products could cause our operating results to suffer 
because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales of entry level hubs and transceivers  we are dependent on continued widespread market acceptance of these products 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales of our entry level hubs and transceivers 
although we anticipate our revenue from these products will decline in the future as we focus on the development of san system products and as management of san products becomes more important in larger  more complex san implementations  we expect that revenue from our entry level hubs and transceivers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
if the market does not continue to accept our entry level hubs and transceivers  or if our revenue from these products decreases more rapidly than we anticipate  our total revenue will decline significantly 
competition in our markets may lead to reduced prices and sales of our products  increased losses and reduced market share 
the markets for san interconnect products are highly competitive 
our current competitors include a number of domestic and international companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
we expect that more companies  including our customers  may enter the market for san interconnect products 
we may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors 
increased competition could result in significant price erosion  reduced revenue  lower margins or loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for switch sales  we compete primarily with brocade communications  mcdata corporation and qlogic corporation 
for hub sales  we compete primarily with emulex corporation and gadzoox networks 
for transceiver sales  we compete primarily with finisar corporation  hewlett packard and ibm 
although we do not believe that any of the above competitors offer comprehensive san interconnect management software that directly competes with ours  other vendors  such as brocade and gadzoox  provide single point device managers for either switch or hub products  but not across multiple interconnect devices  including switches  hubs and transceivers 
we are currently developing a version of our san insite management software to manage third party devices within the san interconnect 
other software vendors  such as veritas software  sannavigator  inc  and prisa networks  have introduced or have under development products that may compete with our product when it is released 
our competitors continue to introduce improved products with lower prices  and we will have to do the same to remain competitive 
furthermore  larger companies in other related industries or our customers may develop or acquire technologies and apply their significant resources  including their distribution channels and brand recognition  to capture significant san market share 
therefore  we may not be able to compete successfully in the san market 
our failure to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis could cause our revenue to fall 
given the product life cycles in the markets for our products  any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could significantly harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
during  we expect to complete development of our new gigabit fibre channel switch  our loop switch on a chip asic  a fibre channel switch module for lucent technology s optistar edge switch  and a version of our san insite management software that will manage third party products in the san 
we may not be able to develop  manufacture and market these new products or other product enhancements in a timely manner or that achieve market acceptance 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements  or to license these technologies from third parties 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing oem product specifications  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with independent contractors or development partners  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses and devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated or at all 
oems and resellers typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they begin to market and sell new solutions that include our products 
this evaluation process is lengthy and may range from six months to one year or more 
this process is complex and may require significant sales  marketing and management efforts on our part 
this process becomes more complex as we simultaneously qualify our products with multiple customers 
as a result  we may expend significant resources to develop customer relationships before we recognize any revenue from these relationships or we may never realize any revenue from these efforts 
failure to manage our oem and reseller relationships and expand our distribution channels could significantly reduce our revenue 
we rely on oems and resellers to distribute and sell our products 
our success depends substantially on our ability to initiate  manage and expand our relationships with oems  our ability to attract additional resellers and the sales efforts of these oems and resellers 
our failure to manage and expand our relationships with oems and resellers  or their failure to market our products effectively  could substantially reduce our revenue and seriously harm our business 
any failure by us to successfully execute our distribution strategy will negatively impact our revenue 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding indirect distribution channels through oems and resellers  as well as expanding our field sales organization 
our failure to execute this strategy successfully could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
furthermore  as we expand our sales to resellers  we may increase our selling costs  as these parties generally require a higher level of customer support than our oems 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
many of our resellers also sell products that compete with our products 
we cannot assure you that our resellers will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
our failure to successfully develop or manage our reseller relationships or their failure to sell our products could reduce our revenue 
to support and develop opportunities for our indirect distribution channels  we have recently expanded and may further expand in the future our field sales and support staffing levels 
we cannot assure you that the cost of this expansion will not exceed the incremental revenue generated or that our expanded field sales and support staff will be able to compete successfully against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential competitors 
our inability to effectively establish our distribution channels or manage the expansion of our field sales and support staff would have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase revenue 
the loss of k tec  the failure to forecast accurately demand for our products or to manage successfully our relationship with k tec would negatively affect our business 
we rely on k tec electronics  an outside contract manufacturing firm  to manufacture  store and ship our products 
we share k tec s manufacturing capacity with numerous companies whose manufacturing needs may conflict with ours 
if k tec is unable or unwilling to complete production runs for us in the future  or experiences any significant delays in completing production runs or shipping our products  the manufacturing and sale of our products would be temporarily suspended 
we have in the past experienced delivery problems based on capacity constraints for production  test and material supply 
if our product volume requirements increase  we may find it necessary to augment our manufacturing capacity by exploring new subcontract manufacturers 
we may not be successful in finding qualified manufacturers that meet our needs 
an interruption in supply of our products  or additional costs incurred to qualify and shift production to an alternative manufacturing facility  would significantly harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
on october   kent electronics announced that it had sold k tec electronics to thayer blum funding ii llc 
k tec electronics has assured us that the sale will not affect its ability to meet our manufacturing needs 
however  we cannot be certain that k tec will continue to operate in the same manner as before the sale or be able to meet our manufacturing requirements without additional cost  or at all 
k tec is not obligated to supply products for us  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order that k tec has accepted 
we place purchase orders with k tec based on periodic forecasts 
while most of the materials used in our products are standard products  some are proprietary and or sole source and require extended lead times 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products and manufacturing capacity or if materials are not available at k tec to meet the demand 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly and depend on the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we also may experience shortages of components from time to time  which could delay the manufacture of our products 
we plan to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we coordinate our efforts with k tec to rapidly achieve volume production 
if we do not effectively manage our relationship with k tec  or if k tec experiences delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
if we are required to or choose to change contract manufacturers  we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
we may lose sales if our sole source suppliers fail to meet our needs 
we currently purchase several key components from single sources 
we depend on single sources for our card guides  our vcsels  our application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and our microprocessors 
vcsels are laser components that maintain a high quality signal and consume a low amount of power 
asics are custom designed computer chips that perform specific functions very efficiently 
in addition  we license software from a third party that is incorporated into our switches and hubs 
if we cannot supply products due to a lack of components  or are unable to redesign products with other components in a timely manner  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for particular components 
as a result  our component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
undetected software or hardware defects could increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
san interconnect products and management software frequently contain undetected software or hardware defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products are complex and problems may be found from time to time in our existing  new or enhanced products 
our products incorporate components manufactured by third parties 
we have in the past experienced difficulties with quality and reliability of components obtained from third parties and we could experience similar problems in the future 
in addition  our products are integrated with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
a component in our transceivers has experienced an abnormally high failure rate  which has adversely affected and could in the future affect our sales 
we observed  and some customers confirmed  that in certain applications our gbic and glm transceivers manufactured prior to march that incorporated a third party cd laser experienced an abnormally high failure rate 
we no longer use the laser as a result of this problem  we recorded a warranty reserve of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal although we have settled claims by customers that purchased the majority of these products  there is a risk that additional claims could occur and that the total amount reserved may be inadequate to cover all potential claims 
claims against us in excess of the amount of our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
partially as a result of this problem  sun microsystems and hewlett packard stopped purchasing our transceiver products and we have seen our component revenue decrease from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal we anticipate that revenue from our component gbic and glm transceivers will continue to decrease as we have decided to focus our resources on our san systems products 
if we fail to successfully develop the vixel brand  our revenue may not grow and our stock price may fall 
we believe that establishing and maintaining the vixel brand is a critical aspect of our efforts to maintain and develop strategic oem and reseller relationships  and that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the growing number of vendors of san interconnect products 
if we fail to promote our brand successfully  or if we incur excessive expenses in an attempt to promote and maintain the vixel brand  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if our oems  resellers and end users of our san interconnect products do not perceive our products to be of high quality  or if we introduce new products or technologies that are not accepted by the market  the value of the vixel brand will decline and our business will suffer 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire and integrate qualified personnel  we may not be successful 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued joint contributions of our senior management  including james m 
mccluney  president and chief executive officer  kurtis l 
adams  chief financial officer  thomas hughes  vice president  product development and stuart b 
berman  chief technology officer 
the loss of one or more of our senior management personnel could harm our sales or delay our product development efforts 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  technical  sales and marketing  finance and operations personnel 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel could have a negative impact on our business 
many of our employees have only recently joined us 
if we are unable to integrate new employees in a timely and cost effective manner  our operating results may suffer 
we also need to increase the number of technical staff members with experience in high speed networking applications  asic design and software development as we further develop our product line 
competition for these highly skilled employees in our industry is intense 
our failure to attract and retain these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could hinder the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
in addition  employees may leave our company and subsequently compete against us 
moreover  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may be subject to claims of this type in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel and some of these claims may result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
we plan to increase our international sales activities  which will subject us to additional business risks 
our revenue from international sales represented of our total revenue for the year ended december  we plan to expand our international sales activities  especially in europe and asia 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to establish relationships with international distributors  establish foreign operations  effectively manage international sales channels  hire additional personnel and develop relationships with service organizations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to establish  generate and build market demand for our products internationally 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks  including increased complexity and costs of managing international operations  multiple protectionist  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivables  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights  and political and economic instability 
these factors and others could harm future sales of our products to international customers  which would negatively impact our business and operating results 
to date  none of our international revenue has been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
in the future  a portion of our international revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies  including the euro  which would subject us to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
our san interconnect products are subject to us department of commerce export control restrictions 
neither our customers nor we may export those products without obtaining an export license 
these us export laws also prohibit the export of our san interconnect products to a number of countries deemed by the united states to be hostile 
these restrictions may make foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products more competitive in the global market than are our customers or we 
the us government may not approve any pending or future export license requests 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised 
the sale of our san interconnect products could be harmed by our failure or the failure of our customers to obtain the required government licenses or by the costs of compliance 
our products must comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations  and if we cannot develop products that are compatible with these evolving standards  our business will suffer 
the market for san products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as they emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
to remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these industry standards 
all components of a san must utilize the same standards in order to operate together 
our products comprise only a part of an entire san and we depend on the companies that provide other components  many of which are significantly larger than we are  to support industry standards as they evolve 
we also depend on our competitors to support these same industry standards 
the failure of these providers or our competitors to support these industry standards could negatively impact market acceptance of our products 
in addition  in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop also will be required to comply with standards established by authorities in various countries 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could materially harm our business 
our intellectual property protection may prove to be inadequate which could negatively affect our ability to compete 
we believe that our continued success depends on protecting our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
efforts to protect our intellectual property could be time consuming and expensive and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain any of our technology as trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  or at all 
third party claims of infringement of their intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we occasionally receive communications from third parties alleging patent infringement  and there always is the chance that third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
future patent infringement disputes  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available or that they could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we fail to obtain these royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to several factors  including but not limited to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  losses of our key oems or reduction in their purchases of our products  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of capital stock 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance 
we may not be able to meet our future capital requirements  limiting our ability to grow 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next twelve months 
however  we may need  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms  or at all 
further  if we issue equity securities  existing stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated funding requirements 
we may engage in future acquisitions that may dilute our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities 
we may review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway  we may buy businesses  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any future purchases  we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
these purchases also involve numerous risks  including problems assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
our corporate offices and principal product development facility are located in a region that is subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our corporate offices in bothell  washington and research facility in irvine  california are located near major earthquake faults 
we are not specifically insured for earthquakes  or other such natural disasters 
any personal injury or damage to the facilities as a result of such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and delaware law could adversely affect the performance of our stock 
our stockholder rights plan and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
the stockholder rights plan and these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which could harm our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities  the majority of which are commercial paper and government securities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
our investment portfolio  with a fair value of million as of december   is invested in commercial paper  government securities and corporate indebtedness that could experience an adverse decline in fair value should an increase in interest rates occur 
in addition  declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge against this interest rate exposure 
all of our revenue is realized in us dollars and is from customers primarily headquartered in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange risk
