the company produces and markets over ales and lagers under the pyramid and thomas kemper brands 
in  pyramid added a line of hand crafted sodas  including root beer and other premium flavors  to its business when it acquired the thomas kemper soda company 
the company also operates restaurants adjacent to its two breweries  under the pyramid alehouse brand name 
the company s breweries produce high quality  full flavored beers in small batches using traditional brewing methods 
the company also produces old fashioned  full flavored  hand crafted sodas 
the company s two breweries  one in seattle  washington seattle brewery and one in berkeley  california berkeley brewery  had an estimated total annual beer production capacity of  barrels as of the end of the seattle brewery opened in march with an initial estimated annual beer capacity of  barrels 
during  ten fermenting vessels were moved from seattle to the berkeley brewery which reduced the seattle brewery annual beer production capacity to  barrels 
the berkeley brewery was completed in february with an initial estimated annual beer production capacity of  barrels and was expanded during to a total beer capacity of  barrels 
the company believes that the breweries and adjacent alehouses provide increased consumer awareness and loyalty for the company s brands by increasing opportunities for sampling and local product promotion 
the company s pyramid and thomas kemper beer brands compete primarily in the craft beer category  and secondarily in the larger specialty category which includes craft beers  imports and super premium beers 
craft beers are a small segment of the estimated billion dollar brewing industry 
craft beers are distinguishable from mass produced beers by their wide range of fuller flavors and adherence to traditional european styles and ingredients 
industry experts estimate that total beer shipments  including imports  increased in  while craft beer shipments  which comprise approximately of the total  were estimated to have increased by 
the company has been successful in marketing a full line of flavorful ales and lagers 
under the pyramid brand  pyramid hefeweizen  pyramid apricot ale and pyramid snowcap are the company s best selling ales 
under the thomas kemper brand  the company brews authentic german styles in addition to styles popularized in other european countries 
thomas kemper weizenberry is currently the company s best selling beer within the thomas kemper brand 
craft beers generally sell for retail prices ranging from to per six pack  retail prices are set independently by distributors and retailers 
the company s retail prices are usually at the high end of this range 
increased consumer demand for high quality  full flavored beers allows for a price premium relative to mass produced domestic beers 
this price premium results in higher profit margins  which can motivate distributors and retailers to offer and promote craft beers 
the company s craft beers are sold primarily in washington  oregon and california  which accounted for approximately of the company s beer sales 
the company participates in the craft soda category with a line of old fashioned  hand crafted sodas sold under the thomas kemper soda company label 
thomas kemper soda s premium soft drinks include root beer  cream soda  orange cream soda and black cherry soda 
during march  the company introduced two new flavors  grape and ginger ale  to the thomas kemper soda portfolio 
the company distributes its soda products in supermarkets  independent food stores  convenience stores and restaurants 
craft sodas typically sell for to per six pack  with prices being set independently by distributors and retailers 
the prices for craft sodas are substantially higher than the mass produced brands  due to their flavor profile  unique and upscale packaging and flavors  and strong consumer demand 
the company currently operates restaurants adjacent to its seattle and berkeley breweries 
the restaurants are operated under the pyramid alehouse brand name 
in  the restaurants contributed sales of  including approximately  in the company s beers and sodas and more than  in branded clothing and other merchandise 
the restaurants have a total of over seats  plus outdoor eating areas  and are both situated in highly visible  high traffic locations 
the alehouses had approximately  guest visits during the company s beverage operations contributed of net sales in  with beer comprising and soda 
alehouse operations contributed of net sales in business strategy as a result of a strategic review in  the company has developed a balanced internal and external growth strategy which includes growing the company s beverage portfolio in its core western markets  expanding the alehouse division through the development of new properties and new acquisitions  and continuing to improve the company s cost structure 
key elements of the company s strategy are i building a strong portfolio of craft beer brands  ii increasing the focus on the craft soda business  iii building brand awareness and sales through company owned restaurants  and iv maintaining a direct store delivery dsd distribution system 
building a strong portfolio of craft beer brands the company is committed to producing a portfolio of high quality craft beers to appeal to a variety of discerning consumer tastes 
the company currently markets over styles of beer under the pyramid and thomas kemper brands 
the pyramid brand accounted for of the company s beer sales and of the company s beverage sales in the company continues to seek opportunities to develop or acquire other distinctive regional brands  which may help broaden the company s product portfolio and strengthen the company s presence geographically 
the wide range of styles enables the company to obtain better market penetration through greater shelf space for its packaged products in retail stores and additional tap handles in draft beer outlets 
the company brews all of its beers and specialty beverages in company operated breweries providing direct control of the entire production process from purchase of ingredients to packaging and shipment 
the proximity of the company s breweries to its key west coast markets helps optimize product freshness  reduces freight costs and minimizes the inventory of kegs required to service draft accounts 
the company focuses on local sales and marketing strategies to build its brands 
it uses targeted advertising and promotions  event marketing  sponsorships  beer festivals and targeted charitable donations of its products to assist in developing its market presence 
the company also has an award winning website and an active public relations program 
the company does not compete directly with the national brands in terms of mass media advertising 
increasing the focus on the craft soda business the company acquired the thomas kemper soda company in since that time  the brand has added significant revenues to the company  with a net sales growth of 
the soda business represented of beverage net sales in  and of total net sales 
during march  the company introduced two new flavors  grape and ginger ale  to the thomas kemper soda portfolio 
the craft soda category possesses many characteristics that are similar to the craft beer category  and the company believes it can leverage its experience and existing infrastructure to further develop the thomas kemper brands 
the company will also seek opportunities to expand the craft soda portfolio within its core western markets 
building brand awareness and sales through company owned restaurants the company s breweries and restaurants are focal points for marketing  creating brand awareness  and generating sampling opportunities for the company s products 
initially  the breweries provided the attraction to introduce consumers to the company s craft products 
however  the restaurants have now become popular and a significant source of revenues 
in addition to providing sampling and educational opportunities to alehouse customers  the company s breweries and restaurants are extensively used to entertain the beverage trade and build relationships with distributors 
the breweries and restaurants highly knowledgeable employees are an important source of education and training for the company s distributors and retailers 
the company intends to further develop the alehouse concept via new developments or acquisitions of existing brewpubs 
these sites would not be full scale production breweries  but rather would produce beer for local consumption and sales 
experience has shown that the local status of a brand is an important determinant of success  and also provides clear differentiation versus other specialty beers 
maintaining a direct store delivery dsd system through independent distributors the company distributes its products through a network of selected independent distributors who deliver directly to local grocery stores  convenience stores  restaurants and taverns 
the company feels that this type of distribution system is best suited for developing local distribution of company products  particularly in draft beer accounts  where there are important sampling and brand building opportunities 
the company has not aligned itself with the distribution system of a single larger brewer 
this approach allows the company to select distributors in each market that it believes will focus the greatest attention on its products and best promote its high quality craft beers and sodas 
additionally  the ability to change distribution arrangements for performance related issues is an important advantage 
during  the company distributed its products through wholesalers in states and canada 
products the company produces over authentic  full flavored  european beer styles using traditional ingredients and brewing methods 
eight of these styles are available on a seasonal basis  and others are available only in certain geographic areas in accordance with the company s regional marketing strategy 
each unique beer style is brewed with malted barley and wheat grains  hops and  where appropriate  natural fruit extracts and spices 
the company avoids the use of less expensive ingredients due to its belief that quality is supremely important to success in the craft beer segment 
a similar philosophy is adopted with regard to the company s soda products 
each batch of soda is made from high quality ingredients  rather than from diluting mass produced syrups 
the sodas are characterized by much more pronounced flavors 
the company s beverages are not pasteurized and are currently distributed only in bottles and kegs 
the company will continue to innovate  develop and test new products in order to meet the varying and changing tastes of its consumers 
competition competition within the craft beer and soda markets is based on product quality  taste  consistency  freshness  distribution  price  ability to differentiate products  promotional methods and other product support 
the number of competitors has increased dramatically in the past four years 
statistics from the latest study of the institute of brewing studies indicate there were approximately  craft brewers in the united states at the end of approximately two thirds of these brewers are brewpubs that sell all of their production at retail on the brewery premises 
the remaining brewers market their products through similar channels to those utilized by the company and  although many have limited geographic distribution  the result is significantly increased competition in all markets 
the company s past sales growth was achieved predominantly through increasing penetration in washington  oregon and california  which the company believes comprise one of the largest and most competitive craft and specialty beer markets in the united states 
as this market has matured  the company has experienced intensified competition  increased seasonal product offerings and aggressive price promotions 
although certain competitors distribute their products nationally and may have greater sales and financial resources than the company  the company believes that being a local supplier of high quality  traditionally brewed ales  lagers and sodas will differentiate the company s products and allow it to obtain good market share in those markets adjacent to its breweries and alehouses 
the company also competes against producers of imported specialty beers 
although imported beers currently account for a much greater share of the us beer market than craft beers  the company believes that craft brewers have a number of competitive advantages over specialty beer imports  including lower transportation costs  no importation duties  proximity to and familiarity with local consumers  a higher degree of product freshness and eligibility for lower federal excise taxes 
in response to the growth of the craft beer segment in prior years  all of the national domestic brewers have introduced full flavored beers 
national brewers  with their greater financial resources  access to raw materials and their influence over their established national distribution networks  have increased competition for market share and increased price competition within the craft beer segment 
the company is aware that certain national brewing companies are using their considerable influence over their independent distributors to induce them to exclude competing products from their portfolios 
there is also evidence that distributors are consolidating to improve profit margins 
these factors could have the effect of reducing the distribution options for the company s products 
while such actions have not at this time denied access to any market for the company s products  there can be no guarantee that this will not happen in the future 
item properties the company currently owns and operates two breweries  each with an adjacent restaurant  one in seattle  washington and one in berkeley  california 
the estimated total annual beer capacity of the two breweries was  and  barrels at the end of and  respectively 
during august  ten fermenting vessels were moved from the seattle brewery to the berkeley brewery and soda equipment was then added to the seattle brewery 
this redistribution of production equipment and change in production mix of beer and soda resulted in increased company wide brewing capacity

the brewery had an estimated beer production capacity of  and  barrels at the end of and  respectively 
during  fermentation capacity was added which increased the estimated annual beer capacity to  barrels 
the berkeley brewery has a designed maximum potential capacity in excess of  barrels  which can be achieved by adding more fermentation capacity 
the berkeley alehouse has seating for plus an outdoor seating area 
the building was leased commencing november for a year term  with options to extend the lease term for two five year periods

the company currently sells its beverage products primarily in washington  oregon and california under the pyramid and thomas kemper brand names and operates two restaurants  under the pyramid alehouse name  each adjacent to its seattle  washington and berkeley  california breweries

for the years ended december  and  approximately of the company s net sales were sales of beer and soda to third party distributors 
total retail alehouse sales accounted for of total net sales in and the company s sales volumes and selling prices are affected by several factors such as level of consumer demand in existing markets  sales in new distribution areas  availability of beer distributors in new and existing markets  and competitive factors  including the increase or decrease in the number of competing craft beers  new product introductions and promotional pricing 
sales in the craft beer industry generally reflect a significant degree of seasonality with the second and third calendar quarters reflecting stronger sales than in the first and fourth calendars quarters

risk factors and forwarding looking statements the company does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
however this report does contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  which are subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
there are numerous important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made by the company 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
increasing competition 
the domestic market in which the company s craft beers compete is highly competitive for many reasons  including the continuing proliferation of new beers and brew pubs  efforts by regional craft brewers to expand their distribution  the introduction of fuller flavored products by certain major national brewers  and underutilized craft brewing capacity 
the company anticipates that intensifying competition from craft beer and imported beer producers and excess capacity in the craft beer segment may adversely impact the company s operating margins 
in addition  the larger national brewers have developed brands to compete directly with craft beers 
these national competitors have advantages such as lower production costs  larger marketing budgets  greater financial and other resources and more developed and extensive distribution networks than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to grow its volumes or be able to maintain its selling prices in existing markets or as it enters new markets 
access to markets 
most of the company s independent distributors are also distributors of national brewers  some of whom have used their greater influence and marketing resources to persuade those distributors to exclude the products of other breweries from their portfolios 
such actions by national brewers have the effect of reducing distribution options for the company s products 
in addition  there is evidence that independent distributors are moving towards consolidation to improve profit margins 
although the company has not yet been negatively impacted by such events  it is possible that the company could effectively be denied access to a market or markets by the tactics of the national brewers and further consolidation of independent distributors 
in the states that comprise the majority of its sales  the company has the option to distribute its products directly to retailers and the company has previous experience in doing so 
however  there is no assurance that self distribution can be done in an economic manner over large territories

the company s business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels  and its brewery and restaurant operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where the company intends to do business could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to conduct its business 
certain states have laws restricting or forbidding a combined pub and brewery 
further  federal regulations prohibit  among other things  the payment of slotting allowances to retailers for beer products 
these regulations have the effect of preventing competitors with greater financial resources from excluding smaller brewers from retailers 
if these regulations were repealed or substantially modified  there would likely be a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
selling prices 
the future selling prices the company charges for its craft beer and other specialty beverages may decrease from historical levels due to increasing competitive pressures 
the company has and will continue to participate in price promotions with its wholesalers and their retail customers 
management believes that the number and frequency of the company s promotions will increase during variability of margins and operating results 
the company anticipates that its operating margins will fluctuate and may decline as a result of many factors  including i lower sales volumes and selling prices  ii increased depreciation and other fixed and semi fixed operating costs as a percent of sales during periods when the company s breweries are producing below designed capacity  iii increased raw material and packaging costs  iv changes in product mix and packaging  v increased transportation costs  vi increased sales from retail operations which may have a lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales than beer sales  and vii increased selling and promotional costs incurred as the company protects its business in existing markets 
increases in federal or state excise taxes and the impact of an increasing average federal excise tax rate as production increases may also cause a decline in the company s gross margins 
the company pays federal excise taxes on all beer sales and pays state excise taxes on beer sales occurring in various states at various tax rates 
the federal excise tax is per barrel on the first  barrels and per barrel exceeding  annually  as long as total annual sales are less than two million barrels 
the washington state excise tax is per barrel annually and the california state excise tax is per barrel annually 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such an event  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
impact of inflation although the company has not attempted to calculate the effect of inflation  management does not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the future  increases in costs and expenses  particularly energy  packaging  raw materials and labor costs may have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such cost increases cannot be passed along to its customers
