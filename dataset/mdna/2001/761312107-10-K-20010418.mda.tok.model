sales increases of million in the metals group s materials handling and computer assisted picking systems product line including million from kingway since it was acquired by the company on march   million in seamless pressure vessels  million in bridge fabrication sales and million in spring sales were partially offset by decreases of million in heavy duty crane sales and million in cylinder sales 
the increase in material handling sales reflects the acquisition of kingway and increased demand and large project bid wins 
the increase in pressure vessel sales in was due to strong first and second quarter order levels which began to ship in the second half 
heavy duty crane sales continue to be impacted by weak order levels due to a downturn in large capital project spending in the steel industry caused by strong foreign competition 
during the first quarter of  the company moved to counter this trend by entering the steel bridge fabrication market 

management believes the company s crane manufacturing processes are ideally suited for complex bridge manufacturing and seeks to position the company to participate in what management anticipates will be a significant increase in state and federal transportation spending on bridges through the year 
sales of cylinders was down due to softness in the hydraulic cylinder market 
sales of leaf springs were up slightly compared to metals group gross profit for was million  or of sales  compared to million for  or of sales  an increase of million 
gross profit in both dollars and as a percentage of sales increased during compared to primarily due to the acquisition of kingway which has higher margin products than chatwins group s pre merger material handling products  the increase in volume and a change in product mix to the higher margin seamless pressure vessels 
plastics group plastics group sales for since the march  merger totaled million 
such sales resulted in a plastics group gross profit of million  or of sales 
on a pro forma basis as if the plastics group was acquired on january   plastics group sales in totaled million  compared to million for excluding the irish plastics business for reasons of comparability  such sales would be million for and million for  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in revenues is the continuation of a trend which began in and resulted from several factors  including certain customers relocating manufacturing operations to mexico and asia  reduced customer orders for continuing programs  end of product cycles and delays in new program starts  which affected all plastics group facilities 

management was investigating the feasibility of opening or acquiring a molding facility in mexico or establishing a joint venture in mexico with an existing plastics molding company in order to counter these trends 
however  management s view of current business conditions in mexico and the impact on the company s liquidity caused by the need to fund increased working capital demands in the company s seamless pressure vessel product line due to a substantial increase in order levels in the first quarter of has cause management to put this plan on hold temporarily 
accordingly  the trend in plastics group revenue could continue into 
plastics group gross profit for was million  or of sales 
on a pro forma basis  plastics group gross profit for was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for excluding the irish plastics business for reasons of comparability  gross profit would be million  or of sales  for and million  or of sales  for  a decrease of million or

excluding these gains  other expense for was million  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in other expense for compared to is due to an increase in goodwill amortization as a result of the higher level of goodwill of post merger reunion compared to the level of goodwill of pre merger chatwins group 
other than the gains on sales discussed above and the increased level of goodwill amortization  there were no individually significant or offsetting items in either or interest expense interest expense  net  for was million plus million included in discontinued operations  compared to million for plus million included in discontinued operations  indicating an increase of million
