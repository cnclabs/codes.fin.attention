the company cautions that historical results should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by  or on behalf of  the company include the following  some of which are described in greater detail below the pattern of the company s sales  including variations in sales volume within periods  the acceptance by the company s customers and consumers of new products and line extensions  the mix of products sold  the company s ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials  the prices of the company s products and the response of the company  its customers and competitors to changes in prices  technological advances by the company and or its competitors  new patents granted to the company and or its competitors  changes in exchange rates in one or more of the company s geographic markets  changes in accounting policies  or the impact of general economic conditions in the united states and in other countries in which the company currently does business 
competitive environment the company experiences intense competition for sales of its products in most markets 
the company s products compete with widely advertised  well known  branded products  as well as private label products  which typically are sold at lower prices 
in most of its markets  the company has major competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified than the company 
aggressive competition within the company s markets to preserve  gain or regain market share can affect the company s results in any given period 
changes in technology and new product introductions in most product categories in which the company competes  there are continuous technological changes and frequent introductions of new products and line extensions 
the company s ability to successfully introduce new products and or extend lines of existing products will depend on  among other things  the company s ability to identify changing consumer tastes and needs  develop new technology  differentiate its products and gain market acceptance of new products 
the company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve these goals 
with respect specifically to primary alkaline batteries  category growth could be adversely affected by the following factors technological or design changes in portable electronic and other devices that use batteries as a power source  continued improvement in the service life of primary batteries  improvements in rechargeable battery technology  and the development of new battery technologies 
intellectual property the company relies upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain its proprietary rights in technology  products and the company s brands 
the company s intellectual property rights  however  could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
the company does not believe that its products infringe the intellectual property rights of others  but such claims  if they are established  can result in material liabilities or loss of business 
cost savings strategy the company has implemented a number of programs designed to reduce costs 
such programs will require  among other things  the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures  all of which present significant management challenges 
there can be no assurance that such actions will be accomplished as rapidly as anticipated or that the full extent of expected cost reductions will be achieved 
sales and operations outside of the united states sales outside of the united states represent a substantial portion of the company s business 
in addition  the company has a number of manufacturing facilities and suppliers located outside of the united states 
accordingly  the following factors could adversely affect operating results in any reporting period changes in political or economic conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tax laws  or longer payment cycles in certain countries 
the company also is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk to its sales  profits  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
although the company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks through foreign currency forward  swap and option contracts and non us dollar denominated financings  there can be no assurance that the company will be fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations 
retail environment with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  especially in developed markets such as the united states and europe  the company is increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
accordingly  the company faces greater pressure from retail trade customers to provide more favorable trade terms 
the company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space and other conditions 
many of the company s customers  particularly the company s high volume retail trade customers  have engaged in accelerated efforts to reduce inventory levels and change inventory delivery systems 
while the company expects the level of trade inventory of its products to decline over time  the speed and magnitude of such reductions and or the inability of the company to develop satisfactory inventory delivery systems could adversely affect operating results in any reporting period
