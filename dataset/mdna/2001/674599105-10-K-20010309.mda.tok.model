item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations incorporating item a business environment oil and natural gas industry during  west texas intermediate wti crude oil traded in a wide range  dipping briefly below bbl in april and above bbl in september 
the highest prices were seen in the third and fourth quarter  but they slipped considerably in december  ending the year at under bbl 
however  average crude oil prices for the year were slightly above bbl  the highest annual average since overall  the crude oil market continues to indicate uncertainty  both in long term direction and in short term price equilibrium 
nymex domestic natural gas prices were also volatile in  ranging from approximately thousand cubic feet mcf to mcf 
natural gas prices finished the year very strong  with the fourth quarter averaging over mcf  more than double the average prices in the first quarter 
a supply shortage  depleting inventories and an early winter all combined to raise gas prices to record levels 
chemical industry in the first half of  the chemical industry experienced strong product demand and overall economic growth  but in the second half experienced a slowdown in product demand that triggered significant inventory corrections among customers and distributors 
in the second half of  the us economy started showing signs of softening in the housing  auto and other consumer products related industries 
also  us exports of major commodities were constrained as asia and latin america continued to struggle to improve domestic demand 
the combination of high energy and feedstock costs and reduced product demand decreased profit margins significantly 
domestic chlorine demand increased in over due to overall strong chlorine demand in chemicals  other than vinyls 
chlorine pricing improved in the first quarter through the third quarter before falling as fourth quarter demand dropped 
caustic soda prices declined through the first three quarters due to over supply  but strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter as supply became limited due to major cutbacks in chlorine production 
polyvinyl chloride pvc prices continued to improve during the first half before reaching a peak in june 
then prices weakened as a combination of poor demand and inventory corrections took hold 
strategic overview and review of business results strategy occidental s strategy is unchanged since and consists of two basic elements o shift corporate assets to large  long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential occidental will continue to swap or sell marginal assets or assets that are nearing the end of their economic life cycle and replace them with assets such as altura and elk hills that give it critical mass in its core markets 
occidental also refocused its exploration and enhanced recovery programs to concentrate primarily in the us  the middle east and latin america 
o harvest cash from chemicals to invest in profitable growth opportunities and support debt reduction  occidental enhanced its position in core chemical product markets by entering into strategic alliances that have resulted in cost saving synergies 
specific actions oil and gas in implementing its strategy  occidental has significantly strengthened its operations in the us  middle east and latin america 
by concentrating on large assets in these core areas  occidental has used economies of scale to reduce operating costs and improve margins 
occidental has taken a series of steps since to improve overall domestic oil and gas performance beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills field in california 
each action is discussed below in the business review 
occidental also consolidated its operations by focusing on states and exiting others 
occidental has interests in california  kansas  new mexico  oklahoma and texas  with california and texas being the primary areas of focus 
occidental is no longer active in alabama  alaska  arkansas  colorado  louisiana  mississippi  montana  north and south dakota  utah and wyoming 
outside the us  occidental reduced the number of countries in which it was involved from in to in today  occidental operates in albania  colombia  ecuador  indonesia  oman  pakistan  peru  qatar  russia and yemen 
occidental sold producing properties in venezuela  the dutch north sea and peru and exited angola  china  egypt  gabon  hungary  ireland and vietnam  among others 
occidental also completed asset swaps that strengthened its position in its core areas 
these are discussed below by individual country 
chemicals in its chemicals business  occidental focused on the chlorovinyls chain where it takes ethylene and chlorine  which is co produced with caustic soda  and converts them through a series of intermediate products into pvc 
additionally  to strengthen its position along the chlorovinyls chain  occidental entered into two major business alliances in  a vinyls partnership with geon now known as polyone named oxy vinyls  lp oxyvinyls  and in a petrochemicals investment in equistar chemicals  lp equistar 
corporate occidental sold all the shares of midcon corp midcon  its natural gas transmission and marketing business  and exchanged a related note for a total of billion in january given the prospects for limited growth in its key markets  occidental concluded that midcon was a non strategic asset 
in addition  occidental redeemed million preferred shares in march  which saved approximately million annually in preferred stock dividend costs 
occidental received million from chevron in a litigation settlement in november  which was used mainly to reduce high cost debt 
in april  occidental sold its interest in canadian occidental petroleum ltd  now renamed nexen inc canadianoxy or nexen 
after tax proceeds  together with tax benefits from the disposition of the peru producing properties  totaled million and were used in its debt reduction program following the altura acquisition 
debt structure occidental s total debt comprises three components  as shown in the table below amounts in millions occidental other altura non public recourse recourse date debt debt debt total debt a april     pro forma post altura acquisition a includes trust preferred securities  natural gas delivery commitment  preferred stock and capital lease obligations  but excludes unamortized discount 
the table above reflects  on a pro forma basis  the effect of the billion altura acquisition debt on occidental s public debt as of april occidental s public debt at year end is more than billion below the year end level  and more than million below occidental s other recourse debt  which includes preferred stock and trust preferred securities in the above table  decreased from billion in to million in compared to the pro forma debt level in april  after the addition of both the altura recourse and non recourse debt  year end total debt is approximately million higher than at the end of for that million increase  net proved reserves increased percent from billion boe at the end of to billion boe at the end of total debt capitalization ratio date total debt capitalization ratio april pro forma post altura acquisition despite reflecting the altura acquisition during the year  occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio has declined to approximately percent from the percent level that existed at the end of the debt to capitalization ratio is computed by dividing total debt by total capitalization  excluding minority interest 
occidental intends to achieve additional debt reduction from free cash flow in return on equity average years a annual b years years years years return on equity a the return on equity for the multi year periods was calculated by computing the return on equity for each year  using earnings applicable to common stock and the average equity balance  and then averaging the return over the respective periods 
b the return in was calculated by dividing occidental s earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in the table above shows occidental s return on equity for the most recent   and year periods  as well as the return for the year these results include non recurring items such as asset sales and asset write downs 
this table shows significant and steady progress in improving occidental s returns on equity 
the improvement over the last three years reflects the growth of the oil and gas business  higher oil and gas prices and the effect of the special items 
these improvements also include an increase in occidental s equity of over billion during business review oil and gas altura acquisition occidental completed the acquisition of the altura properties  valued at billion  on april  since the acquisition  the altura properties have generated approximately million in operating cash flow after capital expenditures 
net production averaged  boe per day  barrels per day more than occidental initially projected 
the altura properties have been successfully integrated with occidental s existing permian operations making occidental the largest oil producer in texas 
occidental s permian basin occidental s portfolio of assets in the permian basin includes interests in of the largest fields ever discovered in the us and of the largest fields in the permian basin 
these fields are expected to provide a steady base of long lived production  as well as an opportunity for expansion through additional enhanced recovery operations 
with the altura acquisition  occidental has become a world leader in co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery technique 
currently  occidental has more than active co floods which provide about half of occidental s production in the permian basin 
milne point bravo dome swap occidental recently swapped its percent interest in the milne point field in alaska operated by british petroleum bp for bp s percent working interest in the bravo dome co unit in northern new mexico 
production of co at bravo dome is roughly equal to occidental s total co requirements in the permian basin 
because of third party sales commitments  bravo dome currently meets approximately percent of occidental permian s co demand 
this transaction assures occidental of a long term  secure supply of co to support the exploitation of its permian assets and enhances the value of its altura investment 
thums the purchase of the thums oil properties in long beach  california essentially offset production from the property occidental sold in peru 
thums production generates significantly higher price realizations than the peru operation and it has a much longer life 
at year end  net production was averaging  barrels per day 
gulf of mexico occidental monetized its interests on the continental shelf in the gulf of mexico gom  which would have required significant capital expenditures for future development 
elk hills acquisition elk hills has generated total free cash flow  after capital expenditures  of approximately billion since the acquisition 
beginning in  the first full year that occidental owned the field  production has held steady at approximately  boe per day 
since the date of acquisition  occidental has replaced percent of its total oil and gas production at elk hills 
additionally  occidental has succeeded at driving down its costs at elk hills 
since gas production in southern california has been selling at premium prices compared to almost all other domestic markets  the combination of high prices and low costs has resulted in very strong earnings from elk hills 
by the end of  occidental produced a total of million boe at elk hills since its acquisition in  and the property still has an estimated million boe of proved reserves 
occidental is currently in the early stages of a three year exploration program that has already achieved positive results 
the first test well was successful yielding million gross proved barrels 
production from this discovery has already begun 
middle east oman occidental is the operator on block in oman where it is actively developing six fields 
occidental holds a percent interest under a production sharing agreement and it operates the safah field in the northwest part of the block and the wadi latham al barakah fields in the south central part 
current gross production is  barrels of oil per day with more than  net to occidental 
the safah waterflood is now in its second year 
the field remains occidental s most important development project in oman and it expects to increase ultimate recovery from the safah field from percent to percent of the oil in place 
occidental s contract  which runs through  can be extended to upon completion of the waterflood 
occidental is also the operator and owner of a percent oil interest and a percent gas interest in block  where it began to drill the first exploration wells in the fourth quarter of pakistan occidental holds interests in the badin blocks in pakistan  which are operated by bp 
current gross production is  boe per day 
occidental s net share is approximately  boe per day 
data obtained from a three dimensional seismic survey on the badin blocks in and has significantly increased the success rate for both exploration and development while  at the same time  reducing dry hole costs 
current plans call for drilling to wells per year to develop existing and newly developed fields by the end of  and it is also continuing to evaluate additional exploration opportunities 
yemen in  occidental swapped its holdings in malaysia and the philippines  which had long lead times and intensive capital requirements  for shell s production interests in colombia and yemen 
in yemen  the asset swap allowed occidental to more than double its interest in the masila block  which is operated by nexen  to a percent working interest 
gross production has increased from  barrels per day early in  when operations began  to  barrels per day in occidental s net share was approximately  barrels per day in the current plan is to continue to exploit identified reserves through a focused drilling program over the next five years 
occidental believes this program will maintain gross production at approximately  barrels per day through in adjacent east shabwa  production has risen substantially since occidental acquired its percent interest in in a swap with unocal 
current gross production is averaging  barrels of oil per day from three fields  approximately  barrels of oil per day net to occidental  up from  at the time of the swap 
three dimensional seismic surveys planned for will help identify additional exploration objectives in east shabwa 
occidental is also evaluating exploration acreage 
qatar in qatar  occidental s strategy is to continue development of the offshore north dome and south dome fields 
since  it has produced about million gross barrels of oil in qatar 
total year end proved oil reserves net to occidental for both fields are estimated to be approximately million barrels 
combined production for the two fields in was approximately  barrels per day gross and approximately  barrels per day net to occidental 
at the north dome field  occidental is implementing a waterflood project to develop the shuaiba reservoir 
occidental expects to complete a water injection plant by the end of the first quarter of with injection capacity of  barrels of water per day and it plans to drill wells producers and injectors in in  occidental expects to begin further development of non shuaiba reserves 
occidental is also evaluating second generation enhanced recovery projects at the north dome field 
occidental has completed its evaluation of the south dome field and has submitted a full field development plan to the government 
saudi arabia the government of saudi arabia has decided to open its natural gas sector to foreign investment to help meet the kingdom s needs for fuel  electric power and water 
occidental was one of the firms invited by saudi authorities to submit letters of intent to participate in two of the three core natural gas and infrastructure ventures approved for development 
occidental  jointly with enron  has submitted proposals that include upstream exploration  development and production  midstream gathering  processing and transmission and downstream distribution 
libya occidental is also evaluating a series of opportunities in libya that focus on returning to operate the assets that it operated before the us government imposed sanctions in occidental sees significant potential for enhancing production from these older fields as well as applying state of the art technology to its existing exploration prospects 
occidental has a long track record of success in libya  but its return is contingent upon a shift in us policy permitting us companies to resume operation of their existing libyan assets 
latin america colombia in colombia  occidental is pursuing an aggressive drilling program to optimize the recovery of reserves from cano limon 
occidental completed development wells in  and expects to complete another wells in and wells in production in was  gross barrels of oil per day   barrels per day net to occidental 
although liftings have been significantly reduced since june due to disruptions of the cano limon pipeline  occidental presently anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract  which amount to less than percent of its worldwide proved oil and gas reserves 
occidental began drilling the gibraltar exploration well in november the well location is approximately miles west of cano limon and less than two miles from a major pipeline that is connected to the export market 
the pipeline has a capacity of  barrels per day and is currently percent full 
occidental expects to complete the well in mid year 
ecuador gross production from occidental s block interests in ecuador is currently averaging approximately  barrels of oil per day  net to occidental of  barrels per day 
occidental recently farmed out a percent economic interest in block to alberta energy company ltd 
aec 
this transaction reduces occidental s business and political risk in ecuador and is expected to largely fund its capital program in country for the next four years 
both occidental and aec are members of a consortium of producers that have formed an independent pipeline company to build a new heavy oil pipeline in ecuador 
ecuador is currently pipeline capacity constrained  so the new pipeline is expected to foster oil development 
the independent pipeline company has signed an agreement with the government to build a kilometer pipeline from the interior oriente basin to the coast of ecuador over a two year period 
the pipeline is expected to make it feasible for occidental to develop the potentially significant eden yuturi field it discovered several years ago in the southeastern edge of block business review chemicals the performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast from year to year  but when the market is strong  these businesses are capable of contributing strong earnings and cash flow 
after a strong first half of in the pvc business  sales declined in the second half as customers began to draw down inventories that had grown with the expectation of higher prices 
in occidental s chlor alkali business  the reduced demand for vinyls in the second half of has adversely impacted the chlorine market 
chlorine sales and operating rates have declined 
operating rates dropped to percent in the second half down from percent in the first half of the year 
feedstock and energy cost increases adversely affected earnings in the third and fourth quarter 
the upside to the reduced demand for chlorine is supply shortages in the caustic soda markets where demand has remained stable and prices are increasing 
petrochemical prices are expected to remain under increasing pressure with the startup of significant new capacity this year and next from basf fina  formosa plastics and union carbide nova chemicals 
margins are expected to remain compressed under the pressure of sustained high feedstock costs 
the primary goal of occidental s chemicals business is to harvest cash that can be used to reduce debt and to fund new opportunities 
as shown below  from through  total cash flow from the chemicals business was billion with billion in cash after capital expenditures coming from occidental s core chemical businesses 
asset sales  net of acquisitions  accounted for billion 
chemicals cash flow operating cash flow after capital expenditures billion asset sales  net of acquisitions billion total billion summary of results and plans for future growth in summary  the strategic moves made in the past three years have resulted in significant growth for occidental 
in oil and gas  occidental s profitability per barrel has grown significantly 
occidental has increased production by a compound annual growth rate of percent and it has increased its reserves to production ratio by percent 
upgrading its portfolio of assets has enabled occidental to improve both oil and gas price realizations 
operating and administrative costs have been reduced significantly since these actions contributed to substantial improvements in recurring earnings from occidental s oil and gas business 
in chemicals  occidental has delivered the synergies expected from its alliances 
when the chemical cycle turns upward  the chemical business will generate more cash flow 
from its pro forma high debt level in april  occidental exceeded its billion debt reduction target for by an additional million 
it has also improved its return on equity 
the growth in occidental s return on equity over the past three years demonstrates that its strategy for creating value is sound 
occidental has ongoing growth initiatives within its base assets to achieve the kind of growth necessary to exceed its financial targets 
in oil and gas  it will rely on a three pronged strategy that encompasses enhanced oil recovery  exploration and acquisitions 
in enhanced oil recovery  occidental has focused on two core areas the middle east and latin america where it has a long history of success 
in exploration  occidental has a focused program targeting opportunities in its core areas in the us  the middle east and latin america 
the commodity chemicals industry is currently under the pressure of high energy prices and soft demand 
when the industry begins to recover  occidental expects its core operations to generate strong cash flow 
overall  however  higher energy prices are a significant net benefit to occidental s earnings and cash flow 
outlook oil and natural gas the petroleum industry is a highly competitive business subject to significant volatility due to numerous external market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
while fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting crude oil prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  which make it difficult to accurately predict oil and natural gas prices 
however  weather patterns do have a more immediate effect  particularly on natural gas prices 
in the united states  the initially severe winter season increased demand for natural gas  and tight supply led to very low inventory levels 
inventories at the end of were at their lowest levels for that time of year since gas production in california of approximately million cubic feet per day accounts for about percent of occidental s total us gas production 
the california border and the henry hub prices are usually close in value 
in the late fall of  the price differential between henry hub and the california border began to increase driving california prices higher than the nymex index 
the reasons behind the increased differential are complex  but the change is due partially to supply disruptions caused when a major pipeline transporting gas from the southwestern states to california was temporarily out of commission 
subsequently  a myriad of other factors contributed to a further widening in the differential that exceeded in december and remains volatile on a day to day basis 
since there is a time lag of one month between occidental s gas production and recorded sales  the results from high gas prices in december will have a significant impact on the company s financial performance in the first quarter of the combination of high gas prices and low inventory levels  which continue in the first quarter of  and the unique characteristics of the california gas market  is expected to result in higher average gas price realizations for occidental in than in chemical the widely reported slowdown in the us economy reduced operating rates in petrochemicals and occidental s chlor alkali vinyls business to the low percent level 
these low operating rates are continuing in the first quarter 
normally  the chemical industry is profitable when operating rates range from the high to low percent levels 
under current conditions  occidental is unable to pass through to its customers the full cost of higher electricity and natural gas prices 
although overall pricing may improve in the chemical segment in the second half of  from the decline experienced in the second half of  higher energy and feedstock costs and lower demand would continue to have a negative effect on chemical margins 
specific comments by sub segment are given below 
chlor alkali domestic demand for chlorine is expected to grow approximately percent in  but industry capacity additions are expected to limit operating rates 
caustic soda markets should remain tight until the vinyls demand for chlorine strengthens 
chlorine prices peaked early in the third quarter of due to strong global demand for ethylene dichloride edc and strong domestic demand for pvc in the first half of the year 
later in the third quarter  reduced demand for chlorine resulted in falling prices and reduced operating rates 
liquid caustic soda demand remained steady and prices increased due to the reduced supply 
this trend of increasing prices for liquid caustic and declining prices for chlorine is expected to continue in occidental announced february  that it will temporarily suspend production at its convent  louisiana  chlor alkali and edc plant  effective february  the decision was made in response to sharply higher costs for raw materials  particularly ethylene feedstock and electricity 
the facility will remain idle until economic conditions improve 
vinyls for  demand is expected to increase from second half levels 
however  overall growth will remain modest  tempered by higher energy costs and lower consumer confidence 
excess pvc resin is expected to be available  and operating rates constrained  as the marketplace begins to absorb new capacity from the staged startup of the industry s major new pvc plant addition in louisiana 
overall  vinyls margins are expected to decline 
petrochemicals equistar industry forecasts project continued pressure on margins due to continued high feedstock costs combined with weak demand and capacity additions in the industry

derivative activities occidental s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
therefore  occidental periodically uses commodity futures contracts  options and swaps to hedge the impact of oil and natural gas price fluctuations  uses interest rate swaps and futures contracts to hedge interest rates on debt  and uses forward exchange contracts to hedge the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  was adopted in the first quarter of oil and gas trading contracts are measured at fair value on the balance sheet date 
gains and losses on such contracts are recognized in periodic income 
gains and losses on commodity futures contracts that qualify for hedge accounting  essentially those associated with equity production or purchases  are deferred until recognized as an adjustment to sales revenue or purchase costs when the related transaction being hedged is finalized 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts that hedge identifiable future commitments are deferred until recognized when the related item being hedged is settled 
all other contracts are recognized in periodic income 
at december   occidental was a party to commodity exchange and over the counter forward obligations 
the financial instruments held for purposes other than trading expire during the period from january to december  and relate to the hedging of natural gas and crude oil prices 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was million 
offsetting the value of these instruments are related physical positions with a million loss 
the principal components of these instruments and related physical positions are the related natural gas price swap and the natural gas delivery commitment  which is discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements 
at december   the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of these obligations was an unrealized loss of approximately million  which is currently deferred 
any gain or loss will be recognized when the related transactions are finalized 
the financial instruments held or issued for trading purposes mostly expire in  with the exception of a long term sales contract that expires in the fair value of these instruments at december  was million 
offsetting the value of these instruments are related physical positions with a million loss 
the approximate million net gain was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
the majority of the gain was from the mark to market adjustment of a long term sales contract under eitf issue no 
the results of oil and gas trading activities  excluding the long term sales contract  were not significant 
interest rate swaps are entered into as part of occidental s overall strategy to maintain part of its debt on a floating rate basis 
all of occidental s remaining interest rate swaps converting fixed rate debt to floating rate debt matured during november the swap rate difference resulted in approximately million of expense in  less than million of income in and approximately million of expense in  compared to what interest expense would have been had the debt remained at fixed rates 
the impact of the swaps on the weighted average interest rates for all debt in  and was not significant 
occidental will continue its strategy of maintaining part of its debt on a floating rate basis 
at december   occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks that are required to be settled on or prior to december  these financial instruments relate to debt raised by a third party to construct a co generation plant that will be subject to a long term operating lease to an oxychem affiliate 
as the lease payments will be directly related to the amount of interest paid on the underlying debt  the forward rate locks were put in place to hedge the future lease payments 
the lease payments are expected to commence on or before december  the fair value of these financial instruments at december  was an unrealized loss of million 
occidental is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its variable rate billion credit facilities 
at december   there were no outstanding aggregate balances under these credit facilities 
therefore  a change in interest rates would have had no effect on occidental s results of operations 
many of occidental s foreign oil and gas operations and foreign chemical operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar on a continuing basis 
generally  an effective currency forward market does not exist for these countries  therefore  occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
additionally  all of occidental s oil and gas foreign entities have the us dollar as the functional currency since the cash flows are mainly denominated in us dollars 
the effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 
foreign currencies that are in a net liability position are thus protected from the unfavorable effects of devaluation 
however  in certain foreign chemical subsidiaries and equity basis joint ventures where the local currency is the functional currency  occidental has exposure on joint venture debt that is denominated in us dollars 
for entities that have a net foreign currency asset position  occidental strives to maintain those positions at low levels to mitigate exposure to currency devaluation 
taxes deferred tax liabilities were billion at december   net of deferred tax assets of million 
the current portion of the deferred tax assets of million is included in prepaid expenses and other 
the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences 
lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants or as potentially responsible parties prp s in a substantial number of lawsuits  claims and proceedings  including governmental proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and corresponding state acts 
these governmental proceedings seek funding  remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  aggregating substantial amounts 
occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings  and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be incurred in those proceedings where it is probable that occidental will incur remediation costs which can be reasonably estimated 
in december  david croucher and others filed suit in the federal district court in houston  texas on behalf of persons claiming to have been beneficiaries of the midcon esop 
the suit has been certified as a class action 
the plaintiffs allege that each of the us trust company of california the esop trustee and the midcon esop administrative committee breached its fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs by failing to properly value the securities held by the esop  and allege that occidental actively participated in such conduct 
the plaintiffs claim that  as a result of this alleged breach  the esop participants are entitled to an additional aggregate distribution of at least million and that occidental has been unjustly enriched and is liable for failing to make that distribution 
in december  the named plaintiffs and defendants reached a proposed settlement of the action 
this settlement provides for occidental to pay the class million and fees and expenses of plaintiffs counsel as awarded by the court 
the court has scheduled a hearing on march  to consider approving the settlement 
occidental has adequate reserves 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by taxing authorities for varying periods in various tax jurisdictions 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that occidental and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from the foregoing lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters 
several of these matters may involve substantial amounts  and if these were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably to the full amount of their maximum potential exposure  an event not currently anticipated  it is possible that such event could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  in management s opinion  after taking into account reserves  it is unlikely that any of the foregoing matters will have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental expenditures occidental s operations in the united states are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining the quality of the environment 
foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and may continue to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures  related to current operations  are factored into the overall business planning process 
these expenditures are mainly considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws which require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to previous waste disposal practices 
and  in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or ownership or control of sites 
occidental is currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites  comparable state sites and other remediation sites  including occidental facilities and previously owned sites 
also  occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named as defendants and or as prp s under the federal superfund law 
these proceedings seek funding and or remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged personal injury or property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  aggregating substantial amounts 
occidental does not consider the number of superfund and comparable state sites at which it has been notified that it has been identified as being involved to be a relevant measure of exposure 
although the liability of a prp  and in many cases its equivalent under state law  may be joint and several  occidental is usually one of many companies cited as a prp at these sites and has  to date  been successful in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies 
also  many of these sites are still under investigation by the environmental protection agency epa or the equivalent state agencies 
prior to actual cleanup  the parties involved assess site conditions and responsibility and determine the appropriate remedy 
the majority of remediation costs are incurred after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval to proceed 
the ultimate future cost of remediation of certain of the sites for which occidental has been notified that it has been identified as being involved cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
as of december   occidental had been notified by the epa or equivalent state agencies or otherwise had become aware that it had been identified as being involved at superfund or comparable state sites 
this number does not include those sites where occidental has been successful in resolving its involvement 
the sites include former diamond shamrock chemical sites as to which maxus energy corporation has retained all liability 
of the remaining sites  occidental has denied involvement at sites and has yet to determine involvement in sites 
with respect to the remaining of these sites  occidental is in various stages of evaluation  and the extent of liability retained by maxus energy corporation is disputed at of these sites 
for of these sites  where environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated  occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be incurred 
the sites include sites as to which present information indicates that it is probable that occidental s aggregate exposure is insignificant 
in determining the reserves  occidental uses the most current information available  including similar past experiences  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
for the remaining of the sites being evaluated  occidental does not have sufficient information to determine a range of liability  but occidental does have sufficient information on which to base the opinion expressed above in the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for management s opinion on lawsuits and proceedings and on other environmental loss contingencies  see the above noted section 
environmental costs occidental s costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical environmental reserves corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
occidental did not incur any additional remediation expenses in  and capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in facilities 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
the environmental reserves  as shown in the table above  have been provided for environmental remediation liabilities at the superfund and comparable state sites discussed above  and for resource conservation and recovery act and other sites where occidental has environmental remediation responsibility 
the net decrease in environmental reserves reflects payments for remediation programs and settlement agreements 
occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary  glenn springs holdings  inc gsh 
in  gsh was given full management authority over all remediation sites and reports directly to occidental s corporate management 
foreign investments portions of occidental s assets outside north america are exposed to political and economic risks 
occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against such risks 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion was located in the middle east  approximately million was located in latin america  and substantially all of the remainder were located in russia and pakistan
