overview we provide real time e business intelligence solutions that enable enterprises to win  retain  and grow new customers and improve operational effectiveness 
we develop  market  and support products and services that help businesses collect  analyze  understand  and act on customer and operational information both in batch and in real time 
our products and services provide a way for an organization s employees  customers  and partners to use the internet to examine the internal data they already have and to supplement that data with external  value added information such as demographic  geographic  or other content and data feeds 
we refer to our products as real time e business intelligence solutions because they enable organizations to rapidly make more informed  intelligent decisions and to spread that ability across the enterprise 
revenue we sell our software products directly to our customers and through channel partners such as enterprise software vendors  resellers and distributors 
enterprise software vendors generally integrate our products with their applications and will embed them into their products or resell them with their products 
our other channel partners  principally resellers and distributors  sell our software products to end user customers 
we derive our revenue from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to the software products  including consulting  training  software and data updates  technical support and real time marketing services over the internet 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses to end users upon determination that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the software to a customer  determination that collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is probable  and determination that no undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the software 
if consulting services are essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the license revenue and the consulting service revenue are recognized as the services are performed 
our arrangements regarding sales of software licenses generally do not include services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
revenue for transactions with enterprise application vendors  oems  and distributors is generally recognized as earned when the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all related obligations on our part have been satisfied 
we provide for sales allowances on an estimated basis 
we accrue royalty revenue through the end of the reporting period based on reseller royalty reports or other forms of customer specific historical information 
in the absence of customer specific historical information  royalty revenue is recognized when the customer specific objective information becomes available 
any subsequent changes to previously recognized royalty revenues are reflected in the period when the updated information is received from the reseller 
however  if the contract stipulates an advance  non refundable royalty payment  revenue is recognized upon execution of the contract 
maintenance contracts generally call for us to provide technical support and software updates and upgrades to customers 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally on a straight line basis when all revenue recognition requirements are met 
other service revenue  primarily training and consulting  is generally recognized at the time the service is performed and when it is determined that the company has fulfilled our obligations resulting from the services contract 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 

the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated statement of financial position or results of operation 
statement of position   software revenue recognition sop was issued in by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa and amended by statements of position and we adopted sop effective january  based on our reading and interpretation of sop s  and  we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with sop s   and cost of revenue cost of revenue from license sales consists primarily of royalties  product packaging  shipping  media and documentation 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries and benefits of consulting  customer service and training personnel and fees paid to third party providers of data and data updates 
expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  travel  marketing programs  and facilities 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance  testing and facilities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sagent s finance  human resources  information systems and general management as well as legal and bad debt reserves 
results of operations for fiscal years ended december   and the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue 
the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
years ended december  revenue license service total revenue cost of revenue license service amortization of abandoned development projects total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative merger and integration charges acquired in process research and development total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss revenue our total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from to and million or from to the increase in revenues from to resulted from a increase in license revenues and a increase in service revenues 
while service revenues continued to increase steadily from to  license revenues increased only  resulting in overall revenue growth of 
license revenues increased to  and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from to and million or from to increases from to were primarily due to increased acceptance of the sagent solution  expansion in the domestic and international direct sales organization and expansion in the reseller channels resulting in increases in the number of licenses sold and average transaction size 
during  we experienced turnover in our sales force and restructured our sales organization resulting in reduced sales productivity 
although we believe that as of the beginning of the first quarter of  we had taken the actions necessary to restructure our sales force and refocus attention on increased sales productivity  there can be no assurance that such efforts will yield increased license revenue 
the average transaction size remained stable from to we anticipate that license revenue  which has represented a majority of our revenue in the past  will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
however  if we continue to experience turnover in our sales force and fail to expand our direct and indirect sales channels  our license revenue may decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
service revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million or from to and million or from to the increase in service revenues from to were due to increases in all components of service revenues consulting  training and maintenance related to the increase in the number of licenses sold and the increased average transaction size from the prior year 
training and consulting services relating to the acquisition of talus  inc in further increased service revenues from to the increase from to was primarily a result of our concerted efforts to involve the consulting organization in each license transaction as it concerns installation and implementation which led to higher customer satisfaction and follow on sales opportunities in the resulting months 
cost of revenue cost of revenue from license sales consists primarily of royalties  product packaging  shipping media and documentation 
cost of revenue from license sales was million  million and million in   and  respectively  representing  and of license revenue in the respective periods 
from to  the absolute dollar and percentage increase resulted from increased costs of royalties and documentation 
from to the absolute dollar and percentage decrease was primarily due to reduced royalties  reductions in headcount in this area  and increased efficiencies in packaging  shipping  media and documentation expense 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits of consulting  customer service and training personnel and fees paid to third party providers of data and data updates 
cost of services was million  million and million  in  and  respectively  representing  and of services revenue in the respective periods 
the absolute dollar increases were primarily due to increases in technical support staff and consultants 
the percentage decreases were due to improved utilization of consulting personnel  increased productivity of our customer service division and a reduction in the use of outside consultants to provide consulting and training services 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  travel  marketing programs  and branch facilities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the absolute dollar increases reflect the hiring of additional personnel in connection with building the direct  indirect and reseller oem channels and increased sales commissions associated with increasing revenues 
the percentage decrease from to was attributable to the increase in revenue in and a slower level of increasing sales resources in the qms group from the prior year 
in addition  amounts reflect the creation of user conferences  expanded advertising campaigns and design of the enterprise intelligence seminar series 
the percentage increase from to reflects the investment in building the direct and indirect sales organizations and the cost associated with the restructuring of the sales force in we believe that as we continue to expand our direct sales and presales support organization  our third party partnering relationships and our indirect channel sales organization on a worldwide basis  sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues  provided that our efforts to improve and expand our sales organization are successful in growing our revenues 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance  testing and facilities 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the absolute dollar increase in the respective periods was due to significant investment in the form of additional personnel to develop new versions of our software products  new product offerings and localization enhancements of existing products for foreign countries 
we believe that significant investment for research and development is essential to our future success and we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although such expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sagent s finance  human resources  information systems and general management as well as legal  accounting and bad debt expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the absolute dollar decrease from to was primarily due to increased efficiencies and reduced third party professional fees 
the absolute dollar increase from to was primarily due to the settlement of the timeline litigation  large non recurring third party professional fees  recruitment and relocation of our senior management team  certain executive compensation charges and an increase in bad debt allowance 
in particular  allowance for doubtful accounts increased from in to million in in addition  in we settled litigation with timeline inc by issuing shares of our common stock valued at million and in cash  and incurred million in expenses associated with recruitment and relocation of executive management 
the percentage decrease from to was attributable to reduced costs combined with increased revenues 
the percentage increase from to was attributable to the increased costs associated with the timeline litigation  expenses associated with relocation and hiring costs related to the new management team and the increase in bad debt allowance in we expect general and administrative expenses to rise in absolute dollars as we expand staffing to support operations  but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
merger related charges as a result of the business combination with qms on december   accounted for as a pooling of interests  we incurred merger related costs of million 
these costs included transaction costs  write off of duplicate equipment and other assets  and severance pay and outplacement for nine employees 
the residual accrual in the amount of million was reversed in as of december  there was no remaining balance as accrued merger related costs 
acquired in process technology as a result of the business combination with talus in february  we acquired certain in process technology 
this technology under development consisted of analytical software applications for high technology  manufacturing  food service and hospitality industries 
after considering such factors as degree of completion  technological uncertainties  costs incurred  and projected costs to complete  we expensed million of in process technology and allocated of the purchase price to additional intangible assets  primarily non compete agreements and the value of an assembled workforce 
the technology under development has been successfully integrated into our product line 
other we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets such as goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment on a periodic basis 
we have not recorded impairment expenses related to long lived assets in or  but we recognized million of amortization of abandoned development projects in as a component of cost of revenue 
if future events or changes in circumstances indicate that any of our long lived assets will not be recoverable  impairment expenses may be recognized to reduce their carrying values to then estimated fair values 
in we recorded million in other expenses related to the disposal of property and equipment 
income taxes at december  and  we had available net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately and million  respectively 
these carryforwards expire from to at december  and  we also had available research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million 
for federal and state tax purposes  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitation on annual utilization due to changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax law 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the deferred tax asset in future tax returns  we have placed a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the difference between the statutory rate of approximately federal and state  net of federal benefits and the tax benefit of zero that we have recorded is primarily due to our full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and marketable securities totaling million  a decrease of million from december  since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through private sales of equity securities  the use of equipment leases and the initial public offering of our common stock in april  not from cash generated by our business 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for such periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of funding ongoing operations 
during and  we financed the acquisition of property and equipment  primarily computer hardware and software  and leasehold improvements and furniture totaling million and million  respectively  through capital leases 
similar financing was not obtained in capital lease payments were 
million  million and 
million in  and  respectively 
during  we entered into a million bank line of credit agreement collateralized by certain of our assets 
the credit line allows for advances against eligible accounts receivable in an aggregate amount not to exceed the lesser of the committed revolving line or the borrowing base  less any outstanding letters of credit 
advances against the revolving line bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus  which was at december  as of december  and march   there were no advances on the line of credit 
the line of credit expires in june under the agreement  sagent is required to comply with certain covenants  among which are minimum liquidity ratios and tangible net worth ratios 
as of december   sagent was not in compliance with these covenants 
in february  we completed a private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock and received proceeds of million  net of million in offering costs 
in connection with the private placement  we issued to certain placement agents warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
we believe that the net proceeds from the private placement  together with any equipment lease lines  will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our operating requirements and may seek  even before such time  to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on acceptable or favorable terms or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of  and such adoption did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
risk factors that may affect future results any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the following information about risks  together with the other information contained in this annual report  before you decide whether to buy our common stock 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be unimportant could also impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or your investment 
we have a history of losses  expect losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we had stockholders equity of million as of december   and million as of december  we have not achieved profitability to date  and we expect to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
we have incurred significant operating expenses in the past and expect to do so again in the future and  as a result  will need to significantly increase revenues in order to achieve profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve profitability  and if we do achieve profitability  that we will be able to sustain profitability 
we have limited working capital and may need to raise additional capital in the future at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
in february  we completed a private placement of our common stock and received proceeds of million  net of offering costs 
to date  we have not achieved profitability or positive cash flow 
although we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and any net cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months  because our revenue is unpredictable  a revenue shortfall could deplete our limited financial resources and require us to reduce operations substantially or to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings 
there can be no assurance any equity or debt financing will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that if available  such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will take actions to conserve our cash balances  including significantly reducing our operating expenses  downsizing our staff and closing existing branch offices  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and our ability to reduce losses or generate profits 
we may not be able to manage expenses given the unpredictability of our revenue we expended significant resources in and to build our infrastructure and hire personnel  particularly in our consulting services and sales and marketing groups 
we currently expect to continue to hire personnel in in order to support anticipated higher revenue levels 
consequently  we continue to incur a relatively high level of short term fixed expenses 
if planned revenue growth does not materialize  our business  financial condition and results of operation will be materially harmed 
pending litigation could harm our business 
from october  to november   several class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court on behalf of the individual investors who purchased our common stock between october  and april  the claims allege that we misrepresented our and prospects 
the court recently consolidated the complaints and selected a lead plaintiff and counsel 
a consolidated amended complaint will be filed in april on november   a derivative lawsuit was filed by a purported sagent shareholder in the superior court of california 
on february   a second derivative lawsuit was filed 
the complaints name certain of our present and former officers and directors as defendants 
the principal allegation of the complaints is that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to sagent 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business and financial condition 
in particular  the lawsuits could harm our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
the continued defense of the lawsuits could also result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
the lawsuits could also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirors from bidding for us or reducing the consideration they would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payment could seriously harm our financial condition 
variations in quarterly operating results due to such factors as changes in demand for our products and changes in our mix of revenues may cause our stock price to decline 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
we therefore believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance  and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance or the future performance of our stock price 
our short term expense levels are relatively fixed and are based on our expectations of future revenues 
as a result  a reduction in revenue in a quarter may harm our operating results for that quarter 
our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our operating results in future quarters fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock will fall 
factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly basis are varying size  timing and contractual terms of orders for our products  lengthy sales and implementation cycles associated with our products  our ability to timely complete our service obligations related to product sales  changes in the mix of revenue attributable to higher margin product license revenue as opposed to substantially lower margin service revenue  customers decisions to defer orders or implementations  particularly large orders or implementations  from one quarter to the next  changes in demand for our software or for enterprise software and real time marketing solutions generally  announcements or introductions of new products by our competitors  software defects and other product quality problems  our ability to integrate acquisitions  any increase in our need to supplement our professional services organization by subcontracting to more expensive consulting organizations to help provide implementation  support and training services when our own capacity is constrained  and our ability to hire  train and retain sufficient engineering  consulting  training and sales staff 
if we fail to expand our direct and indirect sales channels  we will not be able to increase revenues 
in order to grow our business  we need to increase market awareness and sales of our products and services 
to achieve this goal  we need to increase both our direct and indirect sales channels 
if we fail to do so  this failure could harm our ability to increase revenues 
we currently receive substantially all of our revenues from direct sales  but we intend to increase sales through indirect sales channels in the future 
we also need to expand our direct sales force by hiring additional salespersons and sales management 
we intend to derive revenues from indirect sales channels by selling our software through value added resellers 
these resellers offer our software products to their customers together with consulting and implementation services or integrate our software solutions with other software 
we also intend to increasingly offer our software through application service providers  who install our software on their own computer servers and charge their customers for access to that software 
we need to expand our indirect sales channels by entering into additional relationships with these third parties 
we expect as part of our strategy to increase international sales principally through the use of indirect sales channels 
we will be even more dependent on indirect sales channels in the future due to our international strategy 
we also plan to use international direct sales personnel and therefore must hire additional sales personnel outside the united states 
our ability to develop and maintain these channels will significantly affect our ability to penetrate international markets 
we have a relatively new management team and there is no guarantee that they will be successful in growing our business 
our management team has not worked together for a significant length of time and may not be able to successfully implement our strategy 
ben c 
barnes  our chief executive officer  joined us in august  replacing founder ken gardner 
david eliff  our chief financial officer  joined us in may jack peters  senior vice president  sales americas  robert flynn  senior vice president  marketing  and arthur parker  president general manager europe  middle east and africa  joined us in september  november and january  respectively 
these employees serve at will and may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time 
if our management team is unable to work effectively together to accomplish our business objectives  our ability to grow our business could be severely impaired 
a slowing economy and reductions in information technology spending may negatively affect our revenue 
our revenue may be negatively affected by the increasingly uncertain economic conditions both in the market generally and in our industry 
if the economy continues to slow  some companies may reduce their budgets for spending on information technology and business software 
as a consequence  our sales cycle may become longer with some customers  and other prospective customers may postpone  reduce  or even forego the purchase of our products and services  which could negatively affect our revenues 
we depend on increased business from new customers  and if we fail to grow our client base or generate repeat or expanded business  our operating results could be harmed 
if we fail to grow our client base or generate repeat and expanded business from our current and future clients  our business and operating results will be seriously harmed 
in some cases  our customers initially make a limited purchase of our products and services 
these clients may not choose to purchase additional licenses to expand their use of our products 
these clients have not yet developed or deployed initial applications based on our products 
if these clients do not successfully develop and deploy these initial applications  they may choose not to purchase deployment licenses or additional development licenses 
our business model generally depends on the expanded use of our products within our customers organizations 
in addition  as we introduce new versions of our products or new products  our current customers may not require the functionality of our new products and may not ultimately license those products 
because the total amount of maintenance and support fees we receive in any period depends in large part on the size and number of licenses that we have previously sold  any downturn in our license revenue would negatively affect our future services revenue 
in addition  if clients elect not to renew their maintenance agreement  our services revenue could decline significantly 
further  some of our customers are internet based companies  which have been forced to significantly reduce their operations in light of limited access of sources of financing and current economic slowdown 
if customers are unable to pay for their current products or are unwilling to purchase additional products  our revenues would decline 
we may lose existing customers or be unable to attract new customers if we do not develop new products 
if we are not able to improve our product line and develop new products that keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments  satisfy diverse and evolving customer requirements and achieve market acceptance  we may lose existing customers or be unable to attract new customers 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing new versions  other product enhancements or new products that respond to technological advances by others on a timely or cost effective basis  or that these products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
these delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forego purchases of our products to purchase those of our competitors 
our markets are highly competitive and competition could harm our ability to sell products and services and reduce our market share 
competition could seriously harm our ability to sell additional software and maintenance and support renewals on prices and terms favorable to us 
additionally  if we cannot compete effectively  we may lose market share 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
we compete against providers of decision support software  data warehousing software and enterprise application software 
we also compete with providers of e business software  which allows for the electronic delivery of products and services that enable commerce among businesses and end users 
companies in each of these areas may expand their technologies or acquire companies to support greater enterprise intelligence functionality and capability  particularly in the areas of query response time and the ability to support large numbers of users 
we may also face competition from vendors of products and turnkey solutions for e business applications that include internet based information functionality 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
we need to attract  train and retain additional qualified personnel in a competitive employment market 
our success depends on our ability to attract  train and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel  particularly in the market segment in which we compete 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel  or to attract  train and retain additional qualified personnel  we may experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and sell our products and perform services for our customers 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in april  and has experienced a significant decline since the first quarter of we have relied historically on our ability to attract employees using equity incentives  and any perception by potential and existing employees that our equity incentives are less attractive could harm our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we rely on marketing  technology and distribution relationships that may generally be terminated at any time  and if our current and future relationships are not successful  our growth may be limited 
we rely on marketing and technology relationships with a variety of companies that  in part  generate leads for the sale of our products 
these marketing and technology relationships include relationships with system integrators and consulting firms  vendors of e commerce and internet software  vendors of software designed for customer relationship management or for management of organizations operational information  vendors of key technology and platforms  demographic data providers  and an application service provider and an internet hoster 
if we cannot maintain successful marketing and technology relationships or cannot enter into additional marketing and technology relationships  we may have difficulty expanding the sales of our products and our growth may be limited 
if we lose key licenses we may be required to develop or license alternatives which may cause delays or reductions in sales 
we rely on software that we have licensed from opalis sa to perform key functions of our sagent automation product that automates common tasks in managing data 
we also rely on software we have licensed from microsoft corporation to allow users to be able to customize the user interface provided by our sagent design studio product 
these licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of either of these licenses could result in delays or reductions of shipments of our product suite until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated 
if customers require the automation and or the user interface customization features when licenses for either of those is not available  they may delay or decline to purchase our product suite 
failure of commercial users to accept internet solutions could limit our future growth 
a key element of our strategy is to offer users the ability to access  analyze and report information from a data server through a web browser 
our growth would be limited if businesses do not accept internet solutions or perceive them to be cost effective 
continued viability of the internet depends on several factors  including third parties abilities to develop new enabling technologies in a timely manner the internet s ability to handle increased activity the internet s ability to operate as a fast  reliable and secure network potential changes in government regulation moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including data corruption  cost  ease of use  accessibility and quality of service  remain unresolved and may negatively affect commerce and communication on the internet 
these issues will need to be addressed in order for the market for our products and services to grow 
customer satisfaction and demand for our products will depend on our ability to expand our professional services group  which assists our customers with the implementation of our products 
we believe that growth in our product sales depends on our ability to provide our customers with professional services to assist with support  training  consulting and initial implementation of our products and to educate third party systems integrators in the use of our products 
as a result  we plan to increase the number of professional services personnel to meet these needs 
new professional services personnel will require training and take time to reach full productivity 
we may not be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of highly qualified professional services personnel 
competition for qualified professional services personnel with the appropriate knowledge is intense 
we are in a new market and there is a limited number of people who have the necessary skills 
to meet our customers needs for professional services  we may also need to use more costly third party consultants to supplement our own professional services group 
in addition  we could experience delays in recognizing revenue if our professional services group falls behind schedule in connecting our products to customers systems and data sources 
we have expanded our international operations but may encounter a number of problems in managing overseas operations which could limit our future growth 
we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products and services internationally 
our failure to manage our international operations effectively could limit the future growth of our business 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  we conduct our international sales through local subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  france  japan  brazil  and canada and through distributor relationships in  benelux  south africa and eight pacific rim countries 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources to hire international sales personnel 
localizing our products is difficult and may take longer than we anticipate due to difficulties in translation and delays we may experience in recruiting and training international staff 
in addition  we currently have limited experience in developing local versions of our products  as well as marketing  selling and supporting our products and services overseas 
we have been  and may be subject to future  intellectual property infringement claims 
we may be subject  from time to time  to claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be costly to defend or settle  and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
in december we settled an infringement claim brought by timeline  inc under the terms of the settlement  we paid timeline  and issued  shares of our common stock to timeline 
we may subject to similar or more costly claims in the future or may become subject to an injunction against use of our products 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  this inability could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be harmed 
other software providers could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization 
they also could develop similar technology independently which may infringe our proprietary rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose a competitive position in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we do not keep pace with technological change our product may be rendered obsolete and our business may fail 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and enhancements and emerging industry standards 
in order to achieve broad customer acceptance  our products must be compatible with major software and e commerce applications and operating systems 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in these applications and systems 
internet selling system technology is complex and new products enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
if our products were to be incompatible with a popular new systems or applications  our business would be significantly harmed 
in addition  the development of entirely new technologies replacing existing software could lead to new competitive products that have better performance or lower prices than our products and could render our products obsolete 
we have recently issued a large number of shares of our common stock  and the sale of these shares could cause our stock price to decline 
during the first quarter of  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in private transactions 
we issued  shares of our common stock to timeline  inc  in settlement of litigation   shares of our common stock to eglobal technology services limited in exchange for an additional equity interest in sagent asia pacific pte ltd  and  shares of our common stock to investors in a private placement at a price per share of 
in connection with the private placement  we also issued to certain placement agents warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of 
we are under an obligation to file registration statements under the securities act of covering the sale of all of the foregoing shares 
we expect to file such registration statements in april if these stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common in the public market following this offering  the market price of our common stock could fall 
if our stock price declines further  there is a risk that we may be delisted by nasdaq 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq national market  which has certain compliance requirements for continued listing of common stock 
if the minimum closing bid price per share is less than for a period of consecutive business days  our shares may be delisted following a day notice period during which the minimum closing bid price must be or above per share for a period of consecutive business days  if we do not file an appeal 
as of the close of business on april   our common stock closed at a minimum bid price per share of 
the result of delisting from the nasdaq national market would be a reduction in the liquidity of any investment in our common stock 
delisting would reduce the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically 
this lack of liquidity would make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
enterprise intelligence software markets may not grow 
since all of our revenue are attributable to the sale of enterprise intelligence software and related maintenance  consulting and training services  if the market for enterprise intelligence software does not grow  our business will not grow 
we expect enterprise intelligence software and services to account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
although demand for enterprise intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market may not continue to grow or  even if the market does grow  businesses may not adopt our products 
we are focusing our selling efforts on large  enterprise wide implementations of our products  and we expect such sales to constitute an increasing portion of any future revenue growth 
while we have devoted significant resources to promoting market awareness of our products and the problems such products address  we do not know whether these efforts will be sufficient to support significant growth in the market for enterprise intelligence products 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california s current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below certain critical levels  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our california facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in by the california government has caused power prices to increase 
under deregulation  utilities were encouraged to sell their plants  which traditionally had produced most of california s power  to independent energy companies that were expected to compete aggressively on price 
instead  due in part to a shortage of supply  wholesale prices have skyrocketed over the past year 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  the operating expenses associated with our facilities are located in california will likely increase  which would harm our results of operations 
our acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value 
we may make investments in or acquire complementary companies  products and technologies 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s operations 
in addition  we may be unsuccessful in retaining the key personnel of the acquired company 
moreover  we currently do not know and cannot predict the accounting treatment of any such acquisition  in part because we cannot be certain what accounting regulations  conventions or interpretations may prevail in the future 
if we acquire complementary technologies or products  we could experience difficulties assimilating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders  and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
failure of commercial users to accept internet solutions could limit our future growth 
a key element of our strategy is to offer users the ability to access  analyze and report information from a data server through a web browser 
our growth would be limited if businesses do not accept internet solutions or perceive them to be cost effective 
continued viability of the internet depends on several factors  including third parties abilities to develop new enabling technologies in a timely manner  the internet s ability to handle increased activity  the internet s ability to operate as a fast  reliable and secure network  and potential changes in government regulation  moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including data corruption  cost  ease of use  accessibility and quality of service  remain unresolved and may negatively affect commerce and communication on the internet 
these issues will need to be addressed in order for the market for our products and services to grow 
if we discover software defects we may have product related liabilities which may lead to loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance for our products 
our software products are internally complex and may contain errors  defects or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we test our products extensively prior to releasing them  however  in the past we have discovered software errors in some of our products after their introduction 
despite extensive testing  we may not be able to detect and correct errors in products or releases before commencing commercial shipments  which may result in loss of revenue or delays in market acceptance 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
all domestic and international jurisdictions may not enforce these limitations 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we may encounter such claims in the future 
product liability claims  whether or not successful  brought against us could divert the attention of management and key personnel and could be expensive to defend 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  other agreements and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer that it did not feel was in the strategic interests of our company 
if the acquirer was discouraged from offering to acquire us  or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by the anti takeover measures  you could lose the opportunity to sell your shares at a favorable price 
we do not intend to pay dividends and you may not experience a return on investment without selling shares 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock 
therefore  you will not experience a return on your investment in our common stock without selling your shares since we currently intend on retaining future earnings to fund our growth and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors that may affect results beginning on page interest rate risk at december   we had cash totaling million  compared to million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  therefore  we believe we are not currently exposed to significant interest rate risk 
in  we entered into a million line of credit agreement with a bank collateralized by our assets 
advances against the revolving line bear interest at the bank s prime rate  plus 
although we have no outstanding balance under the line of credit  we may borrow under the line in the future 
if we do so and market interest rates rise  then our interest payments would increase accordingly 
foreign currency exchange rate risk substantially all of our revenue recognized to date has been denominated in us dollars and a significant portion of which has been realized outside of the united states 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
equity price risk we do not own any significant public equity investments 
therefore  we believe we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
