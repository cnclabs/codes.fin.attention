overview we are a leading provider of broadband wireless access equipment used by telecommunications service providers to provide businesses with high speed voice and data access 
we were incorporated in and introduced our first product  the airman system  in the airman system was designed to provide a dedicated link to connect two high traffic nodes in a network 
we discontinued airman in september none of our revenues  approximately of our revenues and of our revenues were derived from sales of the airman system 
we began development of a second system  the airstar system  in currently  all of our revenues are derived from sales of the airstar system 
unlike the airman system  the airstar system allows multiple subscribers to communicate with a single hub radio in a point to multipoint architecture using packet based technology 
the airstar system is comprised of two principal components customer premise equipment  which includes an outdoor radio unit which sends and receives signals to and from the hub equipment and an indoor unit  which connects to the end user s telecommunications and or data network  and hubs  which include several outdoor radio units that send and receive signals from multiple customer premise equipment units and an indoor unit  which aggregates data from the outdoor units and interfaces to the telecommunications service provider s core network 
we began initial sales of an early airstar system in europe in early since then  we have increased our product offering to encompass multiple frequencies thereby expanding our geographic coverage to include latin america  north america and asia 
as of december   we had deployed our equipment with customers in countries 
we sell our products indirectly through worldwide system integrators and local resellers in addition to through a direct sales force 
our sales to system integrators comprised approximately  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
due to ongoing realignments of our relationships with certain of our system integrator partners we expect this percentage to decline in which will require us to improve and expand our internal sales  customer advocacy and administration functions 
as a result of these realignments we could experience further order delays or fail to secure expected additional orders and  therefore  revenues in the first quarter of could be adversely affected 
sales to our largest system integrator customer represented approximately of our total revenues in due to changes in ordering practices by this customer in late  significant orders expected in the last quarter of were delayed  causing our revenues and results of operations to be lower than market expectations for that period 
because of these changes in ordering practices  we believe that our revenues for the first quarter of will be lower than our revenues for the last quarter of sales to our largest three customers represented approximately of our total revenues in sales to our four largest customers represented approximately of our total revenues in due to the nature and size of our equipment sales  we expect that certain customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for and in the future 
international revenues represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
however  substantially all of our domestic revenues are related to products sold to systems integrators which the system integrators have resold  or plan to resell  to end customers in international locations 
we have adopted a strategy of outsourcing our manufacturing operations 
while we have manufactured a small fraction of our products at our san jose headquarters in  and early  by the fourth quarter of  we achieved a goal of outsourcing substantially all of our volume product manufacturing and assembly to contract manufacturers 
we will maintain a small facility for prototype production in support of our research and development efforts 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
current revenues primarily consist of product revenues from the sale of the airstar system 
revenues increased to million in from million in  due principally to increased airstar system sales 
substantially all of the revenues for these years were generated from installations in international locations 
sales to major customers were as follows of total revenues revenues in thousands imed link  lucent   ntl  aggregate amount from or greater customers   sales less than gross profit 
gross profit represents total revenues less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of contract manufacturing costs  material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty reserves and other direct product costs 
gross profit increased to million in from million in  due to increased unit sales of the airstar product 
gross profit increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in this increase principally reflects the impact of cost reduction 
we have experienced substantial quarterly fluctuations in gross profit in and after excluding the effect of one time charges 
the principal drivers of the quarterly fluctuations were the product sales mix and customer sales mix 
in general  customer premise equipment sales result in lower gross profit percentages than hub sales 
we expect the sales of customer premise equipment to continue to increase at a rate faster than hub sales  resulting in reduced gross profit percentages during the first half of as compared with the first half of sales to system integrators generate lower gross profit percentages than sales to direct customers 
in addition  we expect average selling prices for our products to decline substantially during to the extent that we are unable to reduce our product costs at a rate faster than the rate at which average selling prices decline  gross profit as a percentage of revenues will continue to decline during the second half of we expect that the introduction of new customers  channel mix  product mix and declining average selling prices will result in fluctuations in our gross profits in future quarters 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of compensation costs  the cost of some software development tools  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increases in personnel and related compensation costs  prototype material expenses  third party engineering charges and expenses related to the release of new product features for the airstar system  and  to a lesser extent  the establishment of bungee communications  inc as a research and development subsidiary based in israel 
we expect that continued substantial investment in research and development will be critical to attaining our strategic product and cost reduction objectives and  therefore  we expect research and development costs to increase on a dollar basis in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  commissions  travel and related expenses for marketing  sales  customer advocacy and field service support personnel  as well as product management  trade show and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the significant expansion in sales  technical assistance and field support personnel necessary to support both the pre sale and post sale activities associated with the airstar system 
we expect these expenses to continue to increase on an absolute basis as we invest in expanding our sales and customer advocacy organizations and as the percentage of our sales to systems integrators declines 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs and related expenses for executive  finance  management information systems  human resources and administrative personnel 
these expenses also include professional fees  facilities and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increases in personnel and related compensation costs  increased cost associated with being a public company and increased reserves associated with higher revenues 
we expect that the growth of our operations as well as the increase in direct sales activity will continue to require additional personnel and costs 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation results from the granting of stock options to employees with exercise prices per share determined to be below the estimated fair values per share of our common stock at dates of grant 
the deferred compensation that results is being amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the individual options  generally four years 
we have recorded total deferred stock compensation of million through december  amortization of deferred stock compensation was million for and other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on low risk  marketable securities and interest paid on outstanding debt 
other income  net increased to million in from  in primarily due to higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances 
net loss 
net loss decreased to million in from million in principally due to higher interest income and gross profit  offset in part by increased operating expenses 
income taxes 
we have incurred a net loss for each period since inception 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates through due to the uncertainty of future profitability  a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded 
certain changes in ownership resulting from the sales of common stock will limit the future annual realization of the tax net operating loss carry forwards 
we have paid no material income taxes to date 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in  due principally to increased airstar system sales  which were slightly offset by the final phase out of airman sales 
substantially all of the revenues for these years were generated from installations in international locations 
sales to major customers were as follows of total revenues revenues in thousands alpine energie  imed link  lucent  ntl  pele phone siemens aggregate amount from or greater customers   sales less than gross profit loss 
gross profit increased to a profit of million in from a loss of million in  principally due to increased airstar system sales  which typically have a higher margin than predecessor products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increases in personnel and related compensation costs  prototype material expenses  third party engineering charges and expenses related to the release of new product features for the airstar system 
gross research and development expenses which reflect expenses prior to the effect of third party research and development funding increased to million in from million in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the significant expansion in sales  technical assistance and field support personnel necessary to support both the pre sale and post sale activities associated with the airstar system 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to deferred compensation charges  increased rent and overhead expenses associated with additional facilities  as well as the increased cost associated with being a public company 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation results from the granting of stock options to employees with exercise prices per share determined to be below the estimated fair values per share of our common stock at dates of grant 
the deferred compensation that results is being amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the individual options  generally four years 
we have recorded total deferred stock compensation of million through december  amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in other income  net 
other income  net increased to  in from  in primarily due to higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances partially offset by increased interest expense resulting from greater utilization of secured equipment loans and lease and bank financing for working capital 
net loss 
net loss was relatively constant at million from to principally due to higher gross profit  offset by increased operating expenses 
income taxes 
we have incurred a net loss for each period since inception and have paid no material income taxes to date 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million  short term marketable securities were million and long term marketable securities were million 
we have a million bank line of credit 
as of december   borrowings outstanding were million and amounts utilized for outstanding letters of credit were  under the bank line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by eligible outstanding accounts receivable and inventory 
the borrowings under the line are due in january and accrue interest at the day libor plus or the bank s prime rate  at our option 
the day libor rate at december  was and the bank s prime rate at december  was 
capital lease obligations were million at december  operating lease obligations through were  at december  cash used in operating activities was million in due to increases in inventory  prepaid expenses and the net loss 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net loss  partially offset by non cash charges 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to excess cash invested in marketable securities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to excess cash invested in short term marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for both periods was primarily due to issuances of stock and  to a lesser extent  capital lease and bank financing 
cash provided by financing activities in and includes net proceeds of million and million related to our follow on offering in march and our initial public offering in august  respectively 
in march we completed a follow on public offering 
of the six million shares of common stock offered  we sold  shares and selling shareholders sold  at a price of per share 
we received net aggregate proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs 
the capital required for volume manufacturing is being committed by our contract manufacturers 
we provide six or twelve month forecasts to our contract manufacturers 
we generally commit to purchase products to be delivered within the most recent days covered by these forecasts with cancellation fees 
as of december   we had committed to make purchases totaling million from these manufacturers in the next days 
in addition  in specific instances we may agree to assume liability for limited quantities of specialized components with lead times beyond this day period 
we have no other material commitments 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of research and product development efforts and expansion of our marketing efforts 
we expect to continue to expend significant but smaller amounts on property and equipment related to the expansion of our facilities  and on laboratory and test equipment for research and development 
in future periods  we generally anticipate significant increases in our working capital needs on a period to period basis 
in preparation for potential increases in revenues  we expect higher levels of inventory and trade accounts receivable 
while we also expect an increase in trade accounts payable and other liabilities  we do not expect that they will offset the increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable 
if revenues do not increase  the impact on working capital would be increased 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balances  marketable securities and funds available under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our management intends to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade marketable securities 
accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board issued financial standards board interpretation no

fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no

this bulletin summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the us to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company adopted sab effective january the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires companies to value derivative financial instruments  including those used for hedging foreign currency exposures  at current market value with the impact of any change in market value being charged against earnings in each period 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
to defer the effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after june  to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instrument contracts 
thus  the company anticipates that sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects and may cause our actual future business  results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from forward looking statements made in this report 
we have a history of losses  including more significant than expected losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal  expect future losses and may never achieve profitability as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  and we expect to continue to incur net losses 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve profitability 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
our financial results prior to were largely based on sales of airman  a predecessor product  which we discontinued in september for and  our financial results were largely based on customer trials and commercial pilots of our airstar product line 
although our airstar revenues have grown in recent quarters  our past results should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
even if we ultimately do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  if we fail to reduce our product costs quickly enough  or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business will be harmed 
if we cannot reduce our reliance on a single customer for most of our revenues  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have become increasingly dependent on lucent  which is a system integrator  for most of our revenues 
aggregate revenues from lucent accounted for approximately and of our revenues for and  respectively 
our own revenue expectations from lucent were not met when lucent did not complete an order of our products within the timeframe we had anticipated 
thus  due to our dependence on lucent  we experienced and could continue to suffer business and financial setbacks  miss analysts expectations of revenue or earnings levels and experience a decline in our stock price 
in particular  due to changes in ordering practices at lucent  described below  we believe that our revenues for the first quarter of could be lower than our revenues for the last quarter of lucent recently announced several corporate restructuring initiatives 
as a result of these initiatives  the division with which we have historically coordinated our efforts within lucent was shut down 
we are unsure what impact this will have on the promotion and sale by lucent of our products 
furthermore  this will require us to establish direct relationships with lucent s regional sales teams 
we cannot be assured of our ability to establish these relationships 
to the extent that lucent stops promoting or selling our products or we are unable to establish effective relationships with lucent s regional sales teams  our results and business will suffer 
finally  as a result of this transition  we will be required to develop many internal functions which have historically been provided to us by lucent  which could result in increased operating expenses or an inability to properly serve potential customers while we develop these skills 
there are a limited number of system integrators that have the financial resources or technical expertise to sell  integrate and service our products globally 
we do not have exclusive relationships with any of our system integrators and we do not require minimum purchase commitments 
therefore  if any of our system integrators ceases to emphasize systems that include our products  chooses to focus on alternative technologies or promotes products of our competitors  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we cannot reduce our product costs  our results of operations will suffer we expect that the average selling price for broadband wireless access equipment will decline substantially during in addition  market acceptance of our products will depend in part on reductions in the unit price of our products 
if we cannot reduce the cost of our products enough to keep pace with the required price reductions  our product sales and or our gross margins  and consequently our results of operations  will suffer 
we have experienced significant delays in implementing cost reductions in the past and may continue to experience delays in the future 
in addition  we believe that the price for high speed wireless telecommunications equipment is driven by the prevailing price for other high speed connection technologies  especially the cost of leasing a t connection from the traditional telecommunications service provider in a given locale 
the price of these leased connections has declined significantly in many countries in the recent past  and could decline significantly in the future 
if this trend continues  service providers might be more likely to use this kind of leased connection than to introduce new technology such as our products  which would adversely affect our market share and pricing 
if we do not succeed in developing relationships directly with telecommunications service providers and in strengthening our direct and indirect sales channels  our business will be harmed 
we believe that it is important to our ultimate success to decrease our focus on selling to systems integrators and to develop a sales and customer advocacy infrastructure that deals directly with the ultimate customer  the telecommunications service provider 
if we do not develop these direct contacts with and sales to the service providers  we will not be able to diversify and expand our customer base and will continue to depend on indirect sales through systems integrators 
in addition  failure to develop these contacts would prevent us from building and maintaining the long term relationships needed to sustain our installed customer base 
our relationships with our current service provider customers must also be maintained and strengthened so that we can provide potential service provider customers with positive customer references 
furthermore  if we are unable to expand our business with current service provider customers as they extend their networks into other countries  our business will be harmed 
in order to develop these relationships  we need to increase the size of our direct sales and customer advocacy organizations 
qualified personnel are difficult to find and training these personnel requires a significant time commitment 
it may take a substantial amount of time for new personnel to become productive 
to the extent we are unable to expand our direct sales force and customer advocacy organizations  we will not be able to accomplish our goal of developing and maintaining long term relationships with service providers 
the majority of service providers using our products are emerging companies with unproven business models 
if these service providers do not succeed  there will be a more limited market for our products most telecommunications service providers using our products are emerging companies with unproven business models 
if these new service providers do not succeed  there will be only a limited market for our products 
many of the service providers are under capitalized and will require additional capital or vendor financing to continue operations 
furthermore  the availability of capital to these service providers has been substantially limited in the last six months 
the inability of emerging service providers to acquire and keep customers  acquire radio frequency licenses  successfully raise needed funds or respond to any trends such as price reductions for their services or diminished demand for telecommunications services generally  could cause them to reduce their capital spending on network buildouts 
if service providers defer or curtail their capital spending programs  sales of our products might be impacted  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
many projects that include our products require system integration expertise and third party financing  which we are unable to provide 
if sources for system integration or financing cannot be obtained as needed  service providers may not select our products some service providers using our products purchase them as a part of a larger network deployment program that can require capital expenditures in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
in some circumstances  these service providers require their equipment vendors to integrate equipment into these larger networks and finance deployment 
we will be unable to provide this integration or financing and therefore will have to rely on the ability of our system integrators or third parties to integrate or finance these transactions 
in the event that we are unable to identify distributors and system integrators that are able to provide this integration or financing on our behalf  we would be unable to compete for the business of some service provider accounts and our business might be adversely affected 
intense competition in the market for communications equipment could prevent us from increasing or sustaining revenues or achieving or sustaining profitability the market for high speed  wireless  point to multipoint telecommunications equipment is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  shorter product life cycles  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which would adversely affect our business 
as a provider of high speed wireless telecommunications equipment  we compete with a number of large telecommunications equipment suppliers including alcatel  ericsson  hughes  marconi  and nortel  as well as with smaller independent and start up companies 
as a technology for providing high speed telecommunications services  high speed wireless solutions compete with other high speed wire based solutions  such as digital subscriber lines  fiber optic cable  cable modems  t lines leased from traditional telecommunications service providers and satellite technologies 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technical  manufacturing and other resources and more established distribution channels 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and financing of their products than we can 
our competitors may also attempt to influence the adoption of standards that are not compatible with our current architecture 
our larger  more established competitors may have more influence with standards setting bodies than we do 
if standards other than ours are adopted  this may require us to incur additional development and integration costs and may delay our sales efforts 
some of our competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to increase their ability to gain customer market share rapidly 
these competitors may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less expensive  provide higher performance or additional features or be introduced earlier than our solutions 
we also expect that other companies may enter our market with better products and technologies 
if any technology that is competing with ours is more reliable  faster or less expensive or has other advantages over our technology  then the demand for our products and services would decrease  which would seriously harm our business 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that may supplant or provide lower cost alternatives to our products 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult to predict future operating results or our stock price we have generated only limited revenues to date  and revenues from our current airstar product have been significant only in the past two years 
prior to  most of our revenues came from sales of a discontinued product line 
due to our limited operating history with our current product line  it is difficult for us to predict future results of operations 
investors in our common stock must consider our operational and financial prospects in light of our historical dependence on a discontinued product line 
we have a long sales cycle  which could cause our results of operations and stock price to fluctuate our sales cycles are long and unpredictable 
as a result  our revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and fail to correspond with our expenses 
this would cause our operating results and stock price to fluctuate 
system integrators and service providers typically perform numerous tests and extensively evaluate products before incorporating them into networks 
the time required for testing  evaluation and design of our products into the service provider s network typically ranges from six to twelve months 
if a service provider decides to supply commercial service with our products  it can take an additional six to twelve months before a service provider commences deployment of our products 
some additional factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include testing and evaluation  acquisition of roof rights  deployment and planning of network infrastructure  complexity of a given network  scope of a given project  availability of radio frequency  and regulatory issues 
in addition  the delays inherent in our sales cycle raise additional risks of service provider decisions to cancel or change their product plans 
our business is adversely affected when a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to deploy networks incorporating our products 
for example  order delays by one of our customers in the last quarter of caused our revenues and results of operations to be lower than market expectations 
we may purchase significant inventory for planned sales which do not materialize in future periods  we generally anticipate significant increases in our working capital needs due to planned revenue increases 
in anticipation of these expected revenues  we may purchase significant amounts of inventory and incur significant payment obligations 
due to the long and unpredictable nature of our sales cycle or other factors outside of our control  these anticipated future revenues may not materialize 
if the anticipated revenues do not materialize  we could end up with inventory levels significantly in excess of our needs  which could diminish our working capital and or cause significant losses 
we experienced such an excess of inventory in the fourth quarter of as a result of lower than expected revenues during that period 
our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation  be costly to correct  expose us to litigation and harm our operating results 
we and our customers have from time to time discovered defects in our products and additional defects may be found in the future 
if defects are discovered  we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or at all 
defects and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or a delay in  market acceptance of our products 
in addition  defects in our products could cause adverse publicity  damage our reputation and impair our ability to acquire new customers 
in addition  we may need to make significant capital expenditures to eliminate defects from our products 
moreover  because our products are used in critical telecommunications networks  we may be subject to significant liability claims if our products do not work properly 
the provisions in our agreements with customers that are intended to limit our exposure to liability claims may not preclude all potential claims 
in addition  any insurance policies we have may not adequately limit our exposure with respect to such claims 
we warrant to our current customers that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to these specifications  our customers could require us to remedy the failure or could assert claims for damages 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages 
any such claims  whether or not successful  would be costly and time consuming to defend and could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
our future operating results are dependent on the sales of a single product line 
if there are unexpected reductions in revenues from this product  we will not have other products to offset the negative impact on our operating results we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from our airstar product line and expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future 
if there are unexpected changes in revenues from this product  we will not have other products to offset the negative impact on our operating results 
many of the risk factors listed in this section could negatively affect sales of our product line 
the market may not continue to demand our current product and we may not be successful in developing or marketing any new or enhanced products 
any reduction in the demand for our current product or our failure to successfully develop or market and introduce new or enhanced products could adversely affect our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our business is subject to many factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our stock price to be volatile our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our quarterly or annual operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline 
some of the factors that could affect our quarterly or annual operating results include the timing and amount of  or cancellation or rescheduling of  orders for our products  particularly large orders from system integrators  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements  new product introductions and reductions in price of products offered by our competitors  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to achieve cost reductions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products  our ability to achieve and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  the volume of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  the loss of any one of our major customers or a significant reduction in orders from those customers  increased competition  particularly from larger  better capitalized competitors  fluctuations in demand for our products and services  and telecommunications and wireless market conditions and economic conditions generally 
due in part to factors such as the timing of product release dates  purchase orders and product availability  significant volume shipments of products could occur at the end of our fiscal quarter 
failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  in the fourth quarter of one of our principal customers restructured its purchasing procedures  which resulted in substantial delays of the purchase of our products and adversely affected our results of operations in that period 
in the future  our customers may delay delivery schedules or cancel their orders without notice 
due to these and other factors  quarterly revenue  expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we depend on contract manufacturers 
if these manufacturers are unable to fill our orders on a timely basis  and we are unable to find alternative sources  we may be unable to deliver products to meet customer orders we currently only manufacture prototypes of our products and perform testing and staging at our own facilities 
the remaining manufacturing is performed by contact manufacturers 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes  we would have to identify and train acceptable alternative manufacturers  which could take as long as six months and cause our results of operations to suffer 
our experience with these manufacturers provides us with no basis to project their delivery schedules  yields or costs 
in addition  few manufacturers produce radios like ours on a large scale 
it is possible that a source may not be available to us when needed  and we may not be able to satisfy our production requirements at acceptable prices and on a timely basis  if at all 
any significant interruption in supply would affect the allocation of products to customers  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  by outsourcing our manufacturing we are less able to control the quality of our finished products 
if we do not meet product introduction deadlines  our business will be harmed our inability to develop new products or product features on a timely basis  or the failure of new products or product features to achieve market acceptance  could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced design and manufacturing difficulties that have delayed our development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements which has caused us to incur unexpected expenses 
for example  the first trial shipments of airstar were delayed for almost one year due to technical problems 
in addition  some of our customers have conditioned their future purchases of our products on the addition of product features 
in the past we have experienced delays in introducing new features 
for example  we intended to introduce base radio units that supported smaller sectors and a new release of our network management software in  but the release of both of these features did not occur until the middle of we also cannot assure that we will be successful in our efforts to release product enhancements enabling significantly higher peak transmission rates than we currently offer 
furthermore  in order to compete in many markets  we will have to develop different versions of our existing products that operate at different frequencies and comply with diverse  new or varying governmental regulations in each market 
because some of our key components are from sole source suppliers or require long lead times  our business is subject to unexpected interruptions  which could cause our operating results to suffer many of our key components have long lead times  are purchased from sole source vendors for which alternative sources are not currently available  and are complex to manufacture 
in the event of a reduction or interruption of supply  or a degradation in quality  as many as six months could be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies from alternative suppliers  if any 
as a result  product shipments could be delayed and our revenues and results of operations would suffer 
if we receive a smaller allocation of component parts than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand  customers could choose to purchase competing products and we could lose market share 
for example  we purchase our base station shelf from cisco systems  inc under an agreement that terminates in june cisco has recently acquired interests in companies with high speed wireless technology  and we cannot be certain that cisco will continue to supply us after the termination of the current agreement 
in addition  we purchase most of our electronic boards for base station equipment from solectron  one of our contract manufacturers  and other components from other sole source and long lead time vendors 
if high speed wireless telecommunications technology or our implementation of this technology is not accepted by service providers  we will not be able to sustain or grow our business our future success is substantially dependent on whether high speed wireless telecommunications equipment gains market acceptance as a means to provide telecommunications voice and data services 
all of our products are based on this technology 
in the event that service providers adopt technologies other than the high speed wireless technology that we offer  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
service providers continuously evaluate alternative high speed access technologies  including wire based technologies such as digital subscriber lines  cable modems  fiber optic cable and t connections leased from the traditional service providers in a given locale  as well as different wireless technologies 
in addition  widespread acceptance of our technology may be hindered by inherent technological limitations  such as a need for a clear line of sight for transmissions and a reduction in coverage radius in areas that experience heavy rain 
because we must sell our products in many countries that have different regulatory schemes  if we cannot develop products that work with different standards  we will be unable to sell our products if our sales are to grow  we must sell our products in many different countries 
many countries require communications equipment used in their country to comply with unique regulations  including safety regulations  radio frequency allocation schemes and standards 
if we cannot develop products that work with different standards  we will be unable to sell our products 
if compliance proves to be more expensive or time consuming than we anticipate  our business would be adversely affected 
some countries have not completed their radio frequency allocation process and therefore we do not know the standards with which we would be forced to comply 
we have not completed all activities necessary to comply with existing regulations and requirements in most of the countries in which we intend to sell our products 
furthermore  standards and regulatory requirements are subject to change 
if we fail to anticipate or comply with these new standards  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to manage our international operations effectively  our business would be adversely affected sales of products which were ultimately deployed internationally accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
in addition  most equipment purchased by domestic customers has been shipped to international service providers 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially less effective protection of intellectual property  the difficulties and costs of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and legal uncertainties regarding liability  tax  tariffs and other trade barriers 
any of these factors could have an adverse impact on our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to expand into international markets 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products in particular markets from time to time  third parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
any claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  in our sales agreements  we agree to indemnify our customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
line of sight limitations inherent to broadband wireless products may limit deployment options and have an adverse affect on our sales 
broadband wireless products require a direct line of sight between antennas  potentially limiting the ability of our customers to deploy them in a cost effective manner 
because of line of sight limitations  service providers often install broadband wireless equipment on the rooftops of buildings and on other tall structures 
telecommunications service providers must generally secure roof rights from the owners of each building or other structure on which our products are installed 
any inability to obtain roof rights easily and cost effectively may cause a delay in deployment and increase the installation cost of our products or may cause customers not to choose to install broadband wireless equipment 
if we are unable to hire or retain our personnel  we might not be able to operate our business successfully the loss of the services of any key personnel or our inability to hire new personnel could restrict our ability to compete effectively 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry and in the silicon valley is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining these personnel 
there are only a limited number of people with the requisite skills  particularly people with millimeter wave radio expertise 
we are also dependent on the continued contributions of our principal sales  engineering and management personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we currently do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our key executives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues and operating expenses have not been material 
basically  all of our revenues are earned in us dollars 
operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated primarily in local currencies 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
fixed income investments 
our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates relates primarily to corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  all investments with maturities of three months or greater and less than one year are considered to be short term marketable securities  all investments with maturities greater than one year are considered to be long term marketable securities 
all investments are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity and consist of government and corporate debt securities 
the sec s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our investments in marketable securities 
all of our investments are in funds that hold investment grade commercial paper  treasury bills or other us government obligations 
this investment policy reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point decline in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized earnings on our million of marketable securities at december  by approximately million
