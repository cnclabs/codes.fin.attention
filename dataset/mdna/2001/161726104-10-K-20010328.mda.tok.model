inflation all of the leases or terms of tenants occupancies at the communities allow for at least annual rental adjustments

other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as consolidated net income of the company without giving effect to gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property and rental property depreciation and amortization 
management believes that ffo is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of reits  which provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  and iii is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is calculated as follows for the year ended december  in thousands income before minority interest      less income allocated to preferred op units    plus depreciation of rental property      amortization of intangibles gain on sales of properties  funds from operations      nareit has revised its definition of ffo 
the company adopted the new definition effective january  the new definition of ffo substantially eliminates the add back of the non recurring items in the calculation of ffo 
the application of this new definition decreased ffo in by  and had no effect on any other years reported 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level and taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity 
as of december   the company s credit facilities represented its only variable rate debt 
the following table sets forth information as of december   concerning the company s debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value fv for the year ended december  thereafter total fv debt obligations fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate total debt         the company faces market risk relating to its fixed rate debt upon re financing of such debt and depending upon prevailing interest rates at the time of such re finance 
as a result of the company s successful re financing and extension of its fixed rate debt  as illustrated in the above chart  it will not need to re finance any of its fixed rate debt until in addition  the company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a increase in libor rates would result in an approximate  increase in interest expense based on million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration
