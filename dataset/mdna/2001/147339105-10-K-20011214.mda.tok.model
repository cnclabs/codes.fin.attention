item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and a discussion of the principal factors that affect consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended september    and references herein to   and refer to these fiscal years 
earnings per share net income was  for  compared to  for basic and diluted earnings per share for were  a improvement over the reported for of the improved earnings  per share resulted from non recurring transactions 
there was a per share improvement resulting from one time revenue opportunities dealing with off system interstate pipeline capacity 
this was partially offset by per share from operating expenses related to the installation of a new integrated work management system 
excluding these one time transactions  basic and diluted earnings per share were  a improvement over versus fiscal net income represents a improvement over the  per common share reported for fiscal the improvement in earnings is primarily the result of operating margin increases that exceeded the increase in operating and other costs 
operating margin operating margin for the year improved million  with million attributed to growth in residential and commercial margin  million in one time revenue from off system interstate pipeline capacity transactions  offset by a net reduction of million in industrial and other margins 
residential and commercial margin for the fiscal years ended september    and are set forth in the table below months ended september in thousands degree days    average number of customers residential    commercial    average therm usage per customer residential commercial    operating margin residential    commercial    operating margins from sales to residential and commercial customers were up  or  in compared to the primary factors contributing to this improvement were increased deliveries to residential customers resulting from growth in the number of customers  and higher average consumption per commercial customer 
increases in the number of residential and commercial customers contributed approximately million and million respectively of new margin 
higher per customer gas usage  primarily by commercial customers  contributed most of the remaining improvement 
average consumption by residential customers in was the same as in despite the fact that weather was colder in this lack of increased consumption is attributed to rate increases in january  and general conservation efforts by customers in response to the west coast power crisis in the winter of versus fiscal operating margins from sales to residential and commercial customers were up  or  compared to the primary factors contributing to this improvement were increased deliveries to residential customers resulting from growth in the number of customers 
increases in the number of residential and commercial customers contributed approximately million and million respectively of new margin 
these improvements were partially offset by reductions in consumption per customer resulting from warmer than normal weather 
weather in  as measured by heating degree days  was approximately warmer than normal  and warmer than industrial and other margin 
total margin from industrial and other customers in declined  from increased consumption by electric generation customers resulted in a  margin increase from that sector  but this was offset by a million decline in margin from customers in other industries 
the energy crisis on the west coast during the winter and spring of was the major contributing factor in both these changes 
there has been increased demand for electric generation  but higher energy prices have driven decisions by other customers to reduce their consumption 
the company has also earned  of increased margins from providing gas management services to industrial customers  as well as providing miscellaneous services to existing and new customers 
other margin in was reduced by a charge resulting from the oregon earnings sharing mechanism 
under this arrangement between the company and the opuc  cascade refunds to its oregon customers one third of earnings that exceed a return on equity ceiling 
the amount recorded as an estimate attributable to is  capacity contracts 
during  the company benefited from one time opportunities to enter into two off system interstate pipeline transactions 
these transactions resulted in million of operating margin 
the company has no expectation of additional revenues from such sources  and this is not an on going part of cascade s business 
versus margins from industrial and other customers in increased million  or from approximately million of this improvement resulted from increased gas deliveries to electric generation customers 
increased demand for electricity was the main reason for this higher gas usage 
historically  gas consumption by  and margin from electric generation customers has been subject to significant volatility 
from to  annual margins from these customers varied from million to million 
additionally  approximately million in margins came from smaller  new industrial customers and about million resulted from consumption increases by other industrial customers 
cost of operations cost of operations  which consists of operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and property and payroll taxes  was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
operating expenses for  which are primarily labor and benefits expenses  increased  or from of this increase   is attributable to one time expenses related to the installation of a new integrated work management system 
excluding these one time costs  ongoing expenses increased for the year 
this increase was due in large part to increases in regular compensation  and in profit sharing related to achievement of goals 
versus operating expenses for increased  or from the net increase reflected changes in various categories of expense 
significant changes included a  decrease in labor expense related to reductions in the number of employees 
the average number of employees in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal these reductions were achieved through normal attrition 
employee benefits expense increased  mostly attributable to higher accruals for medical benefits costs 
the provision for uncollectible accounts increased  mostly due to establishing a reserve related to an account due from an industrial customer 
office and administrative expenses  including hiring costs  supplies  postage  and collection costs  increased  
purchased services expenses increased   and included  in fees paid related to mitigation of property tax increases 
services provided for those fees resulted in the avoidance of approximately  in annual property tax increases 
depreciation and amortization for increased  or over for the increase was  or over the increased depreciation expense each year is the result of new depreciable assets placed in service 
property and payroll taxes for increased  or over for  the increase was  or over for both years  the increase was primarily attributable to property tax increases related in large part to asset additions 
nonoperating expense income interest expense in  net of interest capitalized  decreased  from  mainly because of the interest benefit accrued on deferred gas costs 
other non operating income decreased  mainly because of lower interest income on deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
versus interest expense in  net of interest capitalized  increased  over fiscal because of higher average long term debt balances  and higher average balances of deferred gas cost accounts 
other non operating income increased  primarily from higher interest income on deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
income taxes the increase in the provision for federal and state income taxes in over  and in over is attributable to improvements in pre tax earnings 
other comprehensive income during  the value of the assets in the company s pension plan declined  reflecting the general downward trend in common stock values 
the decline in asset values resulted in an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
to recognize this liability  the company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
this adjustment included a  charge to other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income also includes a  credit for the income tax benefit resulting from the charge 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures 
increases in wholesale natural gas prices may also result in short term cash requirements to finance purchases of gas for resale to customers 
to provide working capital for these requirements  the company has a million bank revolving credit commitment 
this agreement has an annual commitment fee with a term that expires in the company also has million of uncommitted lines from three banks 
as of september   there was million outstanding under the committed and uncommitted lines 
to provide longer term financing  the company has registrations under the securities act of providing ability to issue up to million of new debt and equity securities 
of this amount  million of medium term notes is available for issuance under one registration statement 
the company has an omnibus registration  providing flexibility to issue million in new debt and equity securities 
on november   the company issued million new long term debt under the omnibus registration  leaving million available under that registration for future financing 
the million proceeds were used to replace outstanding short term debt 
operating activities for fiscal  operating activities resulted in a net use of cash of  compared to positive cash flow of  for this represents more than a million difference in operating cash flow between the two years 
this difference is due to higher costs of natural gas purchases not passed through to customers  but deferred 
for the year  under recovery of gas cost  including amortization of prior deferrals  was million 
in  there was an over recovery of million 
wholesale gas prices reached unprecedented high levels in the northwest during the winter heating season 
effective january   the wutc approved the company s request to increase customer rates to recover higher gas costs 
in its request to the wutc  the company chose to minimize the burden on customers  and not pass through all gas cost increases immediately 
the company experienced substantial under recoveries during the march quarter  but by the end of that quarter  wholesale prices had declined to a level roughly equivalent to the amount in customer rates 
the company has subsequently entered into agreements with its major suppliers to lock in prices for a three year period for most of its core supply requirements 
effective november   the wutc approved new rates for washington customers 
the new rates reflect a surcharge to recover the deferred gas cost charges over a three year period 
this arrangement is expected to add cash flow of approximately million per year for the three years  as well as stabilize rates for customers for that period 
investing activities cash used by investing activities in was  compared to  in investing activities are substantially all capital expenditures  which were million lower than budget for postponement of a major reinforcement project was the major factor in lower than budgeted expenditures 
contributing to the increase over was million spent to install a new integrated work management system 
budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal are approximately million  which includes million for new customer connections and distribution system reinforcement and replacement projects 
the remainder is for equipment  facilities upgrades  and various technology projects 
financing activities financing activities for provided  compared to a use of  for other than the payment of dividends  the primary financing activity in was the million increase in short term debt to fund operating activities and capital expenditures 
environmental matters in  the company received a claim from a property owner in eugene  oregon requesting that the company assume responsibility for investigation and possible clean up of alleged contamination on property previously owned by a predecessor of cascade 
the predecessor company conducted a manufactured gas business on the property from approximately to manufactured gas operations apparently were conducted on the site by several operators beginning about the site was used for other purposes beginning in the present owner has retained an environmental consultant  which is investigating possible contamination on the property 
to date the consultant has reported that it believes contamination is present 
the contamination is consistent with that which might originate from a manufactured gas operation 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the consultant s initial report has been furnished to the oregon department of environmental quality deq 
the owner has reached an intergovernmental agreement with the deq with respect to further investigation and possible remediation of contamination on the property under the voluntary cleanup program 
another northwest utility  which purchased the property from cascade in  has declined to participate in the site investigation  although it may  as a onetime owner of the property  bear some share of the responsibility as well 
the company has notified its insurance carriers of the claim and is keeping them advised as to the investigation 
on one occasion in the past when hazardous materials on property formerly owned by a predecessor of the company required clean up  the opuc allowed the clean up costs to be passed on to customers 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking for reimbursement through rates for such costs 
in  a property owner in washington notified the company that there is contamination on his property  and that he believes it comes from a former manufactured gas site  owned at one time by a predecessor company  which was merged with cascade in the state of washington department of ecology has categorized this site as a listed site ranked in its most hazardous category 
as a former owner of the site  the company may be strictly liable to the state of washington for investigation and remediation of the contamination of the site  but may share that cost or allocate all the cost to others who actually caused or contributed to the contamination 
the company retained an environmental consultant who conducted a preliminary investigation of possible contamination at the site 
there is evidence of contamination at the site  and there is also evidence of an oil line across the site property owned and operated by others  which may be a contributor to the contamination 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the company has investigated title and other government records to identify other potentially liable parties 
the company has notified the other identified parties of the contamination claims  and has requested cooperation and financial contribution 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking the wutc for reimbursement for such costs  through rates charged to customers

the company has fixed rate debt obligations  but does not have derivative financial instruments subject to interest rate risk 
cascade makes interest and principal payments on these obligations in the normal course of its business  and does not plan to redeem these obligations prior to normal maturities 
the company s natural gas purchase commodity prices are subject to fluctuations resulting from weather  congestion on interstate pipelines  and other unpredictable factors 
the company s pga mechanisms assure the recovery of prudently incurred wholesale gas cost  therefore management believes the company s commodity price risk is immaterial
