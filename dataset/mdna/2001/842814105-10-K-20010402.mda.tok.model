item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general as a whole  the manufactured housing industry has been adversely affected by various economic factors  and has struggled in the past several quarters 
the current situation in the manufactured housing industry is the result of many factors 
rapid industry growth over the past years resulted in an increase in the overall number of dealers  an increase in manufacturing output and an increase in the number of homes available at the retail level 
these larger inventories and the generally slower reduction of those inventories has led to increased price competition and reduced profits 
tightening credit and increasing interest rates have compounded the situation and negatively affected the industry s overall financial performance  with virtually all manufacturers and retailers being impacted 
southern energy homes has not been excluded from this group  however  the company has taken carefully planned steps designed to decrease costs and improve efficiency 
in and these steps included closing manufacturing facilities  consolidating divisions  and selling unprofitable retail centers 
management continues to monitor the situation and remains prepared to implement additional measures necessary to emerge financially sound from this industry downturn and are prepared to take advantage of any future opportunities presented by any increase in the demand for affordable housing 
management is confident in the long term future for the manufactured housing industry and southern energy homes  inc in light of current industry conditions  the company expects that there will be future declines in wholesale and retail revenues and related net profit margins  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and liquidity

substantially all of the company s independent dealers finance their purchases through floor plan arrangements under which a financial institution provides the dealer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral

capital expenditures the company does not currently plan to make any material capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on its sales or profitability 
the company has in the past been able to pass on most of the increases in its costs by increasing selling prices  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
increased competition in the industry has generally prevented the company from passing on such increases 
the following discussion about the company s interest rate risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk 
historically the company has not entered into derivatives contracts to either hedge existing risk or for speculative purposes 
the company also does not and has not entered into contracts involving derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
pertinent provisions of regulation s k call for disclosures to clarify exposures to market risk associated with activities in derivative financial instruments  other financials instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the regulation defines other financial instruments to include trade accounts receivable  loans and structured notes 
the company does not utilize derivative instruments to manage such risks 
the company s principal credit agreement bears a floating interest rate of over libor 
accordingly  the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
at september   million was outstanding under the credit agreement 
as of december   the principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement was million 
assuming that amount outstanding  a increase in the applicable interest rate during would result in additional interest expense of approximately  which would reduce cash flow and pre tax earnings dollar for dollar 
accounts receivable most of the company s sales of manufactured homes are pre sold  such that orders exist before construction begins 
when manufactured homes are sold to dealers as inventory  such homes are paid for by dealer s floor plan financing  such that funds ordinarily transfer to the company from the dealer s floor plan lender within days 
management thus does not perceive that the company is subject to a material market risk with respect to its accounts receivable
