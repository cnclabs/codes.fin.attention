item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this document  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan  and expect and similar expressions as they relate to us are included to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in this document 
overview we provide online learning courses and services  which we refer to as e learning solutions 
we were founded in april in fiscal  we invested in both course content development and research and development as we built our course offerings and technology  releasing our first course in the later part of fiscal since fiscal  we have made significant investments in content research and development  sales and marketing activities  technology research and development  web delivery  and customer support 
we have also experienced significant headcount increases during this period 
we grew from employees on march  to on march  to employees as of march  our revenues increased from  in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal sources of revenues and revenue recognition policy we deliver our e learning solutions through a catalog of existing courses and through customized content tailored to the specific needs of our customers 
we refer to the individuals taking courses as participants 
customized e learning courses have accounted for  and we expect will continue to account for  a significant portion of our total revenues 
we generate revenues by delivering courses included in our course catalog as well as delivering our customized e learning courses to participants 
customers that enter into delivered learning contracts provide participants with access to our online courses and tutor support 
additionally  customers are provided with access to learning management systems that allow them to track and monitor participants performance 
delivered learning contracts typically allow for a specific number of registered participants  based on a per participant fee 
these contracts also typically limit the period of time over which participants can register for and complete an online course 
we begin recognizing these delivered learning fees when a participant registers for a course 
these fees are recognized ratably over the time period a participant has access to the course  which is typically six months 
customers typically pay for the courses in advance of the anticipated timeframe of course registration and do not receive refunds for the unused portion of the available registrations agreed to in the contract 
in cases where we allow unlimited access to our courses for a specific period of time  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
we also derive revenues from contracts that require development of tailored e learning solutions 
typically  these learning solution service revenues are generated from performance consulting services  implementation services  course content development  instructional plan design  and release of the course for access by participants and are recognized as earned in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction production type contracts  as development progresses on the percentage of completion method 
we measure the percentage of completion based on the ratio of actual custom development or service costs incurred to date  to total estimated costs to complete the custom course or service 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts will be made on a contract by contract basis and recognized in the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  there have been no such losses 
custom contracts typically call for non refundable payments due upon achievement of certain milestones in the production of courses or in consulting services 
delivered learning fees and learning solution service revenues are each recognized only when collection is probable and there is evidence that we have completed our obligation 
if a contract includes both delivered learning fees and learning solution services  the revenues are apportioned consistent with the value associated with each and the term of the contract 
in all cases  these revenues are recognized in accordance with the policies detailed above 
we have entered into revenue sharing agreements with some of our customers and have certain reseller agreements 
under revenue sharing agreements  we receive royalties or similar payments based on sales of courses by the customer 
under reseller agreements  we provide the reseller with courses at a discount from our list price 
the reseller then assumes responsibility for sales  marketing  and related activities  and we would not expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses in connection with reseller sales 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to forecast future operating performance 
although our revenues have grown in recent quarters  this growth rate may not be sustainable 
in addition  we have never been profitable and expect to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future as we substantially increase our content research and development  technology research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we have experienced losses in each quarter since our inception and expect that our quarterly losses will continue at least through the next three quarters 
we expect that these losses will result in large part from our ongoing emphasis on course development and sales and marketing activities 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers and the percentage of our revenues from any one customer can be material 
sales to our largest customer comprised of our revenues in fiscal sales to our largest customer comprised of our revenues in fiscal in fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
stock based compensation deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price at the date of grant 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of  in fiscal and million in fiscal deferred stock compensation of million was recorded in fiscal in connection with an acquisition 
these amounts are amortized over the four year vesting period of the options using the multiple option approach 
stock based compensation expense of  was recorded during fiscal  million was recorded in fiscal and million was recorded in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net operating loss carryforwards from inception through march   we incurred net losses for federal and state income tax purposes and have not recognized any income tax provision or benefit 
as of march   we had million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
these net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state purposes  respectively 
given our limited operating history and losses incurred to date  coupled with difficulty in forecasting future results  a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
furthermore  as a result of changes in our equity ownership from our preferred stock offerings and initial public offering  utilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations 
this is due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the degree of any such limitation cannot presently be estimated 
to date  we have not performed an evaluation to determine if such a limitation exists  and we may not perform such an evaluation until and unless we are profitable in the future 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity prices 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors 
interest rate risk as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  consisting of cash and highly liquid short term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
additionally the company had marketable securities  classified as available for sale  with maturities greater than three months totaling million 
these investments may be subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates of from the market rates in effect at march  would cause the fair value of these investments to change by an immaterial amount 
declines in interest rates over time will result in lower interest income 
foreign currency and exchange rate risk almost all of our revenues recognized to date have been denominated in us dollars and are primarily from the united states 
however  an increasing portion of our future revenue may be derived from international customers 
revenues from these customers may be denominated in the local currency of the applicable countries 
as a result  our operating results could become subject to significant foreign currency fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  as we engage in business outside the united states  changes in exchange rates relative to the us dollar could make us less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our foreign currency exposure  and may use financial instruments to limit this exposure  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a materially negative impact on our business 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments
