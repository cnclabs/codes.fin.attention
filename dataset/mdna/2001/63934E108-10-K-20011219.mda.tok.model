the engine segment s profit decrease during was primarily the result of unfavorable sales mix 
the engine segment s profit and revenue increases in were partially attributable to record levels of engine shipments to other original equipment manufacturers oems 
results of operations continued the financial services segment s profit in decreased millio n from primarily due to lower gains on the sale of wholesale notes and lower average finance receivable balances  partially offse t by higher gains from marketable securities and higher average operating lease balances

shipments of mid range diesel engines by the company to other o ems during were  units  a increase over the  units shipped in  which represented a increase over inclusion of shipments of iesa was the primary cause for the higher shipments in higher shipments to ford motor company f ord to meet consumer demand for light trucks and vans which use this engine was the primary cause of the increase in finance and insurance revenue was million for  a million de crease from revenue of million  which was million higher than revenue of million

these obligations are generally recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are not discounted to their present value 
the company reviews its accrua ls on a regular basis and believes that  based on these calculations  its share of the potential additional costs for the cleanup of each site will not have a material effect on the company s financial results 
derivative financial instruments as disclosed in notes and to the financial statements  the company uses derivative financial instruments to transfer or reduce the risks of foreign exchange and interest rate volatility  and potentia lly increase the return on invested funds 
the company s manufacturing operations  as conditions warrant  hedge foreign exchange exposure on the purchase of parts and materials from foreign countries and its exposure from the sale of manufactured products in other countries 
contracted purchases of commodities or manufacturing equipment may also be hedged 
the financial services operations may use forward contracts to hedge int erest payments on the notes and certificates related to an expected sale of receivables 
the financial services operations also use interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate changes when they sell fixed rate receivables on a variable rate basis 
for th e protection of investors in nfc s securities  nfc may enter into interest rate caps when fixed rate receivables are sold on a variabl e rate basis

income taxes continued the deferred tax asset includes the tax benefits associated with c umulative tax losses of  million and temporary differences  which represent the cumulative expense of  million record ed in the statement of income that has not been deducted on the company s tax returns 
the valuation allowance at october   assumes that it is more likely than not that approximately million of cumulative tax losses will not be realized b efore their expiration date 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on the generation of approximately  mi llion of future taxable income 
until the company has utilized its significant net operating loss carryforwards  the cash payment o f us federal income taxes will be minimal 
see note to the financial statements

management reviews a ll available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company 
the financial res ults are evaluated using a number of alternatives in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
one significant facto r considered is the company s role as a leading producer of heavy and medium trucks and school buses and mid range diesel engines 
the income tax benefit in was increased by million for research an d development tax credits 
income tax expense in was reduced by million for research and development tax credits 
these t ax credits that will be taken against future income tax payments related to research and development activities that occurred over t he last several years 
in  as a result of increased industry demand  the continued successful implementation of the company s manufacturing strategies  changes in the company s operating structure  and other positive operating indicators  management re viewed its projected future taxable income and evaluated the impact of these changes on its deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
th is review was completed during the third quarter of and resulted in a reduction to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of signif icant market share  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of million

the company s us and canadian order backlog at october   was  units  compare d with  units at october  historically  retail deliveries have been impacted by the rate at which new truck order s are received

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest r ates and currency exchange rates 
the company is also exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used in its manufacturin g operations and to changes in the prices of equity instruments owned by the company 
commodity price risk related to the company s current commodity financial instruments and equity price risk related to the company s current investments in equity instrum ents are not material 
the company does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage sensitivi ty to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of the company s level of exposure to each market risk  the funding of variable rate receivables with variable rate debt  and limiting the amount of fixed ra te receivables  which may be funded with floating rate debt 
these procedures also include the use of derivative financial instrumen ts to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations and to reduce the exposure to exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the company measures its interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market int erest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse chang e in interest rates as of october  and  the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rate yield curves 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
foreign currency risk is the risk that the company will incur economic los ses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluct uations are the canadian dollar us dollar  mexican peso us dollar and brazilian peso us dollar 
at october  and  the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be approximately million and million  respectively 
the foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that all of the foreign currencies to which the company is exposed would simu ltaneously decrease by  because such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
the effects of foreign currency forward contr acts have been included in the above analysis  however  the sensitivity model does not include the inherent risks associated with the a nticipated future transactions denominated in foreign currency for which these forward contracts have been entered into for hedging p urposes
