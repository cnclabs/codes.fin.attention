possis medical  inc evaluates revenue performance based on the worldwide revenues of each major product line and profitability based on an enterprise wide basis due to shared infrastructures to make operating and strategic decisions 
the company generates revenue from the sale of its products 
the resulting cash flow  together with the net proceeds from the company s debt and equity offerings  has been used to fund the company s operations  including research and development related to its products

the angiojet system consists of a drive unit capital that powers a disposable pump and a family of disposable catheters  each aimed at a specific indication 
the main factors in the revenue increase were increased sales resulting from the company commencing us marketing of the angiojet system with additional labeling claims 
during fiscal and the company began us marketing of three new catheters for the removal of blood clots in leg peripheral arteries  the xmi tm in march  the xpeedior r in may and the lf in april in addition  the company received clearance to market the company s xpeedior catheter for removal of blood clots from dialysis access grafts in april as of july  the company had a total of domestic angiojet system drive units in the field  compared to and at the end of the previous two years 
during fiscal the company sold approximately  catheters and pump sets versus approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
this represents a and increase in unit catheters sales from the previous years 
during the fiscal years ended july   and the company sold  and angiojet system drive units  respectively 
the increase in angiojet system drive unit sales in fiscal from fiscal resulted from increase market penetration and the overall acceptance of the angiojet system by physicians 
the decrease in angiojet system drive unit sales in fiscal from fiscal was due to cost constraints at us hospitals related to the balanced budget reform act bba of the bba mandated the removal of billion from hospital operating budgets by the end of and billion by hospitals responded to this mandate by freezing or reducing expenditures in major cost centers such as the pharmacy  and by deferring purchases of capital equipment such as the angiojet system drive unit 
the extent of these cost constraints across hospitals and within departments of the same hospitals was not proportional  and depended on the unique revenue  cost and capital budget situation of the institution in question 
the company believes the bba had an adverse affect on its angiojet system drive unit sales and its competitors sales because of the pressure it put on hospitals to reduce expenditures 
however  the company does not have any data that allows it to calculate the amount of the adverse affect the bba had on its competitors 
the company employs a variety of flexible drive unit acquisition programs including outright purchase and various evaluation programs 
the purchasing cycle for the angiojet system drive unit varies depending on the customer s budget cycle 
the company has signed contracts with five purchasing groups making it an approved vendor in order to accelerate orders and increase marketing penetration 
these purchasing groups negotiate pre determined discounts on the drive units and catheters for their member hospitals 
member hospitals are required  with some exceptions  to purchase products from approved vendors  such as the company 
the purchasing groups receive a marketing fee on their purchases from the company 
these discounts and marketing fees have been offset by the increase in sales with the member hospitals of the purchasing group 
there has been no material negative effect on the company s margins or results due to these discounts and marketing fees 
the company expects us angiojet system sales to continue to grow primarily through obtaining additional food and drug administration fda approved product uses  introduction of new catheter models for existing indications  more face time selling to existing accounts  peer to peer selling  and the publication of clinical performance and cost effectiveness data 
foreign sales of the angiojet system during fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
the limited foreign sales are due to cost constraints in overseas markets 
in foreign markets  where public sector funds are more crucial for hospital operation  euro devaluations generated higher public sector deficits  which  in turn  forced reductions in hospital procedure and equipment budgets 
in japan  the coronary angiojet system clinical study was completed in april and a regulatory filing was completed in november with the japanese ministry of health and welfare mhw 
the company has responded to questions from the mhw 
the company is expecting japanese approval for coronary use of the angiojet system in fiscal the company believes that the treatment of blood clots in the coronary vessels  peripheral arteries  and vessels in the brain  are significant worldwide marketing opportunities for the angiojet system

in september the company received fda marketing approval for its perma seal dialysis access graft 
in december  the company entered into an exclusive worldwide supply and distribution agreement for its perma seal dialysis access graft 
the distributor defaulted under the agreement by failing to comply with contractually obligated levels of product purchases and with payment schedules 
in november  the distributor indicated its desire to terminate the distribution agreement and return unsold product 
the company has settled all outstanding litigation with the perma seal distributor  and has terminated the distribution relationship 
the settlement had no impact on the financial statements as the related accounts receivable balances had been appropriately written down in prior periods 
no additional sales of perma seal dialysis access grafts are expected
