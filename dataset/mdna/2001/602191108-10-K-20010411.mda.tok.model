overview the company s military rugged business segment provides specialized computers and related peripheral equipment to the united states and foreign military defense departments 
equipment in this segment takes two primary forms 
the first of these is fully militarized products  usually designed especially for a particular mission area with demanding environmental and quality requirements 
the second of these is rugged products  usually based on a commercial baseline product  but adapted by the company to meet environmental and quality specifications that exceed the requirements for commercial products 
this segment can be further differentiated between the activities of miltope corporation and those of its owned subsidiary  iv phoenix group  inc this entire segment has been impacted in recent years by reduced government spending and defense appropriations

some military programs that would have sought militarized equipment some years ago have modified the requirements to reflect a need for rugged or commercial products 
this trend has tended to benefit sales of the company s rugged product line 
even in the rugged product area  however  defense cuts have taken a toll 
competition in this area has become keen in recent years  as many government contractors pursue fewer military programs 
through its commercial segment  the company develops  manufactures and markets commercial products primarily for transportation  telecommunications and in field maintenance markets 
its products are airborne printers  in flight cabin management and entertainment products  mass storage devices  and derivatives of rugged hand held intel based computers originally developed for military applications
