allowances for credit risk and for estimated future returns are provided upon shipment

the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the american institute of certified public accountants statements of position  as amended  and  relating to software revenue recognition 
historically  the company has marketed its products primarily through its direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through the internet and an indirect channel consisting of original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers  dealers and distributors 
the company s direct sales force consists of an inside telesales group that focuses on smaller orders  or less  and an outside sales force that focuses on larger site licenses 
the company makes all of its products available for sale and distribution over the internet 
revenue through this channel has not been significant to date  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing its products through this channel 
the rogue wave strategy and business model rogue wave s strategic objective is to provide technology and services that allow customers to optimize productivity when building software solutions to address their business requirements 
simply  the company strives to create products that efficiently and effectively align underlying information technology with a customers application of that technology 
the company s history is rich in object oriented c  the language of choice for large scale  business critical applications 
as described below  during fiscal  rogue wave announced the launch of the sourcepro c product line  reflecting a substantive alteration to the company s core products and business model 
additionally  the company has made significant investment in java and xml initiatives 
most recently  rogue wave has initiated the pursuit of two new technologies  the first addressing the web integration needs of the c developer and the second involving an internet shared memory space for transparent collaborative applications  providing an area on the internet where xml documents can be written or read  subject to appropriate security constraints 
evolution of the market place has created the need for higher order solutions 
customers are less interested in atomic software components and more interested in technology suites and frameworks that address a higher percentage of their needs 
customer purchasing practices have migrated away from the individual developer  with a greater focus on project  division or enterprise requirements 
as a result  during fiscal  rogue wave began migrating from concentrating on the sale of individual developer licenses to a business model centered on the deployment of the customers finished applications 
in order to minimize the impact on long term customers  existing licensing models were maintained for historical products while introducing the new license model for new customer contracts 
the transition is expected to be completed in fiscal rogue wave r sourcepro tm c product launch effective may   rogue wave announced the launch of the sourcepro c product line  reflecting a substantive alteration to the company s core products business model 
the sourcepro c products  which integrate the majority of formerly offered rogue wave c component technology as well as adding features not previously available  are designed to provide more comprehensive solutions while optimizing the use of the company s core c products 
sourcepro c is comprised of four products sourcepro core  sourcepro db  sourcepro net and sourcepro analysis 
pricing of the sourcepro c products is based on a customer value model  which considers scope of deployment  including operating systems  in contrast to the historically employed license per developer approach 
overall  the new model allows customers greater flexibility in their utilization of the company s products 
adoption of the new core business model  including the transition to the new sourcepro c product line  and pricing strategy is not expected to have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

the company has committed and continues to commit significant management time and financial resources to developing direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
international revenue has increased during the current period as a result of the successful execution of europe s revenue growth strategy as well as one large software contract 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
the majority of the company s international revenue is generated by the company s european subsidiaries 
to date  other than revenue generated by the company s european subsidiaries  the company s international revenue has been denominated in united states dollars 
the company has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce certain risks associated with currency fluctuations 
although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has been insignificant  to the extent international revenue is denominated in local currencies  foreign currency translations may contribute to significant fluctuations in  and could have a material adverse effect upon  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

sfas requires entities to record the then fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related asset 
the liability will continue to be accreted to the fair value at the time of settlement over the useful life of the asset with the capitalized cost being depreciated over the useful life of the related asset

 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk exposure is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates and its impact on short term investments and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as of september   the company had short term investments of million of which million were held to maturity and million were held available for sale 
all investments have acquired maturities of less than days 
short term investments consist primarily of high credit and highly liquid corporate notes and commercial paper 
a reasonable reduction in overall interest rates would not have a material affect on the fair value of the investments or the financial position of the company 
exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of natural hedges  whereby funding obligations and assets are both managed in the local currency 
in addition  the company will from time to time enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage its exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates  primarily in the euro 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an appropriate range of potential rate fluctuations to the company s assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currencies 
based on the company s overall foreign currency rate exposure at september   movements in foreign currency rates would not materially affect the financial position of the company 
at september  and  the company had outstanding short term forward exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars in the amount of million and million  respectively
