the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following issues and risks  among others  should be considered in evaluating mapinfo s outlook and future 
effects of economic slowdown 
the recent stock market decline and broad economic slowdown has affected the demand for software products and related services  lengthened sales cycles and caused decreased technology spending for many of the company s customers and potential customers 
these events adversely impacted the company s revenues in  particularly in the united states  and could have a material effect on the company in the future  including without limitation  on the company s future revenues and earnings 
new products and technological change 
the mapping software and information business is characterized by extremely rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions 
these conditions require continuous expenditures on product research and development to enhance existing products and to create new products 
the company believes that the timely development of new products and continuing enhancements to existing products is essential to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace 
during recent years  the company introduced a number of new products  including mapinfo routing j server  mapinfo mapxtend  mapinfo miaware  mapinfo misites  mapinfo midirections and mapinfo coverage locator 
the company also recently began undertaking broad initiatives in wireless and crm applications 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon customer and market acceptance of these new products and initiatives 
any failure to achieve acceptance of these and other new product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of new or enhanced products or successfully manage transitions from one product release to the next 
competition 
the company encounters significant competition in the market for business mapping systems worldwide 
some of the company s competition may have significant name recognition  as well as substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs and production facilities than the company 
increased competition may lead to pricing pressures that could adversely affect the company s gross margins 
prices of software in europe and asia are generally higher than in the americas to cover localization costs and higher costs of distribution 
such price uplifts could erode in the future 
reliance on third parties 
the company relies in part on strategic partners and independent developers for the development of specialized data products that use mapinfo software 
failure by such strategic partners or independent developers to continue to develop such data products  or changes in the contractual arrangements with such strategic partners or independent developers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations 
revenues outside the americas represented approximately of total company revenues in fiscal the international portion of the company s business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including the difficulties in building and managing international operations  reliance on financial commitments from certain international distributors  difficulties in localizing products and translating documentation into foreign languages  fluctuations in import export duties and quotas  and regulatory  economic  or political changes in international markets 
the company s operating results are also affected by exchange rates 
approximately of the company s revenues were denominated in foreign currencies in changes in international business conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
prices 
future prices the company is able to obtain for its products may decrease from previous levels depending upon market or competitive pressures or distribution channel factors 
any decrease could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
intellectual property rights 
the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements  and other methods of protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products  reverse engineer or obtain and use information the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the company s shrink wrap licenses  under which the company licenses its products  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
also  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
any misappropriation of the company s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not asser t infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products 
any such assertion could require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues varies with the mix of technology development and licensing fees  product revenues  services revenues and services utilization rates  as well as with the distribution channel mix 
changes in the revenue mix  as well as the distribution model  may affect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in the future 
risks associated with distribution channels 
the company primarily markets and distributes its products in north america  europe and australia through the company s telesales  outside sales force and through third party resellers 
in the rest of the asia pacific region  the company s products are marketed and distributed through exclusive and non exclusive distribution relationships 
the company has limited control over resellers and distributors that are not employees of the company 
there can be no assurance  that the company will be able to retain its current resellers and distributors  that the resellers and distributors will perform to the company s expectations  or that the company will be able to expand its distribution channels by entering into arrangements with new resellers and distributors in the company s current markets or in new markets 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending upon factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and new versions of existing products  the ability to reduce expenses or increase revenues at a level sufficient to offset increases in expenses  the level of technology spending  and the activities of competitors 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  minor variations in the timing of orders and shipments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
the company operates with little or no backlog and has no long term contracts  and substantially all of its product revenues in each quarter result from software licenses issued in that quarter 
accordingly  the company s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and income for any period is necessarily limited 
also  the company could experien ce reduced revenues from telecommunications and internet companies as a result of decreased spending in those industries 
potential volatility of stock price 
there has been  and will likely continue to be  significant volatility in the market price of securities of technology companies 
factors such as  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results or other software companies financial results  shortfalls in the company s actual financial results compared to results previously forecasted by stock market analysts  and general conditions in the software industry and conditions in the financial markets could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
such a decline could adversely impact the ability of the company to attract and retain employees  acquire other companies or businesses and raise capital 
uncertainties in the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing consolidation of industry participants 
as a result  the company s operating results could become increasingly dependent on a smaller number of telecommunication customers 
also  recent declines in capital spending by telecommunications companies may result in a lengthening of customers decision cycles and a reduction in orders 
revenues from telecommunication customers accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal a significant reduction in orders from the telecommunication industry could have a material adverse effect on mapinfo s operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
the company has made a number of acquisitions and investments and will continue to review future acquisition opportunities 
no assurances can be given that acquisition candidates will continue to be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things  possible dilution to existing shareholders  difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions and the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies  the difficulty of operating new businesses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event that the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations  the company may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired busine ss 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition will be successfully integrated into the company s operations 
risks associated with growth 
the company increased headcount by approximately during  which resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses 
the company may further increase its headcount in the future  including in connection with acquisitions  new product offerings and geographic expansion 
if the company s revenues do not increase by an amount sufficient to offset the cost of this growth or if the increase in expenses is greater than expected  the company s net income may decline in the future 
in addition  the company s future operating performance will depend upon its ability to implement and manage its growth effectively 
the company s growth may place a strain on its administrative  operational  managerial and financial resources  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
risks associated with construction and purchase of facilities 
the company expects to incur significant expenditures in connection with the construction of its new facility in troy  new york and the potential purchase of its one global view facility 
these expenditures could materially reduce the company s liquidity and capital resources 
if the company seeks to fund these projects with debt or equity financing or a sale leaseback transaction  there can be no assurance these sources of funding will be available on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance the company will continue to grow at a rate sufficient to fully utilize the new facility and to increase revenues at a level sufficient to offset the costs of this expansion 
reliance on attracting and retaining key employees 
the company s continued success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  sales and marketing  executive  and other personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
loss of key personnel or changes in management could have an adverse impact on the company 
item a 
quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
the company exports products to diverse geographic locations 
most of the company s international revenues through subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies 
in total  the devaluation of certain foreign currencies reduced growth by approximately million or percentage points 
to date  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
the company s exposure is mitigated  in part  by the fact that it incurs certain operating costs in the same foreign currencies in which revenues are denominated 
in addition  the company has entered into a foreign currency contract to hedge against a japanese yen denominated receivable with a notional value expressed in u 
s dollars of million 
interest rate

the company does not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
to date  interest rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s operating results or financial condition
