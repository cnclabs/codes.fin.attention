historically  the company s revenues were generated primarily by i revenues in the united states from insulation services and sales of insulation products and related materials  and ii revenues in mexico from the collection of waste oils and solvents for recycling  rental of parts washing machines  brokering the disposal of waste and remediation services 
as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of the company committed to a plan to discontinue its mexican operations and to seek to identify potential buyers for its mexican business 
consequently  the company s mexican operations are classified as discontinued operations 
in october  the company completed the sale of its ownership interests in certain mexican assets previously classified as discontinued operations 
the sale specifically excluded those mexican assets involved in the nafta claim 
the terms of this sale stipulate payment of the purchase price in stages as various benchmarks are achieved in the operation of the business  as well as the buyer s assumption of all liabilities 
the company received an initial cash payment of  and recorded a receivable of  representing the company s basis in the assets sold  however  no gain or loss will be recorded on the payments until of the company s net investment is recovered 
under the terms of the sale  the company can receive up to  in payments as certain specific milestones are met 
the most significant milestone payments are associated with the buyer s ability to complete and open the aguascalientes landfill project 
if the buyer can obtain all necessary authorizations  complete construction and open the facility  payments totaling  will be due the company under the milestone payment schedule 
to date  the company believes that the buyer has not achieved any of the milestones necessary to trigger additional payments 
moreover  the company believes that the buyer is in default of its agreement with the company under the indemnity provisions and may have committed fraud in attempting to assign its interest in the companies purchased to a former employee of metalclad 
the company has engaged counsel and believes it has a cause of action against the buyer and the former company employee and the orange county  california based parent of the buyer as a result of representations said parent made relative to giving the buyer financial support in its acquisition of the companies purchased 
on november   a complaint was filed in orange county with the superior court of california

a hearing on the case was completed on march  and a decision is not anticipated until may however  regardless of the decision rendered  the company anticipates an appeal to the british columbia court of appeals

for the twelve months ended december  the company generated negative cash flow from continuing operations of  of which  in negative cash flow related to the insulation business due primarily to larger than usual accounts receivable for work performed in december given the company s client base  the energy market problems in california could adversely affect the company s ability to collect the receivable from one of its major clients  should they experience financial problems 
the remaining negative cash flow is related to corporate activities  including corporate overheads  expenses associated with public companies  interest expense and on going legal costs associated with pursuit of the company s nafta claim 
the company will require substantial additional financing to continue pursuit of its nafta claim  along with general and administrative expenses without revenues to offset such expenses 
the company is aware of its ongoing cash needs and continues to work with its investment bankers and other sources to meet its ongoing needs through december  given the company s decision to discontinue operations in mexico  and sell its businesses  the cash requirements in mexico have greatly diminished

reverse stock split on june  the shareholders of the company approved a reverse stock split of the company s common stock in a ratio of one share for up to ten shares of its outstanding common stock 
pursuant to this approval  the board of directors of the company approved a reverse split of the common shares in a ratio of one share for every ten shares 
this reverse split was effective on july  foreign currency translation effective january   mexico is no longer considered to be highly inflationary 
however  the company has discontinued its mexican operations  therefore  the impact of this change had no effect on the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation the company reflects price escalations in its quotations to its insulation customers and in its estimation of costs for materials and labor 
for construction contracts based on a cost plus or time and materials basis  the effect of inflation on the company is negligible 
for projects on a fixed price basis  the effect of inflation may result in reduced profit margin or a loss as a result of higher costs to the company as the contracts are completed  however  the majority of the company s contracts are completed within months of their commencement and the company believes that the impact of inflation on such contracts is insignificant 
although inflation has been a significant factor in the mexican economy in general since the devaluation  the company does not anticipate that it will have a material impact on its current or remaining operations
