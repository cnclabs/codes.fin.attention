item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and country 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the portfolio is also diversified by tenor to ensure that funds are readily available as needed to meet our liquidity needs 
this policy minimizes the requirement to sell securities in order to meet liquidity needs and therefore the potential effect of changing market rates on the value of securities sold 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
years ended march in thousands cash equivalents and short term investments  weighted average interest rate the primary objective of our short term investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
our short term investments are for fixed interest rates  therefore  changes in interest rates will not generate a gain or loss on these investments unless they are sold prior to maturity 
actual gains and losses due to the sale of our investments prior to maturity have been immaterial 
investments are generally not held for more than one year 
the average length of investments held at the end of fiscal was days and had an average yield of per annum 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in companies in the telecommunications industry sector  many of which are small capitalization stocks 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of march  in fiscal  we recorded a million impairment loss related to our minority investments in several telecommunications companies 
we have other investments that could become impaired in the future 
also  in fiscal we recorded a million unrealized loss on our investment in endwave corporation 
we consider this loss to be temporary in nature and accordingly this unrealized loss has been recorded in stockholders equity and the investment has been recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
however  this unrealized loss could become a realized loss in the future if the decrease in fair value is other than temporary 
in addition  at march   we had an investment of million in southern california edison bonds 
as of march   these bonds have suffered approximately a loss in fair market value due to the california energy crisis 
these bonds were scheduled to mature on june  we intend to hold these bonds pending further developments 
however  this unrealized loss could become a realized loss in the future if the decrease in fair value is other than temporary 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments except for hedging of foreign currency exposures 
we hedge certain portions of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts for purposes other than trading  however  we do not engage in any foreign currency speculation 
forward foreign exchange contracts represent agreements to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency at a specified price in the future 
these contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one month 
at march   we had forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange various foreign currencies for us dollars in the aggregate amount of million  primarily in new zealand dollars  british pounds and the euro 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on forward foreign exchange contracts are recorded currently in income as they offset corresponding gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities being hedged 
therefore  the carrying value of forward foreign exchange contracts approximates their fair value 
we believe that the credit risk with respect to our forward foreign exchange contracts is minimal because we execute contracts with major financial institutions 
market risk with respect to forward foreign exchange contracts is offset by the corresponding exposure related to the underlying assets and liabilities 
although nearly all our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced some foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and expect to incur additional gains and losses in fiscal we did engage in foreign currency hedging activities during fiscal  as explained above  and intend to continue doing so as needed 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
during fiscal and  we employed a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain balance sheet and backlog transactions in non functional currency transactions 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions when translated to the functional currency are partially offset by realized gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
the goal of this program is to minimize net fluctuations in the value of these currencies which may cause short term earnings volatility 
as of march   our foreign currency forward exchange contracts were comprised primarily of new zealand dollars  british pounds and the euro and totaled the us dollar equivalent of million
