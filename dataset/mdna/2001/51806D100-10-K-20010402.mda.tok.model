item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general the company maintained a portfolio at its peak of approximately billion of mortgage assets in june from june through march  the company delevered its portfolio by selling certain securities and repaying borrowings in an attempt to reduce the portfolio s susceptibility to basis and interest rate risk and to create additional liquidity 
in november  the company announced that its board of directors authorized management to conduct a competitive sale of its less liquid portfolio assets as part of its ongoing program to reduce the volatility of the company s assets 
as of december   the remaining carrying value of these assets amounted to million 
during the six months ended december   the company  in an effort to increase its return on stockholders equity without exposing itself to substantial credit and interest rate risk  increased its portfolio of agency certificates and mortgage derivatives to million at december  from million at december  as a result  the financing used to maintain this portfolio was increased to million at december  from million at december  as of december   based upon available for sale fair value accounting treatment of its securities  the company s net asset value per outstanding share was per share 
mariner  on behalf of the company  determines net asset value based on valuations and other information obtained through multiple independent dealer quotes 
as of december   the company s portfolio was comprised of million of agency certificates  million of ios  million of subordinate interests  million of mortgage loans  and million of other fixed income assets 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss summary general 
for the year ended december   the company had net income of million or per weighted average share  before giving effect to charges relating to the impairment of certain subordinate interests 
the impairment charge of million or per share resulted in the company reporting a net loss of million or per share 
for the year ended december   the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding was  and return on average equity was after giving effect to the impairment charges 
for the year ended december   the company had a net loss of million  or per weighted average share  the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding was  distributions were per share  or million in total and return on average equity was 
losses from investment activities 
for the year ended december   the company realized a net loss of million or per share from the sale of securities and recognized an unrealized loss of million or per share on the change in the estimated fair value of an interest rate cap agreement in effect at year end 
for the year ended december   the company realized a net loss of million or per share as a result of losses incurred in sales of securities and early terminations of long term repurchase agreements 
losses from impairment charges 
the company was notified in june of a default in a million mortgage loan in a trust fund of which the company owns subordinated interests 
the securities that are affected by this event are subordinated classes of commercial mortgage pass through certificates  series d that represent beneficial ownership interests in a trust fund created by asset securitization corporation asc  an affiliate of nomura securities international  inc nomura  at the time of the offering 
thereafter  a representative of nomura notified a representative of the company that the amount of the recovery of the securities might be negligible 
accordingly  management increased the unrealized loss on those securities at that time by approximately million representing the remaining total aggregate carrying value of those securities  pending further developments 
on october  the company filed suit in the southern district of new york against asc  nomura asset capital corp 
and nomura alleging that the defendants defrauded the company into purchasing approximately million worth of asc securities by failing to disclose among other things  that one of largest loans in the mortgage pool was seriously troubled 
on december   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action  which motion is currently pending 
the company is seeking rescission of the purchase of the securities 
during the quarter ended december   the company recognized the probable other than temporary impairment of those securities by charging the statement of operations and crediting accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet for the aggregate cumulative loss of million  such recognition had no further impact on stockholders equity from the time of the earlier increase in unrealized loss 
a recovery of this investment may be possible  but management is unable to predict the likelihood of this occurrence 
the company did not take any impairment charges for the year ended december  taxable income loss and gaap income loss for the years ended december  and  a net operating loss as calculated for tax purposes nol is estimated at approximately million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  per weighted average share 
nols generally may be carried forward for years 
the company believes that during it experienced an ownership change within the meaning of section of the code 
consequently  its use of nols generated before the ownership change to reduce taxable income after the ownership change will be subject to limitations under section generally  the use of nols in any year is limited to the value of the company s stock on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate published by the irs with respect to that date 
the company believes that the annual limitation with respect to the use of its pre ownership change nols is approximately million 
the company believes that as of december   approximately million of the estimated cumulative nol is subject to the annual limitation taxable income loss requires an annual calculation  consequently  for the year ended december   taxable income loss may be different from gaap income loss primarily as a result of differing treatment of unrealized net gains losses on securities transactions 
for the company s tax purposes  unrealized net gains losses will be recognized at the end of the year and will be aggregated with operating gains losses to produce total taxable income loss for the year 
for the years ended december  and  the company had unrealized net gains of approximately million and million  respectively 
the distinction between taxable income loss and gaap income loss is important to the company s stockholders because dividends or distributions are declared on the basis of taxable income 
while the company does not pay taxes so long as it satisfies the requirements for exemption from taxation pursuant to the reit provisions of the code  each year the company completes a corporate tax form wherein taxable income is calculated as if the company were to be taxed 
this taxable income level helps to determine the amount of dividends the company intends to pay out over time 
interest income and average interest earning asset yields the company had average interest earning assets of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the company earns interest income primarily from its portfolio of investments and cash equivalents

interest expense and the average cost of funds the company incurs interest expense primarily from borrowed funds under short term repurchase agreements that finance most of its portfolio of investments 
interest expense is calculated in the same manner for tax and gaap purposes 
the company generally has structured its borrowings to closely correlate the company s cost of borrowed funds with changes in one month libor  although the company may choose to extend the maturity of its liabilities at any time  subject to the lender s consent 
for the year ended december   the company had average borrowed funds under short term repurchase agreements of million and interest expense of million with an average cost of funds of compared to average borrowed funds under short term repurchase agreements of million and interest expense of million with an average cost of funds of for the year ended december  the company s average cost of funds was above one month libor for the year ended december  compared to above one month libor for the year ended december  during the year ended december   average one month libor  which was  was lower than average six month libor  which was

the higher cost of funds level that was attained as a result of the effect of these actions remained virtually unchanged for the remainder of the year and was the significant factor contributing to the cost of funds increase in over interest rate agreements the company follows an interest rate risk management strategy designed to protect against the adverse effects of major interest rate changes through the use of derivative interest rate agreements 
interest rate agreements that have been used by the company consist of a purchased interest rate cap cap and interest rate swaps swaps 
in may  the company purchased a cap with a notional amount of million for a premium of million to reduce the risk of rising interest rates on the cost of the short term repurchase agreements used to finance its investments 
the cap agreement has a term of three years and provides for monthly payments of interest to the company to the extent that the one month libor exceeds as applied to the notional amount 
at december   the cap had an estimated fair value of million and the company recorded an unrealized loss of million in the statement of operations 
as a result of the reduction in interest rates  the company closed out the cap in january for million and recognized an additional loss of million in the statement of operations 
the company did not enter into any interest rate swaps or other caps in and net interest income net interest income  which equals total interest income less total interest expense  amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net interest rate spread  which equals the yield on the company s interest earning assets excluding cash and cash equivalents less the average cost of funds for the period was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the table below shows the components of net interest income  yield on average interest earning assets and average cost of funds for the years ended december  and components of net interest income dollars in thousands yield on average interset interest average averag e amortized income average income on amortized balanc e of average cost of on cash cash total cost of repurc hase total cost net invest invest equiva equiva interest invest agree interest of interest ments ments lents lents income ments ments expense funds income for the years ended december  december  the overall decrease in net interest income was due primarily to the company s substantially reduced investment portfolio and higher average cost of funds  partially offset by the reduced level of financing 
for the year ended december   the sharp increase in short term borrowing rates coupled with an emphasis on lower risk agency certificates lowered the net interest rate spread from the prior year 
credit considerations during  the company recognized the probable other than temporary impairment in the value of certain subordinate interests as a result of a default in one of the underlying mortgage loans 
see net income loss summary losses from impairment charges 
the impairment in value recognized by the company represents the maximum amount  however  the ultimate amount of the impairment loss may be lower but is indeterminable at this time 
the company has experienced no other credit losses on its investment portfolio to date  but other losses may be experienced in the future 
at december  and december   the company had limited its exposure to credit losses on its portfolio excluding the impaired securities by holding and  respectively  of its investments in mortgage securities issued by fnma  gnma and fhlmc including ios  fixed floating rate mortgage securities and fixed rate pass through mortgage securities

for the year ended december   the company realized a net loss of million or per weighted average share  as a result of losses incurred in sales of securities and terminations of interest rate swaps and a reduction in income from its mortgage securities due to a reduced investment portfolio and increasing prepayments 
in response to a difficult credit environment  the company raised cash by selling portfolio securities to meet increased margin requirements 
losses from impairment charges 
for the year ended december   the company treated its portfolio of adjustable rate ios as impaired assets and took an impairment charge against operations of million or per weighted average share 
at the end of the second and third quarters of  in light of the continued flat yield curve  low levels of libor and faster than expected prepayment rates over an extended period of time  the company decided that the impairment in market value was a permanent impairment 
accordingly  in the second and third quarters of  the company decided that an impairment charge of million and million  respectively  should be realized in current income 
during the year ended december   no additional impairment charges were taken 
most of the company s ios were libor based floating rate ios purchased in december they were acquired to balance duration in the company s portfolio 
this investment was made based on the company s evaluation of the then current prepayments  the shape of the yield curve and the relative values of similar investments 
in evaluating the impairment charge on the ios  the company employed current estimates of future prepayments obtained from independent sources 
for ios collateralized by fixed rate pass through mortgage securities issued by fnma  gnma and fhlmc collectively  agency fixed rate pass throughs  the company utilized the median lifetime projection prepayment speeds compiled and reported by bloomberg lp from a survey of leading dealers in the mortgage market 
for private label ios collateralized by non government agency mortgage securities  the company employed prepayment estimates from at least one independent dealer 
the prepayment estimates typically take into consideration the current level and shape of the yield curve 
as a result of the substantial decline in interest rates since the purchase of the ios  current estimates of prepayment speeds significantly exceed the original prepayment speed estimates 
at the end of the first quarter of  the majority of the company s ios were floating rate ios 
floating rate ios are unique securities in that the interest payments on these securities increase as one month libor increases 
due to this characteristic of option value  floating rate ios trade at much lower yields than fixed rate ios 
at the end of the second and third quarter of  in light of the continued flat yield curve  low levels of libor and faster than expected prepayment rates actually occurring for an extended period of time  the company decided that the impairment in market value was other than temporary

nols generally may be carried forward for years 
the company believes that during it experienced an ownership change within the meaning of section of the code 
consequently  its use of such nols generated before the ownership change to reduce taxable income after the ownership change will be subject to limitations under section generally  the use of nols in any year is limited to the value of the company s stock on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate published by the irs with respect to that date

a relatively flat yield curve caused financing costs to be relatively high compared to the income earned on the company s mortgage assets 
the dislocation in the fixed income securities market and the increased risk of prepayments  which affected the value of the company s portfolio  together with the tightening of credit available for investment in securities  adversely affected the company s ability to employ leverage profitably 
interest rate agreements in december  the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of  million 
the company used these interest rate swaps to hedge its available for sale portfolio of fixed rate agency certificates 
the primary objective of this hedging strategy was to change the interest rate characteristics of these securities from fixed to variable rates  to better correspond to the maturity and repricing characteristics of the short term repurchase agreements used by the company to fund these investments 
this primary objective was the basis for the company s hedge accounting treatment 
the company continually monitored the swaps to ensure that they were effective at changing the interest rate characteristics of the securities 
a secondary objective was to offset fluctuations in the fair value of the securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates 
in september  the company experienced margin calls and believed it prudent to increase its liquidity  and therefore  liquidated a large portion of its agency certificates 
in conjunction with liquidating these securities positions  the company also discontinued hedge accounting for the related swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the company recognized the unrealized loss on these swaps as an element of the overall loss on the liquidation of the securities of million 
in october  the company liquidated agency certificates in response to continued margin calls and the need for liquidity 
the overall october loss on the liquidation of agency certificates  including losses recognized upon suspension of hedge accounting for the remaining swap with a notional amount of million  totaled million 
on the day of each suspension of hedge accounting  the affected swaps were closed out without additional gain or loss 
the company did not enter into any interest rate swaps during the year ended december   after having used them extensively in and the valuations and other information used by the company to monitor the effectiveness of its interest rate swap hedging strategy were obtained through multiple independent dealer quotes 
this same information was used to record the investments and swaps in the company s financial statements and to determine the company s net asset value 
the company has never purchased or written options to enter into swaps

the net interest rate spread increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to the mix of mortgage assets in the company s portfolio  which contained a greater percentage of less liquid securities that finance at higher spreads

these borrowings appear on the balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
substantially all of the company s investments are currently accepted as collateral for such borrowings 
the company has not established  and currently does not intend to establish  permanent lines of credit 
the company has obtained  and believes it will be able to continue to obtain  short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with the company s financing objectives 
at december  and  the company had borrowings outstanding from three and two lenders  respectively 
such borrowings are generally short term day term and may be renewed by the lender at its discretion 
during the year ended december   the term to maturity of the company s borrowings has ranged from one day to days  with a weighted average remaining maturity of days at december  while during  the term to maturity ranged from one day to five years with a weighted average remaining maturity of days at december  at december   the company had outstanding million of repurchase agreements compared to million outstanding at december  all of the company s borrowings have a cost of funds which adjusts periodically based on a fixed spread over or under one month libor 
at december  and  the weighted average cost of funds for all of the company s borrowings was and  respectively 
at december   investments actually pledged had an estimated fair value of million compared to million at december  during the first quarter of  to improve its liquidity  the company terminated a repurchase agreement with a broker dealer with respect to million of the company s agency certificates and recognized a loss of approximately million in the statement of operations 
liquidity liquidity  which is the company s ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows the company to purchase additional securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for the company include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity varies over time as the market value of the company s securities varies 
the company s balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should the company s needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  management believes that the company s securities could in most circumstances be sold to raise cash  however  if the company is forced to liquidate mortgage assets that qualify as qualified real estate assets to repay borrowings  there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its reit status 
the availability of financing for the company s portfolio was stable during and this is in sharp contrast to the third and fourth quarters of which  due to events in the financial markets  saw a significant decline in the availability of financing 
the company responded by delevering its portfolio and selling approximately billion of mortgage assets  including approximately billion of agency certificates during that time 
in november  the board of directors increased the amount of common stock authorized to be repurchased under the company s stock repurchase program to million 
pursuant to the repurchase program  for the year ended december   the company used the proceeds of sales of  and payments from its portfolio securities to repurchase in open market transactions  shares of common stock for approximately million 
such purchases were made at a weighted average price per share of excluding commission costs 
for the year ended december   the company used the proceeds of sales of  and payments from  its portfolio securities to repurchase  shares of common stock for approximately million at a weighted average price per share of excluding commission costs 
stockholders equity the company uses available for sale accounting treatment for its securities  these assets are carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon such available for sale accounting treatment  the company s stockholders equity base at december  was million  or per outstanding share  compared to million  or per outstanding share  at december  if the company had used historical amortized cost accounting  the company s stockholders equity base at december  would have been million  or per outstanding share compared to million  or per outstanding share  at december  with the company s available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in estimated fair values of assets do not impact gaap net income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the assets and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
by accounting for its assets in this manner  the company hopes to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  the book value and book value per share of the company are likely to fluctuate far more than if the company used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparison with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may be misleading 
unrealized changes in the estimated net fair value of securities have one direct effect on the company s potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase the company s stockholders equity base and allow the company to increase its borrowing capacity while negative changes in the net market value of the company s securities might impair the company s liquidity position  requiring the company to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale

capital and leverage strategies the company s operations were leveraged approximately to at december  compared to approximately to at december  during the six months ended december   the company  in an effort to increase its return on stockholders equity without exposing itself to substantial credit and interest rate risk  increased its portfolio of agency certificates and mortgage derivatives 
as a result  the financing used to maintain this portfolio was also increased 
consequently  the company s equity to assets ratio decreased to approximately at december  from approximately at december  during the year ended december   that ratio ranged from a high of approximately to a low of approximately compared to a range of a high of approximately to a low of approximately during currently the company finances most securities acquisitions primarily by borrowing against or leveraging its existing portfolio 
the company s target for its equity to assets ratio depends on market conditions and other relevant factors 
the equity to assets ratio is total stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets 
the company s total stockholders equity  for purposes of this calculation  equals the company s stockholders equity determined in accordance with gaap with the value of the company s investment portfolio on a marked to market basis 
for purchased mortgage assets  the company obtains market quotes for its mortgage assets from independent broker dealers that make markets in securities similar to those in the company s portfolio 
the board of directors has discretion to deviate from or change the company s indebtedness policy at any time 
however  the company endeavors to maintain an adequate capital base to protect against interest rate environments in which the company s financing and hedging costs might exceed interest income from its mortgage assets 
these conditions could occur  for example  when  due to interest rate fluctuations  interest income on the company s mortgage assets which occur during periods  such as the first three quarters of  of rapidly rising interest rates or during periods when the mortgage loans in the portfolio are prepaying rapidly lags behind interest rate increases in the company s variable rate borrowings 
inflation virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates are expected to influence the company s performance more directly than inflation 
while changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates  interest rates ordinarily increase during periods of high or increasing inflation and decrease during periods of low or declining inflation 
accordingly  management believes that the company s financial condition or results of operations will be influenced by inflation to the extent interest rates are affected by inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the company s net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  the value of the company s mortgage securities and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  indeed  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
as described previously  the company has experienced significant losses as a result of its hedging activities 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net portfolio value as of december  should interest rates go up or down shocked basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
net portfolio value is defined as interest earning assets net of interest bearing liabilities 
all changes in value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
december  projected percentage change in change in interest rate net portfolio value basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
the company s objective is to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of declining interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except i floating rate securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and ii fixed rate mortgage assets reflect estimated prepayments  which were estimated based on analyses of broker estimates 
management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which the assumptions are based
