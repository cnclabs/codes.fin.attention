item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this report beginning on page f the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to the differences are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of high performance  highly reliable fiber optic subsystems and modules for fiber optic transmission systems used to address the bandwidth limitations in metropolitan area networks and high speed premises networks 
our subsystems and modules include optical transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders that convert electronic signals into optical signals and back to electronic signals  enabling high speed communication of voice and data traffic over public and private networks 
we began our operations and shipped our first products in november of and have been profitable every year since our inception 
furukawa beneficially owns all of our outstanding class b common stock  representing of our outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
since our inception  we have purchased substantially all of our lasers and the majority of our other fiber optic components from furukawa 
we have relied on furukawa s research and development capabilities to provide us with technologically advanced lasers and fiber optic components which we purchase from furukawa for inclusion in our products 
we currently purchase the majority of lasers from furukawa using short term purchase orders 
we operate in one industry segment  the design and manufacture of fiber optic subsystems and modules 
we sell our products to fiber optic communication equipment manufacturers  directly and through contract manufacturers who incorporate them into systems they assemble for equipment manufacturers 
we define our customers as equipment manufacturers who have purchased our products directly or ordered our products for incorporation into systems produced by contract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue upon product shipment  and sales returns and allowances have been insignificant 
for the fiscal year ended september   our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue  with alcatel and cisco systems accounting for approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  although our revenue from sales to our other customers continues to increase  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
our sales are made on a purchase order basis rather than by long term purchase commitments 
our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders without penalty on short notice 
in october  methode electronics  inc filed a lawsuit against infineon technologies corporation and us seeking unspecified damages  including monetary damages  injunctive relief  attorneys fees and costs arising from our alleged infringement of some of the claims contained in patents assigned to methode  including patents relating to our x pin configuration products 
after methode initiated the lawsuit  it assigned to stratos lightwave  inc  a methode spin off  all of methode s rights  title and interest in the patent at issue 
the court has added stratos as a plaintiff to the lawsuit 
the parties have exchanged extensive initial disclosures and supplemental disclosures of information mandated by the court s local rules 
unless the case terminates through dispositive motions or through settlement  trial is scheduled to commence in september although our expenses and other resources expended on this lawsuit have been greater in fiscal year ended september  than in prior years  the lawsuit has not had a material effect on our business operations 
as the lawsuit progresses  we expect to incur greater legal fees and expenses 
in addition  we expect that the defense of this lawsuit will divert the efforts and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
for the fiscal year ended september   sales of our x products alleged to infringe the methode stratos patents accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
sales of our other products alleged to infringe the methode patents represented an immaterial amount of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  see legal proceedings 
during the fiscal year ended september   the telecommunications sector  and in particular the fiber optic networking sector  suffered a severe downturn 
system providers are scaling back on deployment and have dramatically slowed their purchases of systems from equipment manufacturers 
as a result  equipment manufacturers have also slowed purchases of components and modules from our competitors and from us 
moreover  as equipment manufacturers sales declined  they have relied on their excess component inventories to meet reduced demand and have moved to reduce their overall component and module inventory levels 
consequently  the slowdown continues to have a negative impact on our business as we face declining sales as the result of our customers declining business and the resulting adjustment to their inventory levels 
the average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature from factors such as increased competition  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes 
we anticipate that average selling prices of our existing products will continue to decline in future periods although the timing and degree of the declines cannot be predicted with any certainty 
we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices on a timely basis 
our cost of revenue consists principally of materials  as well as salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we purchase several key components for our products from a limited number of suppliers 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel  cost of developing prototypes  fees paid to consultants and depreciation of test and prototyping equipment 
our research and development expenses also consist of materials and overhead costs related to major product development projects 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our future success 
accordingly  we intend to expand our internal research and development capabilities in the future to develop new products 
as a result  we expect that our research and development expenses in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue will increase significantly in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives  product marketing and promotion costs 
we intend to substantially expand our sales and marketing operations and efforts  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase sales and market awareness of our products 
in december we opened a sales office in franklin  massachusetts  in july we opened sales offices in bury st 
edmunds  england and richardson  texas and in may we opened a sales office in ottawa  canada 
we also intend to open an additional sales office in san jose  california 
we believe that investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect that  in support of our operations as a public company  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase particularly due to the recent rise in our directors and officers insurance premiums as a result of the current downturn in the equity markets 
general and administrative expenses are also likely to be affected in future periods by significant legal fees  stock compensation and expenses incurred in connection with pending litigation 
results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue fiscal years ended september  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal years ended september  and revenue revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was due substantially to an increase in demand from our existing customers and  to a lesser extent  to demand from new customers and from revenue generated by newer products with higher average selling prices  such as our ptc transponder products 
sales of our products for metropolitan area networks increased to of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  from of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  we do not expect that our rate of year to year growth in revenue will be sustainable in future periods  as the average selling prices for existing products may decline in response to product introductions by competitors or us  or other factors  including pressure from significant customers for price concessions and reductions in spending for fiber optic equipment as a result of the economic slowdown 
we believe that the increase in customer demand for our products in recent years reflects increased demand for components due to growth in the deployment of fiber optic networks worldwide 
during the fiscal year ended september   the telecommunications sector  and in particular the fiber optic networking sector  suffered a severe downturn

gross margin decreased to from during this period 
the decrease in gross margin was due to a reduction in average selling prices and to the write down of excess inventory 
we expect continued pricing pressure to have an unfavorable impact on gross margins in future periods as the average selling prices for existing products are expected to decline in response to product introductions by competitors and pressure from significant customers for price concessions 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to increased supplies and equipment resulting from an increase in engineers hired during this period 
research and development as a percentage of revenue decreased to from over this period because of a significant growth in revenue 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue as we expand our research and development efforts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was due to increased commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives as a result of an increase in the sales of our high performance subsystems and modules and an increase in advertising

we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase as a percentage of revenue as we expand our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was the result of an increase in legal and other professional fees and an increase in insurance expense resulting from being a public company 
general and administrative expenses are likely to be affected in future periods by significant legal fees  stock compensation and expenses incurred with pending litigation

cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  gross margin increased to from during this period 
the increase in gross margin was due to a decrease in labor costs as a percentage of revenue due to higher productivity in our new facility  lower component costs as a percentage of revenue due to higher volume purchases and a decrease in overhead as a percentage of revenue 
provisions for obsolete inventory increased during this period as we increased inventory to maintain a supply of components 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to increased recruiting and hiring of engineering personnel  including expenses related to employee benefits and bonuses 
we also incurred development costs of  paid to furukawa for the automation of our product testing procedure 
research and development as a percentage of revenue decreased to from over this period because of a significant growth in revenue 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly as a percentage of revenue as we expand our research and development efforts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was due to increased employee benefits and bonuses  including commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives as a result of an increase in the sales of our high performance subsystems and modules and the addition of a sales office in franklin  massachusetts

net income loss the quarterly operating results reflect revenue growth through the quarters ended december and march  and decreases in revenue for the quarters ended june and september  as compared with their immediate prior quarter 
revenue increased and in the quarters ended december and march   respectively  compared to the previous quarter due to increased sales to new and existing customers 
new and existing customer purchases were primarily the result of the growth in the deployment of fiber optic networks worldwide 
revenue decreased and in the quarters ended june and september   respectively  compared to the previous quarter  due to a general economic downturn  which has caused system providers to scale back on deployment fiber optic networks 
this downturn has resulted in the reduction by our customers and equipment manufacturers of their purchases of components and modules that we provide 
the quarterly operating results reflect an increase in the cost of revenue for the first two quarters and a decrease for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year end  as compared with their immediate prior quarter 
cost of revenue ranged from between and of revenue for the four quarters of fiscal year end and the first two quarters of fiscal year end cost of revenue as a percent of revenue in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year end was and  respectively 
the increase in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year end as a percent of revenue over the prior six quarters was the result of charges related to the write down of excess inventory of million and million  respectively 
excluding the charges related to the inventory write downs  we expect cost of revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue as the average selling prices for existing products are expected to decline in response to product introductions by competitors and pressure from significant customers for price concessions 
research and development expenses reflected in our quarterly operating results range between and of revenue for the four quarters of fiscal year end and the first three quarters of fiscal year end research and development expenses in the fourth quarter ended september  was of revenue 
the increase in research and development expense as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year end was the result of a decrease in revenue compared to the prior quarter 
although we anticipate that the current economic environment will continue to have a negative impact on our business  we intend to expand our research and development capabilities to develop new products and strengthen our position to take advantage of the opportunities when the market recovers 
as a result  we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing expenses ranged between and of revenue for the four quarters of fiscal year end and the first three quarters of fiscal year end sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year end was of revenue 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year end was the result of the decrease in commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives 
because of our plans to expand our sales and marketing operations  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods 
general and administrative expenses ranged between and of revenue for the four quarters of fiscal year end and the first three quarters of fiscal year end general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year end was of revenue 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year end was the result of a decrease in revenue compared to the prior quarter 
we expect the dollar level of these costs to increase as a result of increased legal fees  accounting costs and other costs associated with being a public company 
our historical operating results have varied significantly  and our future quarterly operating results are likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors which could cause our operating results to vary include fluctuations in the demand for and sales of our products  the timing of customer orders  the cancellation of existing orders  competitive factors such as introductions of new products  our ability to develop  introduce and manufacture new products in a timely manner  our ability to control expenses  the availability of components for our products  the mix of our products sold  changes in industry standards and general economic conditions in the communications and related industries 
the following table sets forth revenue attributable to each of our product groups as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
fiscal years ended september  receivers transceivers transmitters other revenue we believe the increase in the percentage of sales attributable to our transceiver products during the periods reflected in the table above reflects an overall increase in customer demand for products designed with higher levels of integration  such as transceivers 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   our primary source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents balance of million and million of marketable securities which consist primarily of united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
our unused revolving line of credit totaling approximately million provided an additional source of liquidity 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations 
additional financing has been generated through lines of credit and term loans 
as of september   our working capital was million with a current ratio of as of september   our working capital was million with a current ratio of because of our low debt balances  we believe that additional cash could be borrowed if necessary  however  cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and existing loan facilities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the next months 
as of september   we had a million balance outstanding under our term loan and no balance outstanding under our million revolving line of credit 
the term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest on amounts outstanding at various time intervals and the market rates based on our election at a per annum rate equal to either a the prime rate or b libor plus 
the term loan matures july  and the proceeds of the term loan were used to purchase our primary corporate and manufacturing facility in chatsworth  california 
the revolving credit facility can be used to fund working capital requirements 
the term loan and our revolving credit facility contain customary covenants  including covenants limiting indebtedness and the disposition of assets 
to secure our payment and performance obligations under the term loan we have pledged all of our assets as collateral 
the term loan and the revolving credit facility also require that we comply with financial covenants  which require us to maintain our tangible net worth  cash position and revenue at specified levels 
our need to comply with these covenants does not materially affect the operation of our business 
we have committed to make capital expenditures totaling  primarily to purchase additional production equipment to continue our manufacturing capacity expansion 
during the fiscal year ended september   we generated cash flow from operations of million 
the increase in cash generated by operating activities during this period was caused by increases in income and a decrease in accounts receivables  partially offset by increases in income tax benefits and other current assets and decreases accounts payable and accounts payable to related parties 
for the years ended september  and  we generated net cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash generated by operations between the years ended september  and was caused by increased income  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
during the fiscal year ended september  and september   cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
the majority of cash used in investing activities was for the net purchase of marketable securities  the june  purchase of a  square foot building in woodland hills  california for million and capital expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment to expand and automate our manufacturing facility 
on november   we completed an initial public offering of our class a common stock 
all  shares of class a common stock registered under the registration statement were sold at a price of per share  which amount includes exercise of the underwriters over allotment option of  shares 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses we received net proceeds from the initial public offering of approximately million 
inflation inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to interest rate risk on our existing term loan and revolving credit facility and on our investment portfolio 
our variable rate debt consists of term loan borrowing of million 
to date we have not utilized our floating rate debt under the revolving credit facility 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and cash equivalents includes million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts 
in addition  we have million invested in marketable securities  which represents investments in united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
as of september   our investment in marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent united states treasury notes and treasury bonds with a maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
maturities on held to maturity marketable debt securities range from three months to two years 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the result would be an annual increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on our term loan and an annual increase or decrease of interest income of million on our investment portfolio 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
sales to foreign customers are denominated in us dollars and as such we have no foreign currency fluctuation risk
