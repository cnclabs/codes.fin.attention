revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  product sales increased to million compared to million 
an approximately million increase in cardioseal r septal occluder product sales was partially offset by an approximately million decrease in product sales from the neurosciences business unit 
license fees and royalties for the year ended december  decreased to  from million for the year ended december  these revenues relate primarily to the exclusive distribution of the company s stent technology by boston scientific corporation and included  and million of royalties and  and  of cost sharing payments for the years ended december  and  respectively

cost of product sales decreased by  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of product sales  as a percent of product sales  decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of product sales as a percent of product sales in is primarily attributable to a shifting sales mix in favor of the company s cardioseal r septal occluders which have a lower product cost as a percent of sales than the company s other product lines 
research and development 
research and development expense increased by  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to contract management  clinical monitoring  data management and biostatisical analysis in support of the fda approval process for various medical use applications of the cardioseal r and starflex tm products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to a significant increase in legal fees associated with ongoing litigation and general corporate matters 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the development of a direct sales force for the cardioseal r products in the united states and europe 
impairment of long lived assets 
the neurosciences business unit has continued to incur operating losses for the year ended december   which has caused management and the board of directors of the company to periodically consider various strategic alternatives for that unit 
in the second quarter  based upon these considerations  an undiscounted cash flow analysis and other considerations  the company recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets of the neurosciences business unit to their estimated fair value 
the long lived assets consist primarily of a building and other fixed assets located in the company s biot  france facility 
the current year impairment charge follows a million impairment charge for the year ended december  for goodwill recorded upon the acquisition of neurosciences business unit in july settlement of litigation 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a charge of  associated with the settlement  after year end  of litigation between sodem diffusion sa sodem and nmt neurosciences implants france sa nmt france  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

during the year ended december   the company sold its investment in image technologies corporation for  cash proceeds plus assumption of the company s position as guarantor of certain itc liabilities see notes and c of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to the repayment of million of the company s subordinated note in september and the repayments of million and  of the senior secured debt and the subordinated note  respectively  on april  in connection with the sale of the u 
k operations of the company s neurosciences business unit see note a and b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased by to  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the use of million of cash to repay a portion of the subordinated note in september gain loss on sale of discontinued operations 
net gain from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss in represented a million loss on the sale of the uk operations of the company s neurosciences business unit  partially offset by  of income from the discontinued operations 
the gain from discontinued operations in represents a revision of estimates made concerning the costs associated with the sale of the uk operations see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to the effect of including a full year s revenues related to the company s neurosciences business unit during when compared to as the company acquired this division on july  additionally the company had increased unit sales of vena cava filters and cardioseal septal occluders in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  finally  in september  the company received approvals from the fda for use of the cadioseal septal occluder under certain hde regulations which contributed to the increased unit sales of that product during the year ended december  license fees and royalties for the year ended december  amounted to million and consist of royalty payments of million and cost sharing payments received from boston scientific of approximately  and patent license payments of approximately  the company recorded million in license fees and royalties from boston scientific related to its stent technology in the year ended december   consisting of  of milestone payments  million of royalty payments  and  of cost sharing payments received from boston scientific 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to the effect of including a full year s cost of sales related to the company s neurosciences business unit during when compared to the partial year in also contributing to this increase were costs attributable to the company s increased unit sales of vena cava filters and cardioseal r septal occluders in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  cost of product sales  as a percent of product sales  remained relatively consistent at for the year ended december  as compared with for the year ended december  research and development 
research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to the effect of including a full year of research and development expenses related to the company s neurosciences business unit during when compared to the partial year in also contributing to this increase in research and development expense were increased regulatory and clinical trial expenses relating to clinical trials of the cardioseal septal occluder  as well as for more recent clinical trials related to fenestrated fontan procedures fef  and ventricular septal defects vsds for which the company received fda approval under hde regulations in september in addition  the company has had increased activity in the company s development programs for vena cava filters  including ce mark approval for its removable vena cava filter in september  and for other products under development 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to the effect of including a full year of general and administrative expenses related to the company s neurosciences business unit during when compared to the partial year in in addition  the company had increased professional fees and travel expenses related to supporting the operations of the company s neurosciences business unit for the full year ended december  as compared to the partial year for the year ended december  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily attributable to the effect of including a full year of selling and marketing expenses related to the company s neurosciences business unit during when compared to the partial year in during  marketing activities related to the cardioseal septal occluder relating to clinical trials and the commencement of commercial sales of the cardioseal septal occluder that began in june in european and other international markets increased 
during  the marketing efforts related to these clinical trials decreased as the trials were coming to completion 
however  marketing efforts were increased for new clinical trials relating to fenestrated fontan procedures fef  and ventricular septal defects vsds for which the company received fda approval under hde regulations in september write down of notes receivable from image technologies corporation 
during the year ended december   the company performed a detailed review of the itc operations 
based upon this analysis and discussion with itc s management and other investors  the company determined that there was a significant risk that the company s notes receivable from itc would not be repaid 
the analysis and discussions indicated that at september   itc had insufficient cash resources to fund its operations  itc s product revenue had declined during the year ended december  and was significantly below planned levels and itc was seeking additional capital from numerous sources and that any future financings would likely be dilutive to the company s equity position and could contain a security interest senior to the company 
accordingly  the company charged the carrying value of the notes receivable of approximately million to operations during the year ended december  impairment of long lived asset 
in connection with the sale of the uk operations and certain other assets of its neurosciences business unit on april  see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company recorded at december  a million impairment charge for goodwill recorded upon the acquisition of the neurosciences business unit in july this impairment charge was determined based upon the company s analysis of estimated cash flows of its neurosciences business unit and the carrying value of all of the long lived assets of neurosciences business unit which were not sold in april the company s assessment of the value of the assets of neurosciences business unit was corroborated by independent outside parties 
equity in net loss of image technologies corporation 
during the year ended december  and  the company recorded  and  respectively  as its equity in the loss of itc 
the carrying value of the note receivable from itc has been reduced by these amounts and charged to operations during the year ended december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the company s acquisition of eni on july  for which the company borrowed million of subordinated debt  which accrues interest at per annum 
in addition  the amortization of original issue discount related to the subordinated note of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  is included in interest expense in the statements of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  the company repaid approximately million of outstanding debt obligations from proceeds received from the sale of the uk operations and certain other assets of the neurosciences business unit 
the company did not allocate interest expense associated with the senior secured debt and subordinated notes to discontinued operations 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the company s lower cash balances as a result of its financing the acquisition of eni on july  with cash of million  plus approximately million of acquisition costs 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the million reduction in september of its million subordinated note payable to an affiliate of a significant stockholder of the company see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company recorded a million extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the statement of operations which primarily relates to the accelerated pro rata write off of the original issue discount and deferred financing costs of the subordinated note payable 
provision for income taxes 
the company had a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  which represents the taxes on income generated in france by the company s neuroscience 
business unit the company generated a net operating loss for federal and state income tax purposes in the united states in the year ended december  the company had a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  based on an operating income before the write off of in process research and development expenses of  the equity in loss of itc of  and other nondeductible items and an estimated effective tax rate of approximately loss on sale of discontinued operations 
on april   the company sold the uk operations and certain other assets of the neurosciences business unit  which consisted primarily of the selector r ultrasonic aspirator  ruggles tm surgical instruments and cryosurgery product lines  including certain assets and liabilities for million in cash 
the company recorded a million loss on this sale  comprised of proceeds of million less estimated transaction costs of million  and net assets sold of million 
the transaction costs consisted principally of legal and accounting fees  severance arrangements with certain employees and other estimated costs associated with discontinuing the operation and consummating the sale 
included in the loss on sale are the estimated operating results of the discontinued operations for the period from january  to april  the company has not allocated interest expense to discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  as compared to million as of december  during year ended december   the company s operations provided cash of approximately million which consisted of approximately million of cash used by operations prior to approximately million of noncash charges and million net decrease in working capital items 
in july  the company financed a portion of the acquisition of eni with million of the company s cash and a million subordinated note issued to an affiliate of a significant stockholder of the company 
the subordinated note is due september  with quarterly interest payable at per annum 
on september   the company entered into a million senior secured debt facility with a bank  million of the proceeds of which was used to reduce the principal amount of the million subordinated note 
the company also used million of its own cash to further reduce the principal amount of the million subordinated note 
the remaining million of the senior secured debt facility was available to be drawn down by the company for working capital purposes  as needed 
the facility had a term of three years with interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate on us borrowings and an equivalent market rate on foreign currency borrowings 
in april  the company used the proceeds from the sale of the uk operations and certain other assets of the neurosciences business unit see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements to reduce the subordinated note payable by  and to repay the entire senior secured debt balance of million 
in september  the working capital portion of the senior secured debt facility was terminated by the bank 
at december   the outstanding balance of the subordinated note  net of original issue discount of approximately  was approximately million 
at december   the company was in compliance with newly amended subordinated debt covenants relating to maintenance of tangible net equity 
in addition  the subordinated debt covenants relating to maintenance of certain ratios  tangible net equity and income were amended for the million current portion of the subordinated debt balance consists of a  due january from the proceeds obtained in connection with the sale of the company s investment in itc see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and b  due april in connection with the amended debt covenants agreement 
purchases of property and equipment for use in the company s manufacturing  research and development and general and administrative activities  exclusive of the assumption of equipment under lease and capital lease obligations of approximately  from itc  amounted to  for the year ended december  in september  the company entered into a new equipment financing agreement for up to a maximum of  of purchases based upon a year term 
as of december  approximately  of purchases were in the process of being financed under this arrangement  leaving approximately  available to finance future equipment purchases 
the company is party to various contractual arrangements including royalty arrangements and employment and consulting agreements with current employees and consultants 
minimum guaranteed royalty payments for are approximately the company also has committed to purchase certain minimum quantities of the vena cava filter component from a supplier through june  which agreement is expected to be extended through december see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
all of these arrangements require cash payments by the company over varying periods of time 
certain of these arrangements are cancelable on short notice and certain require termination or severance payments as part of any early termination 
the company may require additional funds for its research and product development programs  preclinical and clinical testing  operating expenses  regulatory processes  manufacturing and marketing programs and potential licenses and acquisitions 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the sales of its products  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in the company s existing research  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any collaborative  licensing and other similar arrangements that the company may establish 
the company believes that existing cash and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital  financing and capital expenditure requirements through at least euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their national currency unit and irrevocably established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
during the three year transition period between january  and january   the euro will be a cashless currency  existing only as a unit of account 
payments made to accounts in these member states may be made either in the denominated legacy currency unit of the account or in euros 
beginning on january   euro banknotes and coins will be introduced  and legacy currency banknotes and coins will be withdrawn from circulation 
no later than july   the euro will be the sole national currency unit in these member states  and the legacy currency banknotes and coins will no longer be accepted as legal tender 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its business within the member countries of the european union  and accordingly its existing systems are generally capable of accommodating multiple currencies  including the euro 
the company is assessing the potential impact from the euro conversion in a number of areas  including the following the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis  the impact on currency exchange costs and currency exchange rate risk  and the impact on existing contracts 
as of december   the impact of the euro conversion has not had a material impact on the operations of the company 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we have historically failed to meet covenants in our loan agreements and may face difficulties in meeting them in the future 
we financed a significant portion of the acquisition of our neurosurgical instruments business with million of subordinated debt borrowed from an affiliate of whitney co  one of our significant stockholders 
as of december  and through the first nine months of  we were not in compliance with certain of the debt covenants and obtained necessary waivers of default from the lender 
as of december  the subordinated debt covenants have been modified and the company is in compliance as of that date 
in connection with the revised covenants the company has agreed to a further subordinated note repayment of  in april although we believe that we will be able to satisfy the covenants as modified  our failure to meet our financial plan could result in our breach of certain of the covenants 
if we breach any of these covenants and are not successful in obtaining a waiver  the noteholder could demand immediate repayment of the note 
in addition  in the event of a breach of certain of the covenants  the interest rate we owe in connection with the debt may increase 
we may seek to refinance this debt 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to refinance on terms that are favorable to us or at all 
we may face difficulties in satisfying our future capital requirements 
in the event that we are unable to obtain access to additional capital on terms that are favorable to us or at all  we may fail to meet our financial plan 
moreover  our failure to meet our financial plan could result in our breach of certain debt covenants 
our capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including 
product sales  
progress of research and development programs and preclinical and clinical testing  
cost and time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and 
unanticipated needs for capital  such as a successful claim for indemnification by the buyer of our neurosurgical instruments business against us under the purchase agreement 
we may face challenges maintaining our nasdaq national market listing 
on january   we received a delisting notification from the nasdaq national market for failure to maintain net tangible assets of at least million 
we appealed this determination and  on march   we appeared before a hearing panel of the nasdaq national market and presented evidence of our ability to meet the nasdaq national market maintenance requirements 
although we believe that we will continue to meet the requirements for inclusion on the nasdaq national market  we cannot assure you that the panel will find in our favor 
if the panel decides to delist us  we will be removed immediately from the nasdaq national market without prior notification 
if we are delisted  we will have constrained access to capital markets and you may find it more difficult to buy and sell our securities 
we may face challenges in refocusing our business strategy 
in connection with the commercialization of our cardioseal r product  and the recent sale of a portion of our neurosciences business unit  we have had to refocus our business strategy 
this refocusing has placed significant demands on a new senior management team and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage and implement our refocused business strategy effectively  including by 
developing and improving our operational  financial and other internal systems  
improving our sales and marketing capabilities  and 
continuing to train  motivate and manage our employees 
we may face uncertainties with respect to commercialization  product development and market acceptance of our products 
before certain of our products can be marketed and sold in the united states  including our cardioseal r product  we may be required to conduct further research  product development  preclinical and clinical testing and obtain additional governmental regulatory approvals 
we cannot be certain that our current products  or products currently under development  will achieve or continue to have market acceptance 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by surgery  drugs or other medical devices 
currently  the medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments  and these other treatments have a long history of use 
we cannot be certain that our devices and procedures will be able to replace such established treatments or that either physicians or the medical community  in general  will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop additional products 
even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits  the cost of commercializing that product candidate may be too high to justify development 
in addition  competitors may develop products that are more effective  cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products 
if we are unable to develop additional  commercially viable products  our future prospects will be limited 
we may be unable to compete successfully because of intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
existing and future products  therapies  technological approaches and delivery systems will continue to compete directly with our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  greater research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and experience and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  new surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current or future procedures that utilize our products 
as a result  any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with development of these products 
our future success may depend in part upon maintenance of business relationships with collaborators 
we have entered into distribution agreements with each of bard radiology and bard international granting them exclusive distribution rights to our snf  and into a license agreement with boston scientific granting boston scientific exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  market and distribute our stent technology  along with products incorporating such technology 
although each of bard radiology and bard international has agreed not to sell competing filters  boston scientific is not prohibited from selling other stents and  in fact  manufactures and licenses from others a variety of stents that may compete with our stents 
boston scientific may choose to emphasize such other stents in its developmental and marketing efforts 
we cannot be certain that our arrangements will be renewed or that our existing relationships with the companies will continue in their current form 
in august  the company filed a demand for arbitration relating to the distribution agreement with bard radiology 
our business could be materially adversely affected if these arrangements prove unsuccessful or if these companies terminate their arrangements with us  negotiate lower prices  sell additional competing products  whether manufactured by themselves or others  or otherwise alter the nature of their relationships with us 
our limited manufacturing history  dependence on third party manufacturers and the possibility of non compliance with manufacturing regulations raise uncertainties with respect to our ability to commercialize future products 
we use third parties to manufacture and distribute certain of our products 
if our third party manufacturers experience delays or difficulties in producing  packaging or distributing our products  market introduction and subsequent sales of such products would be adversely affected  and we might have to seek alternative sources of supply 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to commercialize medical products as planned 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards including  but not limited to  good manufacturing practice and iso these regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production or purchasing costs and may even prevent us from making or obtaining our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we  or a third party manufacturer  change our approved manufacturing process  the fda will require a new approval before that process could be used 
failure to develop our manufacturing capabilities may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably  as a result of delays and additional capital investment costs 
we may be unable to successfully market our products due to limited marketing and sales experience 
our neurosurgical implants and cardiac septal repair devices are marketed through our direct sales force and distributors 
because we have marketed our initial products such as stents and vena cava filters through third parties  we have limited experience marketing our products directly 
in order to market directly the cardioseal r septal occluder and any related products  we will have to continue to develop a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may face intellectual property infringement claims 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be certain that 
any pending patent applications or any future patent application will result in issued patents  
the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us  
any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or 
others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by us 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that others have not or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of our products or design around any patents issued or that may be issued in the future to us or to our licensors 
whether or not patents are issued to us or to our licensors  others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by us 
we could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our issued us patents  and corresponding foreign patents  expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent 
as a result of government regulations  we may experience lower sales and earnings 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices intended for commercial distribution are subject to extensive governmental regulations in the united states 
medical devices generally require pre market clearance or pre market approval prior to commercial distribution 
certain material changes or modifications to medical devices are also subject to regulatory review and clearance or approval 
the regulatory approval process is expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
in addition  any products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the fda 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis or at all 
the occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  regulatory approvals or clearances  
the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  
limitations on the intended use of a device imposed as a condition of regulatory approvals or clearances  or 
our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
in addition  sales of medical device products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face uncertainties with respect to the availability of third party reimbursement 
in the united states  medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as private insurance reimbursement programs  greatly affect revenues for suppliers of health care products and services 
such third party payors may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount  if any  of reimbursement which they provide to the physicians and clinics using our devices  or any other products that we may develop 
if  for any reason  the third party payors decided not to provide reimbursement for our products  this would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
moreover  mounting concerns about rising health care costs may cause the government or private insurers to implement more restrictive coverage and reimbursement policies in the future 
in the international market  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers and by governmental insurers and providers varies from country to country 
in certain countries  our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party governmental reimbursement 
product liability claims  product recalls and uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the testing  marketing and sale of implantable devices and materials carry an inherent risk that users will assert product liability claims against us or our third party distributors 
in these lawsuits  users might allege that their use of our devices had adverse effects on their health
