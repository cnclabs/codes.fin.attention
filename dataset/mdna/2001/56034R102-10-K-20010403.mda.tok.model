for the years ended december   and overview main street s net income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
basic earnings per share were  and for the same periods  respectively  and diluted earnings per share were  and for the same periods 
earnings growth from to and from to resulted principally from an increase in earning assets in a rising interest rate environment 
earnings growth was further augmented by an increase in non interest income which resulted from the addition and growth of several fee based business lines 
on an operating basis  which excludes the impact of merger related expenses and other onetime gains losses pertaining to restructuring the investment portfolio and sales of property  the company s net earnings were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

at the same time  total deposits were million and million 
loans  net of unearned income  totaled million and million for the two year end dates 
from year end to year end  the company experienced loan and deposit growth of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
shareholder s equity was million and million december  and  respectively 
results of operations net interest income 
net interest income for was million compared to million in  an increase of or million 
the increase in net interest income was largely the result of overall balance sheet growth and the corresponding increase in average interest earning assets which grew over the december  level 
growth in average loans of provided the bulk of the increase in earning assets and contributed most significantly to the growth in net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  yields on earning assets climbed throughout the year  but did not rise sufficiently to offset the increased cost of deposits and borrowings 
the resulting shrinkage in net interest spread and net interest margin was due to intense competition for time deposits in the company s local markets and an increasing mix of time deposits required to fund asset growth 
while interest earning assets yielded in versus in a basis point increase  the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to 
net interest income for was million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase was produced solely by growth in interest earning assets  as the relatively stable interest rate environment allowed the company to maintain its relatively constant spreads and margins 
average earning assets grew from million to million  an increase which was driven significantly by average loan growth from to the following table presents the total dollar amount of average balances  interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates

to make pre tax income and resultant yields on tax exempt investments comparable to those on taxable investments  a tax equivalent adjustment has been computed using a federal income tax rate of 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
the following schedule presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and distinguishes between the change related to higher outstanding balances and the change in interest rates

management s policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
in determining inherent losses  management considers financial services industry trends  conditions of individual borrowers  historical loan loss experience and the general economic environment 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  representing of outstanding loans  compared to million or of outstanding loans as of december  the provision for loan losses charged against earnings was million in compared to million in  an increase of  net loans charged off in was  compared to  in and  in the provision of million was  higher than the provision of million made in non interest income 
for  non interest income totaled million  an increase of  over non interest income of million in excluding a merger related restructuring of the company s investment portfolio and the resulting pretax loss of  non interest income totaled million which represented a increase over the growth in fee income is mainly a result of higher service charges on and the growth in number of demand deposit accounts 
the increase is also attributed to the growth in the company s investment brokerage and insurance services 
non interest income in increased million over the million total for this increase is again the result of growth in demand deposit accounts  increased pricing on these accounts and growth in the company s investment and insurance business lines

occupancy and equipment costs also rose due to the new banking facilities 
with rapid growth in its market  the company believes that the opening of de novo banking facilities is a prudent strategy to employ on a limited basis 
comparing to  non interest expenses rose with higher salaries and employee benefits constituting the largest portion of this increase 
personnel related costs rose from million to million or a increase 
occupancy and equipment increased 
these increases were mainly the result of new banking offices and the construction and opening of a new operations center 
professional fees grew from  to  due largely to the company s use of consulting firms to conduct a staffing efficiency study  a margin improvement program and a review of interest bearing product profitability 
income taxes 
income tax expense includes both federal income tax and georgia state income tax 
the amount of federal income tax expense is influenced by the amount of taxable income  the amount of tax exempt income and the amount of non deductible expenses

the growth in the loan portfolio was attributable to a consistent focus on quality loan production and strong loan markets in the state and region 
the bank s loan portfolio experienced growth in all major categories of loans at december  real estate construction loans increased million or from december  there was also a strong increase in commercial and industrial loans from december  to december   with an increase of million or 
the company continues to monitor the composition of the loan portfolio to ensure that the market risk to the balance sheet is not adversely affected by the impact of changes in the economic environment on any one segment of the portfolio 
the following table summarizes the loan portfolio of main street banks by type of loan december dollars in thousands commercial and industrial      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer and other      mortgage loans held for sale    percent of loans by category to total loans excluding loans held for sale commercial and industrial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer and other to accomplish main street s lending objectives  management seeks to achieve consistent loan growth within its primary market areas while maximizing loan yields and maintaining a high quality loan portfolio 
main street banks monitors its lending objectives primarily through its eastern and western division senior loan committees 
in addition to the senior loan committees  larger credits are reviewed by the banks executive loan committee 
main street s lending objectives are clearly defined in its lending policy  which is reviewed annually and approved by the board of directors 
the senior loan committee in each division is chaired by that division s credit officer 
members of the senior loan committee include the president of main street bank  regional executives from the respective divisions  its risk management officer and various lending officers 
the executive loan committee is chaired by the president of the bank  and it includes the division senior credit officers and the risk management officer 
generally  all loans with total related debt of between  and  are reviewed for approval by the senior loan committee 
however  for certain loans that have been identified as low risk loans  ie  residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  the division executives have approval authority up to  the next level of approval authority rests with the executive loan committee  which has approval authority for loan relationships with committed debt of  the company has established an internal limit of  and any relationship which exceeds this limit must be approved by the board of directors 
the board of directors is generally responsible for ratifying the actions of the senior loan committee and the executive loan committee and serving as the ultimate approval authority for single advances or total commitments over million 
additionally  main street banks board of directors is responsible for approving all new loan requests for which a borrower s total debt exceeds million 
main street banks primarily focuses on the following loan categories commercial  real estate construction  real estate mortgage and consumer loans 
main street banks management has strategically located its branches in high growth markets and has taken advantage of a surge in residential and industrial growth in northeastern georgia 
real estate mortgage lending has significantly contributed to main street s loan growth during the past several years 
generally  these loans are owner occupied and are amortized over a year to year period with a three to five year maturity 
the underwriting criteria for these loans is very similar to the underwriting criteria used in the mortgage industry 
typically  a borrower s debt to income ratio can not exceed and the loan to appraised value ratio cannot exceed 
however  main street s knowledge of its customers and its market allows the company to be more flexible in meeting its customers needs 
main street also underwrites commercial mortgage loans 
loans included in this category are primarily for the acquisition or refinancing of owner occupied commercial buildings 
these loans are underwritten on the borrower s ability to meet certain minimum debt service requirements and the value of the underlying collateral to meet certain loan to value guidelines 
main street banks also perfects its interest in equipment or other business assets of the borrower and obtains personal guaranties 
main street also underwrites loans to finance the construction of residential and non residential properties which include speculative and pre sale loans 
speculative construction loans involve a higher degree of risk  as these are made on the basis that a borrower will be able to sell the project to a potential buyer after a project is completed 
pre sale construction loans usually have a pre qualified buyer under contract before construction is to begin 
the major risk for pre sale loans is getting the project completed in a timely manner and according to plan specifications 
non residential construction loans include construction loans for churches  commercial buildings  strip shopping centers  and acquisition and development loans 
these loans also carry a higher degree of risk and require strict underwriting guidelines 
all construction loans are secured by first liens on real estate and generally have floating interest rates 
main street conducts periodic inspections either directly or through an agent prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
as an underwriting guideline  management focuses on the borrower s past experience in completing projects in a timely manner and the borrowers financial condition with special emphasis placed on liquidity ratios 
although construction loans are deemed to be of higher risk  main street believes that it can monitor and manage this risk properly 
main street also underwrites commercial and industrial loans 
generally  these loans are for working capital purposes and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable or equipment 
main street maintains strict underwriting standards for this type of lending 
potential borrowers must meet certain working capital and debt ratios as well as generate positive cash flow from operations 
borrowers in this category will generally have a debt service coverage ratio of at least to main street will also perfect its interest in equipment or other business assets of the borrower and obtain personal guaranties 
main street banks does not originate and does not currently hold in its portfolio any foreign loans 
main street is also an active participant in the origination of small business administration sba loans 
these loans are solicited from the company s market areas  and are generally underwritten in the same manner as conventional loans generated for the company s portfolio 
the portion of loans that are secured by the guaranty of the sba may from time to time be sold in the secondary market to provide additional liquidity  and to provide a source for fee income 
consumer loans include automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  home improvement loans  home equity loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of the loan 
consumer loans involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans 
this is due to the fact that these loans may be unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial and industrial and real estate construction portfolios and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december  are summarized as follows after one one year or year through after five less five years years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     real estate construction     total     loans with a predetermined interest rate     loans with a floating interest rate     total     non performing assets 
main street has formal procedures in place to assist management in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
main street has established written guidelines contained in its lending policy for the collection of past due loan accounts 
these guidelines explain in detail main street s policy on the collection of loans over   and days delinquent 
generally  loans over days delinquent are placed in a non accrual status 
however  if the loan is deemed to be in process of collection  it may be maintained on an accrual basis 
main street s management has effective credit management processes to make officers aware of its lending policy and the collection policy contained therein on a continuous basis 
main street s management has also staffed its collection department with properly trained staff to assist lenders with collection efforts and to maintain records and develop reports on delinquent borrowers 
main street s lending approach  as well as a healthy local economy  has resulted in strong asset quality 
main street had non performing assets of million  million  and million as of december   and  respectively 
for  and  the gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded on non performing loans  if all such loans had been accruing interest at the original contract rate  was approximately   and  respectively 
management is not aware of any loans that meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring as of december  or main street banks records real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lesser of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value at the time of foreclosure  less estimated cost to sell 
main street usually disposes of real estate acquired through foreclosure within one year  however  if it is unable to dispose of the foreclosed property  the property s value is assessed annually and written down to its fair value less cost to sell

management is not aware of any potential problem loans other than those noted in the table above 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the economic environment  the history of charged off loans and recoveries  size and composition of the loan portfolio  non performing and past due loans  and other aspects of the loan portfolio 
main street s management has established an allowance for loan losses which it believes is adequate for anticipated losses in its loan portfolio 
based on a continuous credit evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to main street s board of directors 
the review that management has developed primarily focuses on risk by evaluating the level of loans in certain risk categories 
these categories have also been established by management and take the form of loan grades 
these loan grades closely mirror regulatory classification guidelines and include pass loan categories through and special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss categories of through  respectively 
by grading the loan portfolio in this manner  main street s management is able to effectively evaluate the portfolio by risk  which management believes is the most effective way to analyze the loan portfolio and thus analyze the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
also  main street s management reviews activity in the allowance for loan losses  such as charge offs and recoveries  during each quarter to identify trends 
main street s credit management processes include a loan review program as one of the processes to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
through the loan review process  main street maintains an internally critized classified loan list which  along with the delinquency report of loans  which serves as a tool to assist management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources  or poor financial condition which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but have an increased risk of loss  or at least a portion of the loan may require being charged off 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
for the year ended  net charge offs totaled  or of average loans outstanding for the period  net of unearned income  compared to  or in net charge offs during main street s net charge offs totaled  or of average loans  net of unearned income  outstanding in main street recorded a provision for loan losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans  net of unearned income 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans  net of unearned income 
the following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data years ended december dollars in thousands average loans outstanding net of unearned income      total loans  net of unearned income  at end of period      allowance for loan losses at beginning of period      provision for loans losses      charge offs commercial and industrial real estate consumer recoveries commercial and industrial real estate consumer net charge offs allowance for loan losses at end of period      ratio of allowance to end of period loans ratio of net charge offs to average loans ratio of allowance to end of period non performing loans the following tables describe the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur

where management is able to identify specific loans or categories of loans where specific amounts of reserve are required  allocations are assigned to those categories 
federal and state bank regulators also require that a bank maintain a reserve that is sufficient to absorb an estimated amount of unidentified potential losses based on management s perception of economic conditions  loan portfolio growth  historical charge off experience and exposure concentrations 
main street believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of such date 
there can be no assurance that main street will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at december  the allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance for loan losses in comparison to a group of peer banks identified by the regulators 
during their routine examinations of banks  the fdic and the georgia department of banking may require a bank to make additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses when  in the opinion of the regulators  credit evaluations and allowance for loan loss methodology differ materially from those of management 
while it is the bank s policy to charge off in the current period loans for which a loss is considered probable there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
investment securities 
main street uses its securities portfolio both as a source of income and as a source of liquidity 
at december   investment securities totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  at december   investment securities represented of total assets  compared to of total assets at december  the average yield on a fully taxable equivalent basis on the investment portfolio for the year ended december  was compared to a yield of for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  at december   investment securities represented of total deposits and of total assets 
approximately million or of investment securities reprice within one year

these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
at december   of the mortgage backed securities main street held had contractual final maturities of more than ten years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
mortgage backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
conversely  these securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be unduly shortened 
if interest rates begin to fall  prepayments will increase  and the average life of these securities will decrease 
main street has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at the date of purchase  main street is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
main street does not have any securities classified as trading securities 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  until realized 
deposits 
main street offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
main street s deposits consist of demand  savings  money market and time accounts 
main street relies primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
main street has a limited amount of brokered deposits 
main street s lending and investing activities are funded principally by deposits  approximately of which are demand  money market and savings deposits

interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
main street banks asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the necessary guidelines for effective funds management and a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position 
main street manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee which is composed of senior officers of main street  in accordance with policies approved by its board of directors 
the asset liability committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the asset liability committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
the asset liability committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activities  commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the asset liability committee reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
main street banks management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
main street banks has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates 
main street manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
main street banks has in the past  and may utilize interest rate swaps  financial options  or financial futures contracts in order to reduce interest rate risk 
no such interest rate protection instruments were in effect at the end of an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for main street at december  volumes subject to repricing within after one days days days year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities      loans      mortgage loans held for sale   interest bearing deposits in banks federal funds sold and short term investments   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities demand  money market and savings deposits      time deposits      borrowings     total interest bearing liabilities      period gap      cumulative gap     period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets shortcomings are inherent in any gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
in addition to gap analysis  main street banks uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet  respectively 
contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions  maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio 
assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for non maturity deposit accounts 
based on main street s december  simulation analysis  the simulation model estimates that a basis point rise or decline in rates over the next month period would have an adverse impact of no more than on its net interest income for the period 
the change is relatively small  despite the company s asset sensitive position 
as a financial institution  main street s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of main street banks assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of main street s operations  it is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
main street banks does not own investment securities held as trading assets 
main street banks exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
main street banks management recognizes these inherent risks and has structured processes and systems to identify  measure and control these risks 
liquidity involves main street banks ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis 
during the past three years  main street banks liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits  as previously discussed  together with advances from the federal home loan bank 
although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities  main street banks does not generally rely on these external funding sources 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios  have generally created an adequate liquidity position 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation on the local economy and on main street banks operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
main street banks attempts to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
changes in interest rates will affect the volume of loans generated and the values of investment securities and collateral held 
increasing interest rates such as those experienced in generally decrease the value of securities and collateral and reduce loan demand  especially the demand for real estate loans 
declining interest rates tend to increase the value of securities and increase the demand for loans

capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
main street is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and main street bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic and the georgia department of banking and finance 
both the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve board require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve board has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
main street bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve board s guidelines 
also pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as main street bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under the fdic s regulations  main street bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action
