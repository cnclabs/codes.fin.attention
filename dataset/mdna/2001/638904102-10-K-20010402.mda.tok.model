as a result  the company wrote less than the capacity available 
the pricing competition showed some signs of easing in marine premium 
in  marine premium increased from due to the capacity provided to syndicate by ncul and millennium in the aggregate increasing from in to in the capacity provided to syndicate by ncul and millennium increased from in to in resulting in the increase in premium volume

the company makes estimates for each year and timely accrues the expected results 
at lloyd s  the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close 
at december   syndicate closed its underwriting year  the net effect of which resulted in a portfolio transfer to ncul and millennium of million at december  at december   syndicate and an unaffiliated syndicate on which ncul participated in closed their underwriting year resulting in a portfolio transfer to ncul of million at december  at december   syndicate and an unaffiliated syndicate on which ncul participated in  closed their underwriting year resulting in a portfolio transfer to ncul of million at december  these transactions accounted for part of the increases in the premium volume in the company s lloyd s operations 
the reinsurance to close transactions were recorded as additional written and earned premium  losses incurred  loss reserves and receivables  all in the same amount 
there were no gains or losses recorded on the transactions 
the company controlled of syndicate s capacity for the underwriting year 
the actual capacity was pound   of which the company directly controlled pound   or and indirectly controlled pound   or 
since the controlled capacity exceeded in  lloyd s mandatory byelaw no 
of required the company to make a mandatory offer to noncontrolled participants for their capacity at the first lloyd s capacity auctions beginning in july as a result  the company purchased an additional pound   of capacity for through the auction process in at a total cost of pound  
the offer was made at pence per pound of capacity which is the minimum price that the company was obliged to offer  being the highest price paid for capacity during the prior months 
if the company were to exceed the control threshold  lloyd s major syndicate transactions byelaw no 
of allows for a minority buy out to be effected 
in such a transaction the remaining participants are required to give up their capacity in return for compensation which must be at least equal to the offer price preceding the buy out 
syndicate s capacity for will be approximately pound million of which the company will directly control and indirectly control 
the company provides letters of credit to lloyd s to support its syndicate capacity 
if the amount of capacity controlled increases  the company will be required to supply additional letters of credit or other collateral acceptable to lloyd s  or reduce the capacity of syndicate insurance companies marine premium 
marine gross written premium remained relatively unchanged from to written premium increased from to primarily due to navigators insurance increasing its participation in the marine pool 
navigators insurance s participation in the marine pool was in and and in program insurance premium 
the program insurance  currently written by anfield  consists primarily of general liability insurance for contractors and a small amount of commercial multi peril insurance for restaurants and taverns 
the premium increased from to and from to due to the expansion of these programs 
aviation premium 
navigators insurance withdrew from aviation business effective october  other than a small amount of war and satellite business  due to inadequate pricing in the aviation insurance market 
onshore energy premium 
in  navigators insurance began to underwrite onshore energy insurance which principally focused on the oil and gas  chemical and petrochemical  and power generation industries with coverages primarily for property damage 
beginning in  the onshore energy business was written through the company s facilities at lloyd s 
engineering and construction premium 
in  navigators insurance began writing engineering and construction business consisting of coverage for construction projects including the machinery  equipment and loss of use due to delays 
beginning in  the engineering and construction business was written through the company s facilities at lloyd s 
in early  the company closed its somerset asia pacific limited office in australia which  along with navigators management uk  had previously produced this business for navigators insurance 
ceded written premium 
in the ordinary course of business  the company reinsures certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting its maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses  and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
the increase in ceded premium in the lloyd s operations during was due to the purchase of additional quota share protection in the marine business and increased gross written premium 
the insurance companies ceded premium declined from to primarily due to more favorable reinsurance rates in the program insurance 
the decrease in the ceded premium from to resulted from the decrease in engineering and aviation business which were heavily reinsured 
net written premium 
net written premium increased from to primarily due to the increases in the lloyd s marine business and the program business 
net written premium increased from to primarily due to increases in the marine premium partially offset by decreases in other lines of business as described above 
net earned premium 
net earned premium increased from to primarily due to the increase in the written premium 
the decrease from to was primarily due to higher unearned premium in the lloyd s operations and a smaller reinsurance to close premium in which is recorded as fully earned premium 
commission income 
commission income increased in primarily due to the absence to a great extent of the factors that reduced commission income in commission income decreased from to due to navigators insurance increasing its participation in the marine pool from in to in  the losses related to unrecoverable reinsurance which reduced the profit commission  the company s reduction of its commission income estimates due to the extremely competitive rate environment and less profit commission earned by mtc in than in net investment income 
net investment income increased from to and from to primarily due to an increase in investment income allocated to ncul and millennium from the investments at the lloyd s syndicates due to their increased participation in syndicate and reduction in the insurance companies municipal portfolio 
increased yield in the portfolio and reduction in the expenses to manage the portfolio also increased investment income in the investments at ncul and millennium are represented by funds due from the lloyd s syndicates to the company 
operating expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
the ratio of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred to net earned premium was   and in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the loss ratio compared to was primarily due to the unrecoverable reinsurance for new cap re recorded in and to the lower reinsurance to close premium in of million compared to million in the increase in the loss ratio compared to was primarily due to unrecoverable reinsurance from new cap re and higher loss ratios on the lloyd s premium  partially offset by the decrease in the reinsurance to close premium in of million compared to million in the reinsurance to close premium is recorded at a loss ratio since the premium received represents estimated ultimate losses 
the loss ratio excluding the new cap re unrecoverable reinsurance was 
the loss reserves were not discounted 
commission expense 
commission expense as a percentage of net earned premium was  and for   and  respectively 
the same ratios without the reinsurance to close premium were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the commission expense ratio compared to was primarily due to the increase in the lloyd s premium which generally has a higher commission expense 
the reinsurance to close premium increases earned premium but does not change the commission expense  therefore the ratio of commission expense to earned premium decreases 
the increase in the commission expense ratio compared to was also primarily due to increased commissions at lloyd s 
other operating expenses 
the change in other operating expenses from to was minimal 
other operating expenses increased from to primarily due to the acquisition of anfield on april  and increased expenses in the lloyd s operations due to the company s increased participation in its lloyd s syndicate  partially offset by reduced expenses from the closing of the somerset asia pacific limited office in australia from which the company incurred a foreign exchange loss of  interest expense 
the increase in interest expense from to was primarily due to higher interest rates charged on the loan balance 
income taxes 
the income tax expense benefit was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for   and were  and  respectively 
the tax benefit in compared to the tax expense in was primarily due to operating losses in the company had alternative minimum tax amt carryforwards of million  million and million at december    and  respectively 
the amt carryforwards were primarily attributable to the tax benefits from municipal bond interest 
the company began reducing its municipal bond portfolio in as of december  and  the net deferred federal  foreign  state and local tax asset was million and million  respectively 
at december  the company had a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset compared to a million valuation allowance at december  the valuation allowance is necessitated by the uncertainty associated with the realization of the deferred tax asset for the carryforward of operating losses from certain of the company s foreign  state and local operations 
net income loss 
the company had net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in and net income of million in the loss in was primarily due to unrecoverable reinsurance  price competition  higher loss ratios in the lloyd s operations and expenses related to the foreign expansion in london 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by used in operations was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
operating cash flow in and was used primarily to acquire additional investment assets and to reduce debt 
the negative operating cash flow in was primarily due to the payment of loss reserves on runoff business and less premiums received  partially due to lloyd s disbursing cash only after an underwriting year has closed  normally three years later 
invested assets and cash increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio moving from a million unrealized loss at december  to a million unrealized gain at december  net investment income was million in  million in and million in the average yield of the portfolio  excluding net realized capital gains  was in  in  and in reflecting the prevailing interest rates during those years  the decrease in the tax exempt portfolio and reduction in expenses to manage the portfolio in as of december   all fixed maturity securities and equity securities held by the company were classified as available for sale 
the average rating of the company s fixed maturity investments is aa by standard poor s and aa by moody s 
the company has no significant exposure to credit risk since the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio primarily consists of investment grade bonds 
the portfolio has an average maturity of approximately seven years 
management continually monitors the composition and cash flow of the investment portfolio in order to maintain the appropriate levels of liquidity 
this ensures the company s ability to satisfy claims 
the decrease in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and the related decrease in the reinsurance receivable on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  as compared to was primarily due to the payment of reserves and recovery of reinsurance during on various large energy and aviation claims 
on december   the company entered into a new bank credit facility which replaced the prior facility 
the new credit facility  as amended on september   provides a million revolving line of credit at an interest rate of either  at the company s election  the base commercial lending rate of one of the banks or at libor plus on the used portion of the line of credit 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit is 
the line of credit facility reduces each quarter by amounts between million and million beginning january  until it terminates on november  at december  and  million and million in loans were outstanding  respectively  under the revolving line of credit facility at an interest rate of and  respectively 
the credit facility also provides for a million letter of credit facility which is utilized primarily by ncul and millennium to participate in lloyd s syndicate managed by mtc 
the cost of the letters of credit is for the used portion and for the unused portion of the letter of credit facility 
at december  and  letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million and million  respectively  were issued under the letter of credit facility 
in   of these letters of credit were drawn upon 
the bank credit facility is collateralized by shares of common stock of the company s major subsidiary 
it contains covenants common to transactions of this type  including restrictions on indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers and the sale of assets  maintaining certain consolidated total stockholders equity  statutory surplus  minimum liquidity  loss reserves and other financial ratios 
at december   the company complied with all covenants 
total stockholders equity was million at december   a increase for the year as the result of the company s net income in and the unrealized gain in the investment portfolio 
the company s reinsurance has been placed with various us companies rated a or better by us best company  as well as with foreign insurance companies and with selected syndicates of lloyd s 
pursuant to the implementation of lloyd s plan of reconstruction and renewal  a portion of the company s recoverables are now reinsured by equitas a separate uk authorized reinsurance company established to reinsure outstanding liabilities of all lloyd s members for all risks written in the or prior years of account 
the company believes that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of the company s subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for the company to meet its liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to the company may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
economic conditions the company is a specialty insurance company and periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct affect on the company s underwriting operations 
they do  however  impact the company s investment portfolio 
a decrease in interest rates will tend to decrease the company s yield and have a positive effect on the fair value of its invested assets 
an increase in interest rates will tend to increase the company s yield and have a negative effect on the fair value of its invested assets 
management considers the potential impact of these economic trends in estimating loss reserves 
management believes that the underwriting controls it maintains  and the fact that the majority of the company s business is in lines of insurance which have relatively short loss payout patterns  assist in estimating ultimate claim costs more reasonably and lessen the potential adverse impact of the economy on the company 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  the company s market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio as of december  was million of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the company s exposure to equity price risk and foreign exchange risk is not significant 
the company has no commodity risk 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
for the company s investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its notes payable to banks as changes in interest rates would impact future earnings  however  this interest rate risk exposure is not considered significant 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss amount only reflects the impact on an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s fixed maturities and short term investments  which constitute approximately of total assets as of december  based on the sensitivity analysis model used by the company  the loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments  as a result of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  is not material
