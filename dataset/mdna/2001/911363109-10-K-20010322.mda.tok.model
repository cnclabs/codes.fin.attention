accordingly  while continuing to purchase new equipment  the company will also selectively purchase late model used equipment 
the company estimates that over the next months used equipment will account for of its total equipment purchases 
the company plans to reduce the rate at which it invests in new equipment in  which will cause the weighted average age of its fleet to increase from approximately months to approximately months 
the company believes that  because of the young age of its fleet  the company s operations will not be adversely affected by this six month increase in average age 
the company also plans to reduce the rate at which it sells its used rental equipment in and  as a result  revenues from the sale of rental equipment are expected to be lower in than in close or consolidate under performing branches

fluctuations in operating results the company expects that its revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term 
certain of the general factors that may cause such fluctuations are discussed under factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forward looking statements fluctuations of operating results 
in addition  information concerning certain projected charges that may impact quarterly results over the near term is set forth under certain projected charges 
the company is continually involved in the investigation and evaluation of potential acquisitions 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company capitalizes certain direct out of pocket expenditures such as legal and accounting fees relating to potential or pending acquisitions 
indirect acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead  public affairs and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
the company s policy is to charge against earnings any capitalized expenditures relating to any potential or pending acquisition that the company determines will not be consummated 
there can be no assurance that the company in future periods will not be required to incur a charge against earnings in accordance with such policy  which charge  depending upon the magnitude thereof  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company will be required to incur significant start up expenses in connection with establishing each start up location 
such expenses may include  among others  pre opening expenses related to setting up the facility  and expenses in connection with training employees  installing information systems and marketing 
the company expects that  in general  start up locations will initially operate at a loss or at less than normalized profit levels 
consequently  the opening of a start up location may negatively impact the company s margins until the location achieves normalized profitability 
there may be a lag between the time that the company purchases new equipment and begins to incur the related depreciation and interest expenses and the time that the equipment begins to generate revenues at normalized rates 
as a result  the purchase of new equipment  particularly equipment purchased in connection with expanding and diversifying the company s rental equipment  may periodically reduce margins 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal with demand for the company s rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months 
the seasonality of the company s business has been heightened by the company s acquisition of businesses that specialize in renting traffic control equipment 
these businesses tend to generate most of their revenues and profits in the second and third quarters of the year  slow down during the fourth quarter and operate at a loss during the first quarter 
inflation although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  the company believes that inflation has not had  and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on its results of operations

is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors that may influence future results and accuracy of forward looking statements sensitivity to changes in construction and industrial activities our equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities 
consequently  a downturn in construction or industrial activity may lead to a decrease in demand for our equipment  which could adversely affect our business 
we have identified below certain of the factors which may cause such a downturn  either temporarily or long term 
the recent slow down of the economy worsens or continues over the long term  
an increase in interest rates  or 
adverse weather conditions which may temporarily affect a particular region 
in addition  demand for our traffic control equipment may not reach projected levels in the event that funding for highway and other construction projects under government programs  such as the transportation equity act for the st century tea  does not reach expected levels 
fluctuations of operating results we expect that our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors  including 
seasonal rental patterns of our customers with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter  
our recent acquisitions of businesses that specialize in renting traffic control equipment  which tend to operate at a loss during the first quarter  
the timing of expenditures for new equipment and the disposition of used equipment  
changes in demand for our equipment or the prices therefor due to changes in economic conditions  competition or other factors  
changes in the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt  
if we determine that a potential acquisition will not be consummated  the need to charge against earnings any expenditures relating to such transaction such as financing commitment fees  merger and acquisition advisory fees and professional fees previously capitalized  and 
the possible need  from time to time  to take other write offs or special charges due to a variety of occurrences  such as store consolidations or closings or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
dependence on additional capital we may require additional capital for  among other purposes  purchasing rental equipment  completing acquisitions  and establishing new rental locations 
if the cash that we generate from our business  together with cash that we may borrow under our credit facility  is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements  we will require additional debt and or equity financing 
we cannot  however  be certain that any additional financing will be available or  if available  will be available on terms that are satisfactory to us 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future  our business could be adversely affected 
certain risks relating to acquisitions the making of acquisitions entails certain risks  including 
acquired companies could have unrecorded liabilities that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations  
we may have difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company with our existing operations  
we may lose key employees of the acquired company  and 
we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
dependence on management we are highly dependent upon our senior management team 
consequently  our business could be adversely affected in the event that we lose the services of any member of senior management 
furthermore  if we lose the services of certain members of senior management  it is an event of default under the agreements governing our credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness  unless we appoint replacement officers satisfactory to the lenders within days 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to members of senior management 
competition the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive 
our competitors primarily include small  independent businesses with one or two rental locations  regional competitors which operate in one or more states  public companies or divisions of public companies  and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers 
we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new companies 
in addition  certain equipment manufacturers may commence or increase their existing efforts relating to renting and selling equipment directly to our customers 
liability and insurance we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business 
these include claims relating to personal injury or death caused by equipment rented or sold by us  motor vehicle accidents involving our delivery and service personnel and employment related claims 
we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations 
however  such insurance may not fully protect us for a number of reasons  including 
our coverage is subject to a deductible of million and limited to a maximum of million per occurrence  
we do not maintain coverage for environmental liability  since we believe that the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit that it provides  and 
certain types of claims  such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct  which are often alleged in third party lawsuits  might not be covered by our insurance 
we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms  if at all 
environmental and safety regulations there are numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters 
these include laws and regulations that govern wastewater discharges  the use  treatment  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
under these laws  an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for  among other things  the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on  in  or emanating from  the real estate  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage and substantial penalties  and environmental contamination at facilities where its waste is or has been disposed 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or lessee knew of the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not the owner or lessee was responsible for these substances 
our activities that are or may be affected by these laws include our use of hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment and our disposal of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing 
we also dispense petroleum products from underground and above ground storage tanks located at certain rental locations  and at times we must remove or upgrade tanks to comply with applicable laws 
furthermore  we have acquired or lease certain locations which have or may have been contaminated by leakage from underground tanks or other sources and are in the process of assessing the nature of the required remediation 
based on the conditions currently known to us  we believe that any unreserved environmental remediation and compliance costs required with respect to those conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  we cannot be certain that we will not identify adverse environmental conditions that are not currently known to us  that all potential releases from underground storage tanks removed in the past have been identified  or that environmental and safety requirements will not become more stringent or be interpreted and applied more stringently in the future 
if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated by us  our business could be adversely affected depending on the magnitude of the cost 
risks related to international operations our operations outside the united states are subject to risks normally associated with international operations 
these include the need to convert currencies  which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates  and the need to comply with foreign laws 
dependence on information technology systems our ability to monitor and control our operations depends to a large extent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems 
any disruption in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could  depending on the magnitude and duration of the problem  adversely affect our business 
labor matters certain of our employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements 
if we should experience a prolonged labor dispute involving a significant number of our employees  our business could be adversely affected 
restrictive covenants the agreements governing our existing long term indebtedness contain  and future agreements governing our long term indebtedness may also contain  certain restrictive financial and operating covenants which affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  make prepayments of certain indebtedness  make investments  create liens  make acquisitions  sell assets and engage in mergers and consolidations 
these covenants may significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 
interest rate risk 
the company periodically utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the effect of these agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to on million of term loan b 
all borrowings under our million credit facility bear interest at a variable rate of interest 
the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility was million as of december  our other variable rate debt primarily consists of a million term loan b  a million term loan c  a term loan d and million of receivables securitization described earlier 
the weighted average interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt as of december  were i for the credit facility  ii for the term loan b  iii for the term loan c  iv for the term loan d and v for the receivables securitization described earlier 
based upon the amount of variable debt that we had outstanding as of december  approximately billion in the aggregate  our net income would decrease by approximately million for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility from time to time 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the current level of our canadian operations  a change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings 
in addition  the company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its transaction exposures 
at december   the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes
