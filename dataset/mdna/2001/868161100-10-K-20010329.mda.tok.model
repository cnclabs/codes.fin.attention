any tables with data from or prior years represent amounts of the bank prior to being acquired by the company 
net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including investments and loans  exceeds interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is the principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned and rates paid  fee income from portfolio loans  the level of nonperforming loans and other non earning assets and the amount of noninterest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of

for the bank  the net interest margin was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the primary difference in the net interest margin for the company and the bank  is the note payable and senior notes of the company which lower the net interest margin from that of the bank 
for the year ended december   net interest income was million and the net interest margins for the company and the bank were and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income for over was primarily the result of higher levels of earning assets offsetting the affects of higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets averaged billion for compared to billion for  an increase of million or 
the bank s rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased to in from in  an increase of

service charges were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  and million for the year ended december  the increase in the number of transaction accounts and the related service fee generation is the primary reason for the growth in service charges and is largely due to the company s successful execution of its totally free checking program to the lower to middle income customers in the markets in which the company operates 
as demonstrated by the trend from through  management believes growth will continue as the number of transaction accounts increase and the rate charged per item is increased 
noninterest expense for the year ended december   noninterest expense totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million in the efficiency ratio  which is noninterest expense  excluding goodwill amortization  divided by the sum of noninterest income excluding securities transactions plus net interest income  for the year ended december   was  compared to in for the year ended december   noninterest expense was million and the efficiency ratio was 
salary and benefit expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increases during were due primarily to the hiring of additional personnel required to accommodate loan growth  expanded products and services  and additional branch offices 
occupancy expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of 
million  or  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the opening of four new retail banking branches and two new finance company offices 
major categories included in occupancy expense are building lease expense  depreciation expense  and maintenance expense 
income taxes income tax expense includes the regular federal income tax at the statutory rate plus the income tax component of the applicable franchise taxes 
the amount of federal income tax expense is influenced by the amount of taxable income  the amount of tax exempt income  the amount of nondeductible interest expense and the amount of other nondeductible expenses 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was million  a decrease of 
million or from million for the year ended december  due to higher levels of tax exempt income 
the effective tax rate for was compared to in  due primarily to increased income exempt from federal and state income taxes 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was million and the effective tax rate was 
impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
see financial condition interest rate sensitivity and liquidity below 
financial condition loan portfolio loans were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from billion at december  consistent with the company s historically high rate of growth  this increase is believed to be the result of the style of relationship banking featuring professional  attentive and responsive service to customers needs  and focusing on commercial lending to middle market companies and private banking for individuals 
additionally  financial institution mergers in the primary markets that the bank services have provided opportunities to attract under serviced customers

the company offers a variety of commercial lending products including term loans  lines of credit and equipment financing 
a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  both secured and unsecured  is made available to business for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements and the purchase of equipment 
the purpose of a particular loan determines its structure 
generally  the company s commercial loans are underwritten in the company s primary market area on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt from income 
as a general practice  the company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate  equipment or other assets 
working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long term assets 
a substantial portion of the company s real estate loans consists of single family residential mortgage loans collateralized by owner occupied properties located in the company s primary market area 
the company offers a variety of mortgage loan products  which generally are amortized over to years 
loans collateralized by single family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value 
the company requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance in the amount of the loan 
consumer loans made by the company include automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  home improvement loans  personal loans secured and unsecured and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of the loan 
a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent

nonperforming assets at december  were million  compared with million at december  the increase was primarily the result of three commercial real estate and construction relationships 
this resulted in a ratio of nonperforming assets to loans plus other real estate of  and 
as of year end and  respectively 
the following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      other real estate and foreclosed property total nonperforming assets      nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate 




the company has well developed procedures in place to maintain a high quality loan portfolio 
these procedures begin with approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors  low individual lending limits for officers  senior loan committee approval for large credit relationships and quality loan documentation procedures 
the loan review department identifies and analyzes weaknesses in the portfolio and reports credit risk grade changes on a quarterly basis to bank management and directors 
the company also maintains a well developed monitoring process for credit extensions 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers 
the company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends  and collection efforts are done on a centralized basis 
the company also has procedures to bring rapid resolution of non performing loans and prompt and orderly liquidation of real estate  automobiles and other forms of collateral 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory 
all loans past due days  however  are placed on nonaccrual status  unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual are recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection 
the company is sometimes required to revise a loan s interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring 
the company regularly updates appraisals on loans collateralized by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the company had no non government sponsored accruing loans that were contractually past due days or more 
however  the company continues to accrue interest for government sponsored loans such as fha insurance and va guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of accruing loans past due days or more was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
of the or more days past due and still accruing balances as of december   million represent the remaining principal balance of million of fha insured and va guaranteed mortgages purchased by the bank in june  the contract called for the bank to receive a pass through net yield of and the loans would be paid off upon foreclosure and the servicer s receipt of the individual claims from either fha or va 
the servicing of these loans has been terminated upon the default of the servicer  which subsequently filed for bankruptcy 
management believes that the remaining principal balance and interest on these loans will be collected with no material adverse impact to the bank 
the company records real estate acquired by foreclosure at the lesser of the outstanding loan balance  net of any reduction in basis  or the fair value at the time of foreclosure  less estimated costs to sell 
allowance for loan losses the following table presents  for the periods indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data years ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses at january      provision for loan losses      charge offs commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer      total charge offs      recoveries commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer    total recoveries    net charge offs     allowance for loan losses at december      allowance to period end loans net charge offs to average loans allowance to period end nonperforming loans the company continuously monitors its underwriting procedures in an attempt to maintain loan quality 
additionally  the company is executing a strategy of achieving more balance between the amount of commercial  mortgage  and consumer loans outstanding 
this strategy has resulted in growth of commercial  construction  commercial real estate  and consumer loans while maintaining a fairly stable level of mortgage loans 
automobile loans are the largest component of consumer loans which are summarized below direct indirect total the provisions to the allowance for loan losses are based on management s judgment and evaluation of the loan portfolio utilizing both objective and subjective criteria 
the objective criteria utilized by the company to assess the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and required additions to such reserve are an internal grading system  a peer group analysis  and a historical analysis 
in addition to these objective criteria  the company subjectively assesses adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the need for additions thereto  with consideration given to the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  national  regional and local business and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay or the value of collateral securing the loans  and other relevant factors 
the company s allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december  while management believes the current allowance is adequate  changing economic and other conditions may require future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses 
the company uses an internal credit grading system in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis assigns grades to all loans except owner occupied family residential loans and consumer loans 
graded loans are assigned to one of nine risk reserve allocation percentage 
the loan grade for each individual loan is determined by the loan officer at the time it is made and changed from time to time to reflect an ongoing assessment of loan risk 
loan grades are reviewed on specific loans from time to time by senior management and as part of the company s internal loan review process 
owner occupied family residential and consumer loans are assigned a reserve allocation percentage based on past due status and the level of cumulative net charge offs for the five preceding calendar years 
the sum of all reserve amounts determined by this methodology is utilized by management as the primary indicator of the appropriate reserve level 
the unallocated reserve generally serves to compensate for the uncertainty in estimating loan losses  including the possibility of changing risk ratings or specific reserve allocations 
the company subjectively assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by considering the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  national  regional and local business and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay or the value of collateral securing the loans  and other relevant factors 
although the company does not determine the overall allowance based upon the amount of loans in a particular type or category except in the case of owner occupied family residential and consumer installment loans  risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories are considered in assigning loan grades to individual loans 
these risk elements include the following for non farm non residential loans and multifamily residential loans  the debt service coverage ratio income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements  operating results of the owner in the case of owner occupied properties  the loan to value ratio  the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income  property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type  for construction and land development loans  the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or ability to lease property constructed for lease  the quality and nature of contracts for presale or preleasing if any  experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratios  for commercial and industrial loans  the operating results of the commercial  industrial or professional enterprise  the borrower s business  professional and financial ability and expertise  the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value  nature and marketability of collateral 
in addition  for each category the company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors 
management reviews the allowance on a quarterly basis to determine whether the amount of regular monthly provision should be increased or decreased or whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance 
the allowance is determined by management s assessment and grading of individual loans in the case of loans other than owner occupied family residential and consumer loans and specific reserves made for other categories of loans 
the total allowance amount is available to absorb losses across the company s entire portfolio 
the following tables describe the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated

charge offs for the years have primarily been in the indirect consumer loan portfolio 
investments the company s investment portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets 
it provides a significant source of revenue for the company and acts as a source of funding should the company experience unanticipated deposit withdrawals or loan demand 
at the date of purchase  the company is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that the company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale or trading and carried at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale are carried as a separate component of stockholders equity 
all investments held by the company as of december   and are classified as available for sale 
the following table presents the amortized cost and estimated market values for investment securities as of the dates shown

the weighted average yield on investments was in  in  and in during  the company purchased million of federal tax exempt municipal bonds 
with the anticipated growth in deposits and loans  management believes the securities portfolio will remain at approximately the december  level 
the company did not hold any securities classified as trading securities during  or the company has no mortgage backed securities that have been issued by non agency entities 
at december   of investments available for sale held by the company had final maturities of more than years 
at december   approximately million of the company s mortgage backed securities earned interest at floating rates and repriced within one year  and accordingly were less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase  but benefit less than fixed rate securities in value changes during a time of declining interest rates 
the following table summarizes the amortized cost  by contractual maturity  of investments including securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits and their weighted average tax equivalent yields

additionally  the company introduced a new product in late  treasury checking  an interest bearing demand account which was designed to attract higher balance accounts 
these transaction accounts have lower interest rates than certificates of deposit  which will tend to increase the company s net interest margin  and generate service charge income 
the company continues to experience growth in the noninterest bearing checking accounts and now accounts

information relating to these borrowings at december is summarized as follows dollars in thousands other short term borrowings average daily outstanding    year end    maximum month end balance during year    interest rate average year end interest rate sensitivity and liquidity asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to the company s overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews the company s liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  retail and institutional deposit activity  current market conditions  and interest rates on both a local and national level 
the company reports to the board of directors rate sensitive assets minus rate sensitive liabilities divided by total earning assets on a cumulative basis quarterly 
at december   this ratio was a positive 
the company estimates that a basis point change in interest rates would have no significant impact on its net interest income over a twelve month period 
the committee regularly reviews interest rate risk exposure by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
while the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on the measure 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
shortcomings are inherent in any gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  as the interest rate environment has become more volatile  the company s management has increased monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position and the effect of various interest rate environments on earnings 
us money market interest rate market presents the primary risk exposure to the company 
in measuring and managing interest rate risk  the company uses gap analysis  net interest income simulation  and economic value equity modeling 
the following table sets forth a gap interest rate sensitivity analysis for the bank as of december  assets and liabilities of the company have been excluded

cumulative gap to earning assets the gap sensitivity analysis shows when balances may be repriced 
net interest income  however  is also affected by how much the interest rates change for each of the balances 
for example  when national money market rates change  interest rates on the company s savings accounts may not change as much as interest rates on its commercial loans 
this is a limiting factor for the gap analysis 
management does not believe the note payable and the senior notes used to finance the acquisition of the bank have a significant impact on the company s interest rate exposure 
the note payable has a floating interest rate based upon libor 
the senior notes mature on april  and have a fixed interest rate 
the combination of these two financing options minimize the impact of the interest rate changes of the risk profile of the company 
as of december   the company s net interest income simulation model indicates that a parallel basis point increase in interest rates along the yield curve would lower net interest income by up to for the next months  while a basis point decrease would raise net interest income by up to 
the model includes balances  asset prepayment speeds  and the interest rate relationships among balances that management judges to be reasonable for the various interest rate environments 
differences in actual occurrences from these assumptions  as well as non parallel changes in the yield curve  may change the company s market risk exposure 
among the interest rate relationships  there are caps and floors on the bank s portfolio of adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the company manages its interest rate risk through investment in appropriate fixed and variable rate assets  acquisition of non rate sensitive core deposits  and adjustments in maturities of federal home loan bank advances 
the bank does not use off balance sheet instruments 
short and intermediate term interest rates have declined substantially since year end  while longer term interest rate have decreased moderately 
still  there is a slight inversion of the us treasury yield curve through two years  with a normal positive sloping curve thereafter 
the federal reserve may further ease money market conditions in upcoming months to counteract softness in economic conditions 
additionally  yields on non u 
s treasury securities all along the yield curve may have wider spreads relative to yields on us treasury securities than has generally been the case 
this would be caused by the reduced supply of us treasury securities due to the federal government s continuing budget surplus
