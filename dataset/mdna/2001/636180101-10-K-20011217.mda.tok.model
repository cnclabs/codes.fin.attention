item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
back to table of contents results of operations compared with the company s earnings were million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis in these earnings included a non cash impairment of oil and gas assets in the exploration and production segment in the amount of million after tax  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis  which is discussed below 
without this non cash asset impairment  earnings for would have been million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
this compares with earnings of million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
the increase in earnings of million exclusive of the non cash impairment was the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production  utility  pipeline and storage  and timber segments 
earnings were also positively impacted by a lower loss in the energy marketing segment 
these higher earnings were offset by losses in in the international segment and corporate operations compared to net income for this segment and these operations in furthermore  the all other category experienced an increased loss in compared to the higher loss in the all other category resulted primarily from a natural gas inventory write down by upstate energy inc upstate  the company s wholly owned subsidiary which is primarily engaged in wholesale natural gas marketing 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
discussion of asset impairment seneca  which follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas operations  is required to perform a quarterly ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  the present value of future revenues from seneca s oil and gas reserves is compared on a country by country basis with the book value of those reserves at the balance sheet date 
if the book value of the reserves in any country exceeds the present value of the associated future revenues  a non cash charge must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
as a result of low oil and gas prices at september   seneca was required to recognize a non cash impairment relating to its canadian properties of million pre tax or million after tax for the quarter ended september  compared with the company s earnings were million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis in this compares with earnings of million  or per common share per common share on a diluted basis 
the increase in earnings of million was the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production  utility  timber and international segments 
these higher earnings were offset in part by lower earnings in the pipeline and storage segment  the energy marketing segment which had a loss for the year and in corporate operations 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
earnings loss by segment year ended september thousands utility  pipeline and storage  exploration and production  international  energy marketing  timber  total reportable segments  all other  corporate total consolidated  exclusive of the non cash asset impairment  earnings for the exploration and production segment and total consolidated would have been  and  respectively 
utility revenues utility operating revenues year ended september thousands retail revenues residential  commercial  industrial  off system sales  transportation  other  utility throughput million cubic feet mmcf year ended september retail sales residential  commercial  industrial  off system sales  transportation  compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this resulted from an increase in retail and off system gas sales revenues of million and million  respectively 
other operating revenues also increased by million 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in transportation revenues of million 
the increase in retail gas revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of higher gas costs  coupled with an increase in retail sales volumes  as shown above 
the recovery of higher gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the increase in retail sales volumes was primarily the result of the migration of residential and small commercial customers from transportation service to retail service in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions  coupled with the impact of colder weather 
this migration from transportation service resulted from one marketer entering bankruptcy proceedings  another marketer exiting the residential market  and the conclusion of a marketer pilot program in pennsylvania 
off system sales revenues increased because of higher gas prices 
however  due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales were minimal 
the decrease in transportation revenues and volumes was primarily due to residential transportation customers switching back to retail sales customers and the fact that certain commercial and industrial customers were reducing usage due to a slowing economy and or were fuel switching 
the increase in other operating revenues was due primarily to million of various revenue reductions in that did not recur in of which million was offset by lower operation and maintenance o m expense in 
these revenue reductions related to the september  conclusion of the two year rate settlement approved by the state of new york public service commission nypsc 
in addition to these adjustments  a million lower provision for refund was recorded in as compared with the provision for refund in related to the conclusion of the two year rate settlement and the provision for refund in relates to the current three year rate settlement approved by the nypsc in october the final refund for the current settlement will not be known until revenues in as compared to revenues in were reduced by a million rate decrease for the utility s new york customers that went into effect october  in connection with the current three year rate settlement approved by the nypsc 
this rate decrease was provided in the form of a bill credit included in rates during the november  through march  heating season 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this resulted from an increase in retail  off system  and transportation gas sales revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in other operating revenues of million 
the increase in retail gas revenues for the utility segment was primarily due to the recovery of higher gas costs  offset by a decrease in the volumes sold 
the recovery of higher gas costs resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the decrease in retail sales volumes was primarily the result of the migration of residential and small commercial customers to transportation service in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions  offset slightly by the impact of colder weather 
transportation revenues increased and volumes were up billion cubic feet bcf as a result of the migration noted above as well as the slightly colder weather 
off system sales revenues increased largely due to increased gas prices and slightly higher volumes 
the decrease in other operating revenues of million was largely due to million of various revenue reductions million of which was offset by lower o m expense related to the september  conclusion of the two year rate settlement approved by the nypsc 
partly offsetting these decreases was the gas restructuring reserve which reduced revenues by million in this special reserve  which did not recur in  put aside dollars to be applied against incremental costs that could result from the nypsc s gas restructuring efforts and was required in by the terms of the rate settlement with the nypsc 
the nypsc s gas restructuring efforts are further discussed in the rate matters section that follows 
earnings compared with in the utility segment  earnings were million  up million from the prior year 
items increasing earnings from the prior year include a million after tax reduction in o m expense representing the utility segment s portion of the year to year change in the company s stock appreciation right sar expense  as discussed below  and the non recurrence of million after tax of revenue adjustments recorded in related to the conclusion of the two year rate settlement  as discussed in the revenue section above 
colder weather in the utility segment s pennsylvania jurisdiction also increased earnings by million after tax  as discussed below 
furthermore  the lower provision for refund in as compared to  as discussed in the revenue section above  had a positive contribution to earnings of million after tax 
these items were offset by a million rate decrease million after tax in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction  as previously discussed 
also  the utility segment recorded an early retirement expense in its pennsylvania jurisdiction million after tax during the first quarter of and an early retirement expense in its new york jurisdiction million after tax during the second quarter of the decrease in the market price of the company s common stock during carried with it a reduction in the company s sar liability 
this reduction is spread across all segments  with the greatest impact on the pipeline and storage  utility and exploration and production segments 
for  the company experienced a reduction in its sar liability reflected through lower total company o m expense of million after tax as the market price of the company s common stock decreased from september  per common share to september  per common share 
for  the company experienced an increase in its sar liability reflected through higher total company o m expense of million after tax as the market price of the company s common stock increased from september  per common share to september  per common share 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc in new york  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall in the new york service territory  was warmer than normal for the period from october through may since the pennsylvania jurisdiction does not have a wnc  uncontrollable weather variations directly impact earnings 
in the pennsylvania service territory  weather during was colder than and colder than normal 
compared with in the utility segment  earnings were million  up million from the increase in earnings resulted primarily from two items in expenses related to an early retirement offer of million after tax and a special reserve for gas restructuring of million after tax which did not recur in 
these items were offset by an increase in the utility segment s portion of the company s sar expense  reflected through higher o m expense of million after tax  as discussed above  and revenue adjustments of million after tax  as discussed in the revenue section above 
in  the wnc in new york preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall in the new york service territory  was warmer than normal for the period from october through may since the pennsylvania rate jurisdiction does not have a wnc  uncontrollable weather variations directly impact earnings 
in the pennsylvania service territory  since weather in was only colder than  no significant earnings variances occurred 
degree days percent warmer colder than year ended september normal actual normal prior year buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is currently the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs can be attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation can satisfy a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  an increase of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was higher than the per mcf in pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation  interruptible transportation  firm storage service  interruptible storage service other  pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation  interruptible transportation  compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in compared with the increase is attributable primarily to a million increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation due to higher prices and volumes 
while transportation volumes increased bcf during the fiscal year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable sfv rate design 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the increase resulted primarily from higher firm transportation revenue of million and higher interruptible transportation and interruptible storage service revenues of million  offset by lower firm storage service revenue of million 
the increase in firm transportation revenues resulted primarily from a million pass through type item which did not recur in that reduced revenues in the prior year and correspondingly reduced o m expense in the prior year  thus having no earnings impact 
the increase in interruptible transportation and interruptible storage service revenues is principally the result of higher throughput volumes 
the decrease in firm storage service revenue was the result of discounted storage service rates  as well as the loss of certain storage service customers 
transportation volumes in this segment increased bcf 
generally  volume fluctuations do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s sfv rate design 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings for were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings for this increase in earnings is attributable to an million after tax reduction in o m expenses associated with the pipeline and storage segment s portion of the year to year change in the company s sar expense  as previously discussed 
also  there was a million after tax increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation 
the increase in earnings is also attributable to the buy out by a customer of a long term transportation contract million after tax during the first quarter of the resulting gain from this buy out was recorded in other income 
as a partial offset to these earnings increases  this segment recorded early retirement expenses of million after tax in the first and second quarters of this segment also recorded additional executive retirement benefit expenses of million after tax in compared with earnings in the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in compared with in  increased o m expenses of million after tax associated with the pipeline and storage segment s portion of the year to year change in the company s sar expense  as previously discussed  and the addition of million of new york state income tax  resulting from a change in the tax laws in new york state  contributed to the decrease in earnings 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which regulates this segment  has not provided for the recovery of additional taxes as has the new york department of public service 
several items in  which did not recur in  also contributed to earnings being less than earnings 
the earnings included interest income of million after tax and a reduction in income tax of million related to the final settlement of irs audits of years in addition  included the recovery of million after tax of costs related to a gathering project that had been previously reserved for and the recovery  through insurance  of million after tax of a previously expensed base gas loss 
these items were offset in part by a charge in for an early retirement of million after tax 
exploration and production revenues exploration and production operating revenues year ended september thousands gas after hedging  oil after hedging  gas processing plant  other  production volumes year ended september gas production mmcf gulf coast  west coast  appalachia  canada  oil production thousands of barrels mbbl gulf coast  west coast  appalachia canada  average prices year ended september average gas price mcf gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging average oil price barrel bbl gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging refer to further discussion of hedging activities below under market risk sensitive instruments and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
includes low gravity oil which generally sells for a lower price 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment increased million in compared with gas production revenue after hedging increased million due primarily to an increase in the weighted average price of gas after hedging 
overall gas production decreased  primarily in the gulf coast region  as there were delays in placing new platforms on production due to rig availability constraints and delays in work over activity  mostly during the first and second quarters of new gulf coast production in the second half of was primarily oil production 
gas production from the canadian properties acquired in june ie  the player petroleum corp 
acquisition player helped mitigate the gas production decline in the gulf coast region 
oil production revenue after hedging increased million in compared with this increase is due primarily to a increase in oil production  largely attributable to the exploration and production segment s canadian properties acquired in june revenue from this segment s gas processing plant was up million due to higher prices 
in addition  this segment recognized other revenue increases of million due to mark to market and other revenue adjustments related to derivative financial instruments 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments under the heading market risk sensitive instruments that follows 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with oil production revenues after hedging increased million as the weighted average price of oil after hedging increased and oil production increased from compared to oil production from canadian wells acquired as part of the june acquisition of tri link resources  ltd 
tri link added million to oil revenues 
gas production revenues after hedging increased million as gas production increased and the weighted average price of gas after hedging increased 
revenue from seneca s gas processing plant was up million 
these items were partly offset by a million decrease in other revenues resulting primarily from mark to market and other revenue adjustments related to written options 
earnings compared with the exploration and production segment experienced a loss of million in  a decrease of million when compared to earnings of million 
excluding the million after tax non cash impairment of this segment s canadian oil and gas assets  as previously discussed  this segment had earnings of million  an increase of million from earnings 
a increase in oil production  largely attributable to the canadian properties acquired in june  combined with higher natural gas prices  were major factors in this segment s earnings increase  exclusive of the non cash asset impairment 
also  this segment s earnings benefited from the mark to market revenue increases discussed above 
partly offsetting higher revenues was an increase in production related expenses  including higher depletion  higher purchased gas expense for the gas processing plant  an increase in lease operating costs and higher production taxes 
general and administrative expenses g a increased in total  largely due to the player and tri link acquisitions  offset by the impact of the exploration and production segment s portion of the year to year change in the company s sar expense  as previously discussed 
greater interest expense due to higher borrowings related to the player and tri link acquisitions also partially offset the positive impact of higher revenues 
compared with in the exploration and production segment  earnings of million were up million when compared with the canadian properties acquired in june added million to earnings 
as discussed above  significant improvement in oil and gas pricing  combined with an increase in production  were the main reasons for higher earnings 
partly offsetting higher revenues was an increase in production related expenses  including higher depletion  an increase in lease operating costs  and higher production taxes 
in addition  g a was up as a result of higher costs associated with labor and benefits including sar expense  and interest expense increased due to higher borrowings related to the acquisition of tri link 
the increase in the gas processing plant revenue of million was offset by an equal amount of related expense 
international revenues international operating revenues year ended september thousands heating  electricity  other  international heating and electric volumes year ended september heating sales gigajoules  electricity sales megawatt hours  gigajoules one billion joules 
a joule is a unit of energy 
compared with operating revenues decreased million in compared with the revenue decrease largely reflects a decrease in the average value of the czech koruna czk compared to the us dollar during the heating season compared to the heating season 
exclusive of the exchange rate impact  heating revenues are actually up due to rate increases offset partly by lower volumes associated with warmer weather 
electric revenues  exclusive of the exchange rate impact  decreased as a result of lower volumes principally attributable to the scheduled shutdown of a generating turbine that had reached the end of its useful life and a decline in electric rates 
compared with operating revenues decreased million in compared with the decrease in revenues is largely due to the decrease in value of the czk as compared to the us dollar 
while higher heating and electricity sales contributed to higher operating revenues in czk  the decrease in value of the czk caused an overall decrease in revenues when translated into us dollars 
earnings compared with the international segment experienced a loss of million in compared with earnings of million 
lower heat and electric margins  as a result of warmer weather and the scheduled shutdown of a generating turbine  are the primary reasons for this decrease 
the decrease also reflects a decrease in value of the czk compared to the us dollar  as previously discussed 
compared with the international segment s earnings were million  or million higher than earnings 
this increase can be attributed to lower o m expense  an income tax adjustment that benefited earnings in  and additional consideration received in on the sale of a previously written off project 
these were partly offset by a decrease in margin and the negative impact of the decline in the exchange rate  as discussed above 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging  electricity  other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf  compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the primary reason for this increase was the higher gas costs that are reflected in the natural gas marketing revenues 
higher marketing volumes are primarily due to colder weather in compared to this compensated for a decrease in nfr customers from september  to september  in addition  nfr recognized a negative million mark to market adjustment related to certain derivative financial instruments included in other on the table above during nfr experienced positive mark to market adjustments in of million 
see further discussion of nfr s use of derivatives in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the primary reason for this increase was higher gas costs that are reflected in the natural gas marketing revenues 
in addition  higher marketing volumes reflect an increase in nfr customers from  at september  to  at september  almost of the increase in customers were residential customers 
these higher revenues were offset in part by a negative million mark to market adjustment discussed above 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment incurred a loss for of million  a decrease of approximately million compared with the loss of million in the most significant reason for the lower loss was the change in mark to market adjustments from to million positive contribution after tax  referred to above 
lower margins  higher o m expense  mainly attributable to higher bad debt expense  and higher interest expense in compared to partially offset the effect of these adjustments 
compared with the energy marketing segment incurred a loss for of million  a decrease of approximately million over earnings of million 
the most significant reasons for the decrease were mark to market losses related to certain derivative financial instruments of million after tax  the accrual of a million after tax loss contingency on the unhedged portion of this segment s fixed price sales contracts for sale of natural gas to customers in  and higher expenses including interest 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales  green lumber sales  kiln dry lumber sales  other timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales  green lumber sales  kiln dry lumber sales  compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million 
green lumber sales were up due to an increase in board feet sold at slightly higher prices 
the increase in kiln dry lumber sales is due to the operation of two additional kilns brought on line in august the decrease in log sales revenues primarily reflects lower sales of quality logs offset partly by higher average prices 
compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million 
this increase was primarily the result of higher log sales and kiln dry lumber sales 
log sales were up due mainly to higher board feet of cherry veneer and export logs sold and higher average prices 
the increase in kiln dry lumber sales is due to the operation of additional kilns brought on line in that were operational for a full months in and the addition of two more kilns brought on line in august earnings compared with timber segment earnings of million in were up million compared with the increase is primarily due to higher operating revenues  as mentioned above  and lower interest expense 
compared with timber segment earnings of million in were up million compared with the increase was due to higher operating revenues  as mentioned above  and an after tax gain on the sale of land and standing timber of million 
these items were partly offset by higher interest expense resulting from higher debt related to an acquisition in july and by higher operating expenses 
other income and interest charges although most of the variances in other income items and interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  following is a summary on a consolidated basis other income other income increased million in compared with this increase resulted primarily from a million buyout of a long term transportation contract by a customer in the pipeline and storage segment during the first quarter of other income decreased million in compared with this decrease resulted from million of interest income related to the final settlement of irs audits of years which was recorded during  as well as a million gain recorded in which resulted from the demutualization of an insurance company 
as a policyholder  the company received stock of the insurance company as part of its initial public offering 
neither of these items recurred in partly offsetting this decrease was a million gain on the sale of land and standing timber in  as well as million of additional consideration received in on the sale of a previously written off project in the international segment 
interest charges interest on long term debt increased million in and million in the increase in both years can be attributed mainly to a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding 
long term debt balances have grown significantly over the past few years primarily as a result of acquisition activity in the exploration and production segment 
other interest charges decreased million in and increased million in the decrease in was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates on short term debt 
the increase in resulted primarily from higher weighted average interest rates and higher average amounts of short term debt outstanding 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures investment in subsidiaries  net of cash acquired investment in partnerships other investing activities short term debt  net change long term debt  net change issuance of common stock dividends paid on common stock dividends paid to minority interest effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for noncash expenses  noncash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes  minority interest in foreign subsidiaries and the impairment of oil and gas producing properties 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s sfv rate design 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the increase is attributable primarily to higher cash receipts from the sale of oil and gas in the exploration and production segment 
gas prices were up significantly for most of and oil production increased significantly due to this segment s canadian properties acquired in june  offsetting a slight overall decrease in oil prices 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities also reflects the over recovery of purchased gas costs in the utility segment during investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets expenditures for long lived assets include additions to property  plant and equipment capital expenditures and investments in corporations stock acquisitions or partnerships  net of any cash acquired 
the company s expenditures for long lived assets totaled million in the table below presents these expenditures total investments expenditures capital in corporations for long year ended september  millions expenditures or partnerships lived assets utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international energy marketing timber all other utility the majority of the utility capital expenditures were made for replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines 
pipeline and storage the pipeline and storage segment s capital expenditures made during included million for the construction of a transmission line from lamont  pennsylvania to roystone  pennsylvania 
the remaining capital expenditures were made for additions  improvements and replacements to this segment s transmission and gas storage systems 
during  sip made an additional  investment in independence 
sip s total investment through september  was million 
the investment represents a one third partnership interest in independence 
the investment has been financed with short term borrowings 
independence intends to build the independence pipeline  a mile natural gas pipeline from defiance  ohio to leidy  pennsylvania at an estimated cost of about million 
if the independence pipeline project is not constructed  sip s share of the developmental costs including sip s investment in independence is estimated not to exceed million 
this amount represents the estimated maximum charge to earnings that would be recorded if the project is not constructed 
on july   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity the certificate authorizing  among other things  the construction and operation of the independence pipeline  subject to satisfaction of various conditions spelled out in the certificate and in previous ferc orders 
independence accepted the certificate on august  among the conditions to the construction and operation of the pipeline is the requirement that the pipeline be in service by july  another condition is that  before construction may commence  independence must file at ferc executed  firm transportation agreements with no out clauses for at least of its capacity 
independence already filed  on june and july   precedent agreements for firm transportation amounting to about of the capacity of the independence pipeline  thereby satisfying a ferc requirement previously imposed as a precondition to ferc s issuance of the certificate 
the independence pipeline partners are working on obtaining the required additional customer commitments  and had extended the planned in service date from november  to july  to allow additional time to obtain those commitments 
the certificate also includes an environmental condition that independence file an implementation plan within days after independence accepts the certificate 
ferc extended the due date for submission of that implementation plan to november  on november   independence filed a partial implementation plan with ferc seeking to extend the due date for a complete implementation plan to november and to extend the in service date to november as of the date the company filed this form k with the sec  ferc had placed the independence pipeline project on the agenda for its december  meeting but had not decided upon independence s requests for extensions 
if ferc does not grant these extensions  it may revoke the certificate 
if the certificate is revoked and the independence partners decide to proceed with the project  they would file a new application at ferc after obtaining additional customer commitments 
the company also continues to explore various opportunities to participate in transporting gas to the northeast  either through supply s system or in partnership with others 
this includes the proposed northwinds pipeline that the company and transcanada pipelines limited are pursuing 
this project would be a mile  inch natural gas pipeline that would originate in kirkwall  ontario  cross into the united states near buffalo  new york and follow a southerly route to its destination in the ellisburg leidy area in pennsylvania 
the initial capacity of the pipeline would be approximately million cubic feet of natural gas per day with the estimated cost of the pipeline ranging from million 
at september   the company had not incurred any material costs associated with this project 
the company would be interested in building the independence pipeline and or the northwinds pipeline if there are sufficient customer commitments 
exploration and production the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures included approximately million of capital expenditures for on shore drilling  construction and recompletion costs for wells located in louisiana  texas  california and canada as well as on shore geological and geophysical costs  including the purchase of certain three dimensional seismic data and fixed asset purchases 
of the million discussed above  million was spent on the exploration and production segment s canadian properties 
the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures also included approximately million for seneca s offshore program in the gulf of mexico  including offshore drilling expenditures  offshore construction  lease acquisition costs and geological and geophysical expenditures 
in june  the company acquired the issued and outstanding shares of player  an oil and gas exploration and development company with operations based primarily in the province of alberta  canada 
the cost of acquiring the shares of player was approximately million 
the acquisition was financed with short term borrowings 
international the majority of the international segment s capital expenditures were concentrated on the construction of boilers at a district heating and power generation plant in the czech republic 
in june  the company sold its ownership interest in jabloneck tepl rensk a realitn  as jtr 
jtr is a district heating plant in the northern part of the czech republic 
the proceeds from this sale  net of cash sold  were million 
there was a loss of less than million on the sale 
timber the majority of the timber segment s capital expenditures were made for purchases of land and timber  as well as equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
in november  this segment sold timber properties with a book value of million for million 
in april  this segment sold land having a minimal book value for million 
all other expenditures for long lived assets for all other subsidiaries consisted of the purchase of a partnership interest in model city energy  llc model city million and the purchase of a partnership interest in energy systems north east  llc esne million 
the company also financed esne with a long term note in the principal amount of million 
model city generates electricity by using methane gas obtained from a landfill in model city  new york  which is owned by an outside party 
esne is an megawatt power plant located in north east  pennsylvania 
the plant provides thermal energy to an adjacent  industrial facility  as well as electric power to the new york power pool 
estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international timber estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells and the replacement of storage and transmission lines 
the estimated capital expenditures also include million for an increase in horsepower at the ellisburg  pennsylvania compressor station 
the estimated capital expenditures do not include any partnership investments for independence or the northwinds pipeline 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the onshore program million in canada 
of this amount  approximately million million in canada is intended to be spent on exploratory and development drilling 
the estimated expenditures also include approximately million for the offshore program in the gulf of mexico 
of this amount  approximately million is intended to be spent on exploratory and development drilling 
the estimated capital expenditures for the international segment in will be concentrated on improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
estimated capital expenditures in the timber segment will be concentrated on the purchase of land and timber as well as the construction or purchase of new facilities and equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations and partnerships 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or storage facilities and the expansion of transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow in november  the company issued million of medium term notes due in november after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company amounted to million 
the proceeds of this debt issuance were used to reduce short term debt 
consolidated short term debt decreased million during the company continues to consider short term debt an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  exploration and development expenditures and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at projected market interest rates 
excluding the unrealized gain for derivative financial instruments reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet  the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at projected market interest rates 
in addition  at september   the company had regulatory authorizations and unused short term credit lines that would have permitted it to borrow an additional million of short term debt 
the company s embedded cost of long term debt was at both september  and  respectively

as indicated in the tables above  the company has significantly reduced its use of natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements  which is primarily attributable to the pricing environment during the latter part of compared to in the latter part of  prices were on the rise  allowing the company to lock in favorable prices 
in the latter part of  prices were falling providing less opportunities for the company to lock in favorable prices 
furthermore  the company has changed its hedging strategy by using more natural gas no cost collars and options puts to allow the company to share in more of the upside potential of commodity prices while limiting the downside risk 
the following tables disclose the notional quantities  the weighted average ceiling price and the weighted average floor price for the no cost collars used by the company to manage natural gas and crude oil price risk 
the no cost collars provide for the company to receive monthly payments from or make payments to other parties when a variable price falls below an established floor price the company receives payment from the counterparty or exceeds an established ceiling price the company pays the counterparty

the company had also sold natural gas options covering bcf at a weighted average strike price of per mcf and sold crude oil options covering  bbls at a weighted average strike price of per bbl 
the significant decrease in the amount of options outstanding at september  compared to september  primarily reflects a change in hedging strategy by the company s energy marketing segment  which eliminated its use of options in at september   the energy marketing segment was using only futures contracts to manage the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
the options outstanding at september  were purchased by the company s exploration and production segment

to mitigate such credit risk  management performs a credit check and then  on an ongoing basis  monitors counterparty credit exposure 
management has obtained guarantees from the parent companies of the respective counterparties to its derivative financial instruments 
at september   the company s credit risk amounted to million of net fair value that was owed to the company for its price swap agreements  no cost collars and puts 
there are five counterparties that comprise this credit risk  with the minimum and maximum credit risk from any of the counterparties being and  respectively  of the total fair value at september  one of the counterparties  enron  representing of the total fair value at september   filed for bankruptcy protection subsequent to september  the bankruptcy filing effectively terminated the natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements as well as the crude oil no cost collars that the company had entered into with enron

at september  compared to september   the canadian dollar was lower in value in relation to the us dollar  resulting in a million negative adjustment to the cta 
further valuation changes to the czech koruna and canadian dollar would result in corresponding positive or negative adjustments to the cta 
management cannot predict whether the czech koruna or canadian dollar will increase or decrease in value against the us dollar 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk primarily consists of short term debt instruments 
at september   these instruments included short term bank loans and commercial paper totaling million domestically 
the interest rate on these short term bank loans and commercial paper approximated at september  the company s short term debt instruments also included million of short term bank loans in canada and the czech republic at september  the weighted average interest rates on the canadian and czech republic loans approximated and  respectively  at september  the following table presents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term fixed rate debt as well as the other long term debt of certain of the company s subsidiaries

the company utilizes an interest rate swap to eliminate interest rate fluctuations on its czk  term loan million at september   which carries a variable interest rate of six month prague interbank offered rate pribor plus 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  which extends until  the company pays a fixed rate of and receives a floating rate of six month pribor 
the company would have paid approximately million to settle the interest rate swap at september  rate matters utility operation new york jurisdiction on october   the nypsc approved a settlement agreement agreement between distribution corporation  staff of the department of public service  the new york state consumer protection board and multiple intervenors an advocate for large commercial and industrial customers that establishes rates for a three year period beginning october  the agreement provides that customers will receive a bill credit of million in the first year  of which million relates to customers share of earnings accumulated under previous settlements 
the credit will be reduced to million in the second year  and in the third and subsequent years the credit will remain at million unless the company can demonstrate that it is no longer justified 
also  earnings beyond a target level of return on equity will be shared equally between shareholders and ratepayers 
the agreement provides further that the company and interested parties will resume discussions to address the nypsc s competition initiatives  including changes to customer choice transportation services  among other things 
those discussions commenced in november and ultimately produced an interim joint proposal  or settlement agreement  addressing several discrete issues of interest to the parties and the nypsc 
in an order issued on may   the nypsc adopted the parties joint proposal 
as recommended by the parties  the joint proposal modifies distribution corporation s operations relating to transportation services and transactions with marketers and producers of indigenous natural gas 
under the joint proposal  the parties also agreed to continue negotiations to implement additional features of the nypsc s restructuring initiative described below 
those confidential discussions  dubbed phase iii negotiations  are continuing 
the joint proposal makes no changes in distribution corporation s revenue requirement or other such matters addressed in the above described settlement agreement 
on november   the nypsc issued its policy statement concerning the future of the natural gas industry in new york state and order terminating capacity assignment policy statement 
the policy statement sets forth the nypsc s vision on how best to ensure a competitive market for natural gas in new york 
the policy statement  which sets forth numerous achievement goals  has been regarded as the commission s template for restructuring of the gas industry 
the policy statement provides that the most effective way to establish a competitive market in gas supply is for local distribution companies to cease selling gas 
the nypsc indicated in its order that it hopes to accomplish that objective over a three to seven year transition period from the date the policy statement was issued  taking into account statutory requirements and the individual needs of each local distribution company ldc 
the policy statement directs staff to schedule discussions with each ldc on an individualized plan that would effectuate our vision 
in preparation for negotiations  ldcs will be required to address issues such as a strategy to hold new capacity contracts to a minimum  a long term rate plan with a goal of reducing or freezing rates  and a plan for further unbundling 
in addition  staff was instructed to hold collaborative sessions with multiple parties to discuss generic issues including reliability and market power regulation 
distribution corporation has participated in the collaborative sessions 
these collaborative sessions have not yet produced a consensus document on all issues before the nypsc 
distribution corporation will continue to participate in all future collaborative sessions 
as an outgrowth of the policy statement  the nypsc issued an order directing expedited consideration of rate unbundling on march  unbundling order 
the unbundling order directs the state s electric and gas utilities  including distribution corporation  to submit cost studies for bottom up unbundling  which as described by the nypsc  begins with the total costs of the utility s business and then assigns those costs to the various functions  some of which are expected to become competitively available 
this is in contrast to methods used for establishing back out credits  although the result is essentially the same competitive functions are identified and priced in order to subsidize market entry for marketers 
numerous parties met for several collaborative sessions and were unable to reach consensus on the methodology for the studies 
accordingly  briefs were filed and a decision on the appropriate methodology to use will be issued by the nypsc at a later date 
distribution corporation has no objection to the nypsc s authority to order unbundling cost studies  but to the extent any legally mandated utility functions are identified as competitive  there is a possibility that stranded costs may be incurred 
while at this juncture the nypsc has not indicated that stranded cost recovery would be denied  in whole or in part  the issue remains open for consideration in individual utility proceedings 
at this time  distribution corporation is unable to ascertain the outcome of this proceeding 
on july   the nypsc ordered implementation of an initial set of electronic data interchange edi datasets for electronic exchange of retail access data in new york edi order 
as described by the nypsc  edi is the computer to computer exchange of routine business information in a standard form 
the nypsc believes that edi is necessary to develop uniform data exchange protocol for the state s customer choice initiatives 
the edi order adopts modified enrollment and historical usage datasets initially prepared by an edi working group involving utilities  marketers and other interests 
the order identifies required changes to uniform business practices and also adopts web site design principles and edi testing plans 
initial edi implementation is ordered for calendar year end following completion of edi testing 
phased testing of edi began during the fourth quarter of calendar the nypsc also directs development of datasets governing billing and payment processing based upon the recommendations of a national group of stakeholders 
edi datasets governing billing are now under development and will be completed in the first quarter of calendar and implemented thereafter 
the nypsc continues to address  through various proceedings and collaboratives  upstream pipeline capacity issues arising from the restructuring 
currently distribution corporation remains authorized to release upstream intermediate capacity to marketers serving former sales customers 
costs relating to retained upstream transmission capacity are recovered through a transition cost surcharge 
at this time  distribution corporation does not foresee any material changes to upstream capacity requirements in the near term 
on may   the new york state tax law was amended to phase out the long running tax on utility gross revenues beginning january  offsetting the scheduled reductions  however  is the imposition of a net income based tax on the same utilities 
in an order issued on december   the nypsc adopted a recommendation providing that utilities be kept whole for any tax increases resulting from implementation of the changes 
toward that end  the report proposed that the mechanism in rates currently used for recovery of the gross revenue tax would be utilized to collect the new income tax 
to the extent a utility s income tax liability exceeded the amount collectible through the existing gross revenue tax recovery mechanism  deferral accounting would be authorized 
pennsylvania jurisdiction distribution corporation currently does not have a rate case on file with the pennsylvania public utility commission papuc 
management will continue to monitor its financial position in the pennsylvania jurisdiction to determine the necessity of filing a rate case in the future 
a natural gas restructuring bill was signed into law on june  entitled the natural gas choice and competition act act  the new law requires all pennsylvania ldcs to file tariffs designed to provide retail customers with direct access to competitive gas markets 
distribution corporation submitted its compliance filing on october  for an effective date on or about july  the filing largely mirrored distribution corporation s system wide energy select program previously in effect  which substantially complied with the act s requirements 
after negotiations with papuc staff and intervenors  a settlement was reached with all parties except for the pennsylvania office of consumer advocate oca 
the settlement parties generally agreed that distribution corporation s proposal needed only modest changes to meet the requirements of the act 
hearings were held and briefs filed on oca s open issues 
in a recommended decision issued on march   the administrative law judge rejected the oca s arguments and recommended approval of the settlement agreement 
on june   the papuc entered an opinion and order adopting the settlement  with immaterial changes 
distribution corporation s restructured rates and services became effective on july  base rate adjustments in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
such costs are recovered through operation of the purchased gas adjustment clauses of the appropriate regulatory authorities 
pipeline and storage supply corporation currently does not have a rate case on file with the ferc 
management will continue to monitor supply corporation s financial position to determine the necessity of filing a rate case in the future
