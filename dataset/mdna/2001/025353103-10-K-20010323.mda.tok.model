item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview american dental partners  inc is a leading provider of business services to multi disciplinary dental groups in selected markets throughout the united states 
we were formed in december  commenced operations in january and began providing business services to dental groups in november  concurrent with the completion of our first dental group affiliation 
our rapid growth has resulted primarily from our affiliations with dental groups 
from november to december   we completed affiliation transactions  comprising dental groups  and at december   we operated dental facilities with  operatories in states 
affiliation summary when affiliating with a dental group  we acquire substantially all its assets except those required by law to be owned or maintained by dentists such as third party contracts  certain governmental receivables and patient records and enter into a long term service agreement with the affiliated dental group or professional corporation pc 
under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the pc is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 
during  and  we acquired substantially all the assets of ten  twelve and nine dental practices  respectively  and simultaneously entered into year service agreements with twelve of the affiliated dental groups practices joined existing affiliates 
in total  these affiliations resulted in the addition of dental facilities and operatories 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on acquisitions and affiliations 
we currently are in discussions with a number of dentists and owners of dental groups about possible affiliations with us 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will consummate any of these possible affiliations 
affiliate adjusted gross revenue compared to net revenue affiliate adjusted gross revenue and payor mix we do not own or control the affiliated dental groups and  accordingly  do not consolidate the financial statements of the pcs with ours 
our affiliated dental groups generate revenue from patients and dental benefit providers under fee for service  ppo plans and capitated managed care plans 
the affiliated dental groups record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at adjusted gross revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the aggregate payor mix percentage of our affiliated groups for the year ended december  was approximately fee for service  ppo plans and capitated managed care plans 
the pcs reimburse us for expenses incurred on their behalf in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to us for business services 
expenses incurred for the operation and administration of the dental facilities include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental hygienists and dental assistants  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses 
see business operations operating structure 
the pcs are responsible for the salaries  benefits and other expenses of the dentists 
in addition  in certain states where the pcs must employ dental hygienists and dental assistants  the pcs are responsible for salaries  benefits and other expenses of such non dentist employees 
since  we have entered into affiliation transactions with a number of dental practices located in states where dental hygienists and dental assistants are required to be employed by the pcs 
in recent years  due to the increasing demand for dental services relative to a decreasing supply of dentists nationally  dentist compensation has been increasing generally and for our affiliated dental groups specifically  and we expect this trend to continue 
as a result of these two factors  the percentage of affiliate adjusted gross revenue retained by the pcs has increased from of adjusted gross revenue in to in and in consequently  it is helpful to analyze operating trends as a percentage of affiliate adjusted gross revenue as well as a percentage of our net revenue 
net revenue our net revenue represents primarily reimbursement of expenses and fees charged to the affiliated dental groups pursuant to the terms of the long term service agreements under which we agree to provide business services 
under such agreements  the affiliated dental groups reimburse us for actual expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to us for our business services 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists of a variable monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the pc s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities 
under certain service agreements  our service fees consist of a fixed monthly fee and an additional variable fee 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee 
the fixed monthly fees are determined by agreement of us and the affiliated dental group in a formal budgeting process 
additionally  our net revenue includes amounts from dental benefit providers related to the arrangement of the provision of care to patients 
for additional information on affiliate adjusted gross revenue and components of our net revenue  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenue net revenue increased in to  and in to  the increases in net revenue are due to same market growth from dental groups which were our affiliates during the entirety of both the current years and the previous years and the inclusion of revenue derived from service agreements entered into in connection with affiliation transactions in the current years and from a full year impact of affiliation transactions in the previous years 
same market growth of in and in resulted from the addition and expansion of our facilities  successful renegotiation of certain dental benefit provider contracts which increased the level of reimbursement for services provided by our affiliated dental groups and the addition of dentists to our affiliated dental groups 
during the fourth quarter of  several of our affiliated dental groups were impacted by severe winter storms and one affiliate was impacted by a tornado 
this weather occurred primarily in december and  as a result  our affiliated dental groups were unable to reschedule lost production in because of full patient schedules during the balance of the year 
we estimate that these winter storms and the tornado reduced our net revenue and net earnings by approximately  salaries and benefits expense salaries and benefits expense includes costs for personnel working for us at the dental facilities as well as local and regional management 
at the facility level  we generally employ the administrative staff and  where permitted by state law  the dental hygienists and dental assistants 
the local and regional operating management teams supervise and support the staff at the dental facilities 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in to in as a result of increased business in states where the pc s are required to employ the dental hygienists and dental assistants  more efficient utilization of staff in existing facilities and leveraging of local and regional management and administrative resources in certain markets 
these costs savings were partially offset by the affiliation with practices with a generally higher ratio of staffing costs to net revenue in their respective markets compared to the existing base of affiliates and wage inflation due to tight labor markets 
we anticipate such wage inflation pressures will continue for the foreseeable future 
lab fees and dental supplies expense lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
the increase in lab fees and dental supplies expense as a percentage of net revenue from in to in is due almost entirely to the affiliation with practices with a generally higher ratio of lab fees and dental supplies expense to net revenue in their respective markets compared to the existing base of affiliates 
we experienced rate increases in from certain lab providers and dental supply manufacturers 
this price inflation  however  was offset entirely by the successful negotiation of a national contract for the purchase of dental supplies  effectively taking advantage of economies of scale and certain manufacturer rebate programs 
the increase in lab fees and dental supplies expense from in to in was primarily due to price increases from certain lab providers due to increases in costs of certain precious metals and their internal wage inflation 
in addition  the affiliation with practices with a generally higher ratio of lab fees and dental supplies expense to net revenue compared to the existing base of affiliates further increased this expense category as a percentage of net revenue 
in  we continued to offset dental supply manufacturer price increases with the economies of scale realized through our national dental supply purchasing and rebate programs 
we believe such price inflation will continue for the foreseeable future 
while the lab fees and dental supplies expense has increased  the trend is less significant when calculated as a percentage of affiliate adjusted gross revenue 
office occupancy expense office occupancy expense includes rent expense and certain other operating costs such as utilities associated with dental facilities and the local administrative offices 
such costs vary based on the size of each facility and the market rental rate for dental office space in the particular geographic market 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of net revenue increased from in to in and in primarily as a result of the investment in the relocation and addition of new dental facilities 
in and  we added new facilities in arizona  california  minnesota and virginia and relocated and expanded facilities in arizona  minnesota  texas and wisconsin 
in  we added a new facility in north carolina and relocated and expanded facilities in california  maryland  minnesota  pennsylvania  texas and wisconsin 
this investment in facilities increased our physical capacity in these markets to allow for future growth 
initially  however  the increase in office occupancy expense was not fully offset by incremental net revenue 
in addition  during  we invested in regional administrative offices in arizona  pennsylvania and virginia in order to accommodate the regionalization of management and administrative support in certain markets 
further increasing office occupancy expense as a percentage of net revenue in was the affiliation with practices with a generally higher ratio of office occupancy expense to net revenue in their respective markets compared to the existing base of affiliates 
these increased costs were partially offset by better utilization of capacity in existing facilities in and and the leveraging of local and regional management office occupancy expense in certain markets in we expect office occupancy expense to continue to increase as we invest in the relocation and expansion of dental facilities 
these increases should be partially or fully offset by better utilization of capacity in existing dental facilities 
while office occupancy expense has increased  the trend is less significant when calculated as a percentage of affiliate adjusted gross revenue 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue from in to in to in primarily as a result of economies of scale as it relates to professional fees and insurance expense  the regionalization of administrative and data processing functions in certain markets  the dilution of the impact of the minnesota care tax and better management of certain discretionary spending 
these costs savings were partially offset by the affiliation with practices with a generally higher ratio of other operating expenses to net revenue in their respective markets compared to the existing base of affiliates 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses consist of compensation expenses for our corporate personnel and administrative staff  as well as facility and other administrative costs of our corporate office 
general corporate expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue from in to in to in throughout and  we continued to expand our management infrastructure in the areas of finance  operations  employee benefit administration and professional recruiting 
despite these additions  we continue to leverage these costs 
the level of general corporate expenses may continue to increase in the future as we continue to expand our management infrastructure 
however  it is anticipated that these costs will decline as a percentage of net revenue in the future 
depreciation depreciation expense includes depreciation charges related to leasehold improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment used to operate the dental facilities  local and regional management offices and our corporate office 
depreciation expense increased as a percentage of net revenue from in to in to in primarily due to the depreciation of assets acquired and capital expenditures associated with the investment in the relocation and addition of new dental facilities in certain markets 
in and  we added new facilities in arizona  california  minnesota and virginia and relocated and expanded facilities in arizona  minnesota  texas and wisconsin 
in  we added a new facility in north carolina and relocated and expanded facilities in california  maryland  minnesota  pennsylvania  texas and wisconsin 
these capital expenditures increased our capacity to allow for future growth 
this increase in depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenue was partially offset by leveraging the costs in existing facilities 
we expect to continue to invest in the relocation and expansion of our physical capacity  although at a lower amount than historical levels 
accordingly  depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation could increase 
while depreciation expense has increased as a percentage of net revenue  it has remained unchanged as a percentage of affiliate adjusted gross revenue 
amortization of intangible assets amortization increased as a percentage of net revenue from in to in to in primarily as a result of intangible assets recorded in connection with the affiliation transactions completed since amortization of intangible assets could increase in the future as a result of intangibles recorded in connection with future acquisitions and affiliations  although we expect to complete fewer affiliations than we historically have 
while amortization of intangible assets has increased as a percentage of net revenue  it has remained relatively unchanged as a percentage of affiliate adjusted gross revenue 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased in and primarily as a result of increased average borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the affiliation transactions completed since mid and a portion of our capital expenditures throughout and in addition  the issuance of subordinated notes in connection with the affiliation transactions since contributed to higher interest expense in and average borrowings in were significantly lower than in due in large part to using a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility in the second quarter of the increase in interest expense in was partially reduced due to an overall lower average market interest rate under our revolving credit facility in than in in addition  a higher overall average market interest rate in and increased financing costs associated with amending our revolving credit facility in july further increased interest expense from to although interest expense will likely increase in the near future due to a higher average level of indebtedness  we believe interest expense may not increase in to the extent it did in due to lower anticipated overall average market interest rates and a reduced level of affiliation transactions and capital expenditures 
income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was impacted by the reversal of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets established in and see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate in decreased from the normalized effective tax rate due primarily to a reduction in the proportionate amount of amortization of intangible assets which are not deductible for tax purposes  partially offset by a higher federal statutory rate resulting from increased pre tax income in and an increase in the proportionate amount of income in states with higher average tax rates 
the effective tax rate in decreased primarily due to an increase in the proportionate amount of income in states with lower average tax rates 
this reduction was partially offset by a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and other permanent differences 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  from sales of equity securities  borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash generated from operations 
from january  through december   we completed dental practice affiliations for aggregate consideration of million in cash  million in subordinated promissory notes  million in deferred payments and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the increase in cash from operations resulted primarily from an increase in cash from operations due to incremental earnings generated from affiliations and same market growth 
this was partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash paid for income taxes and interest in compared to cash from operations was further offset by an increase in receivables due from affiliated dental groups 
the increase in our affiliate receivable balance is a direct result of our affiliated dental groups shifting their payor mix away from prospective pay capitation revenue and toward higher margin claims based reimbursement plans 
this shift resulted in an increase in working capital of our affiliated dental groups and  consequently  an increase in our receivables due from affiliated dental groups 
for the years ended december  and  cash used in investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities included cash used for affiliations and for capital expenditures 
cash used for affiliations  net of cash acquired  was  and  for and  respectively 
cash used for capital expenditures was  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with the addition of a new dental facility in each of arizona  california and virginia  four new dental facilities in minnesota and the relocation and or expansion of dental facilities in arizona  minnesota  texas and wisconsin 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with the addition of a new dental facility in north carolina and the relocation and or expansion of dental facilities in california  maryland  minnesota  pennsylvania  texas and wisconsin 
the construction of new dental facilities and the refurbishment  expansion or relocation of existing dental facilities in the future will require ongoing capital expenditures 
although we expect to continue to make meaningful capital expenditures  we do not expect capital expenditures in to continue at the same levels as and for the years ended december  and  cash provided by financing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in resulted from net borrowings under our revolving line of credit of  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the employee stock purchase plan of  offset by the repayment of certain indebtedness of  and the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for  cash provided by financing activities in resulted from net borrowings under our revolving line of credit of  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the employee stock purchase plan of  offset by the repayment of indebtedness of  payment of debt issuance costs of  and the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for  in july  we amended our existing revolving line of credit  increasing the total available amount from million to million 
the credit facility is being used for general corporate purposes including affiliations and capital expenditures 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at either prime or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin is based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranges from to for prime loans and to for libor loans 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee which ranges from to of the average daily balance of the unused line 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on adjusted ebitda 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
we are also required to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
the line of credit matures in july the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission registration no 
covering a total of  shares of common stock and  aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to be issued in connection with future dental practice affiliations 
as of december    shares and  of notes remain available for issuance under this shelf registration statement 
our growth to date has resulted in large measure from our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
although we have affiliated with many dental practices since our initial affiliation in november  there can be no assurance that additional affiliation candidates can be identified  consummated or successfully integrated into our operations 
we have used a combination of cash  common stock and subordinated debt as consideration for past acquisitions and affiliations and plan to continue to use these sources in the future 
in the past two years  the consideration paid has consisted of a higher percentage of cash and subordinated debt and a lower percentage of common stock 
in addition  we currently are in discussions with a number of dentists and owners of dental groups about possible affiliations with us 
while we continue to evaluate new affiliation opportunities  we intend to focus more on internal operations and  therefore  potentially reduce indebtedness over the next twelve months 
as a result  it is expected that the number of new affiliations over the next twelve months will be somewhat lower relative to previous years 
furthermore  we continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase our common stock through our previously announced repurchase program  pursuant to which approximately million remains available to repurchase additional shares 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  affiliations and common stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
subsequent event in january  three of our affiliated dental groups  park dental  associated dental care providers and university dental associates  received notices of contract termination from cigna dental and associated dental care providers received notice of contract termination from protective life corporation 
the four contracts represented approximately million of affiliate adjusted gross revenue in the effective dates of termination for these four contracts are i july  for park dental  ii march  for university dental associates and iii march  cigna dental and april  protective life for associated dental care providers 
these affiliates subsequently received proposed terms for new provider contracts from cigna dental 
the affiliates found the proposed terms unacceptable  and we are working with them in evaluating their options in light of the termination notices 
in evaluating options  we and our affiliates believe that the financial impact of not continuing as a provider with both dental benefit plan providers  while difficult to ascertain precisely  would be less severe than accepting the proposed provider relationships 
while the exact outcome cannot be determined at this time  we believe the disruption being caused by the termination notices may impact net earnings for the first and second quarters of by to per share per quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in money market instruments 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate or market risk 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins  ranging from to for prime loans and to for libor loans  based upon our debt coverage ratio 
as a result of amending our revolving credit facility in july  the banks margin increased by from historical levels 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum 
we do not presently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
