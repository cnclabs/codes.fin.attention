established in and based in lexington  massachusetts  photoelectron has focused its development efforts on miniature x ray technology 
the company is leveraging its miniature x ray technology expertise into distinct markets including cancer treatment  intravascular radiation therapy  industrial x ray  and radiation dosimetry 
regulatory approval and broad distribution channels for the company s current products have been secured  to allow for international marketing and sales 
to date  the company has not received any significant revenue from the sale of its products 
the company has experienced significant operating losses in each year since its inception  due primarily to substantial research and development expenditures 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and expects to continue to incur losses until such time as its commercialization efforts yield offsetting revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will ever gain commercial acceptance  or that the company will ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
the company s ability to achieve profitable operations will be dependent in a large part on whether it can successfully commercialize its products and make the transition to a manufacturing and marketing company

in july  the fda approved the company s application for market clearance under section k of the fdc act for intracranial treatment of tumors with the prs system 
in september  the company received section k market clearance to use the prs system for the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body 
during  the prs system was integrated into a new treatment system designed to address an expanding range of clinical applications 
this new product  known as the intrabeam  has been developed in collaboration with carl zeiss for cancer treatment products 
the intrabeam combines the prs system miniature x ray source with a counterbalanced surgical support stand  and is used for the delivery of iort treatment of any body site 
in august  the company entered into a strategic relationship with carl zeiss  an international technology leader whose medical systems division specializes in high technology equipment such as surgical microscopes for various medical disciplines and state of the art image guided surgery equipment 
the company appointed carl zeiss as its exclusive distributor for the prs throughout the world except for japan where toshiba is the company s distributor of the prs for intracranial applications and spinal radiotherapy and as its non exclusive distributor for the prs in the same territory for all other clinical applications 
in addition  carl zeiss agreed to assist the company in the development of new intraoperative radiotherapy products and to provide service and support for the company s products 
the alliance with carl zeiss gives the company access to a global sales force with an established record of sales of high technology equipment within the medical field 
after completing the development of the prs system  the company s focus turned toward the development of tools and mechanisms to expand the established range of clinical applications

 became effective on september  in july  the company produced a working prototype of a new system for delivering x rays from inside blood vessels following an operation for clogged arteries x seed tm 
the x seed x ray source uses a combination of lasers and high voltages to produce x rays  a concept based on the company s patented technology 
the new miniature system is completely self contained and its key components are less than millimeter in diameter 
once development of this product is completed  it is intended that a clinical version of the system could be placed inside blood vessels to deliver a dose of radiation to the interior surface  sufficient to prevent restenosis after angioplasty or a stent procedure 
this product is currently being developed for commercialization and is not anticipated to be approved for sale in the near term 
in september  pyc corporation  the company s largest stockholder  exercised a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share for a total of  the warrant was originally issued in conjunction with a subordinated debt financing 
in october  the company produced a working prototype of a new miniature x ray source for industrial x ray fluorescence measurements laser x tm 
the laser x is designed to be incorporated into equipment used for non destructive materials testing and to replace the radioactive sources that are currently used to provide radiation for fluorescence analysis 
the external diameter of the new miniature x ray tube is approximately millimeters 
orders for the new miniature x ray source for x ray fluorescence have been received from two suppliers of portable x ray fluorescence units with scheduled delivery dates through july in november  the company and toshiba submitted to the japan ministry of health an application for product approval of the prs system 
toshiba is helping to develop and support clinical trials of the prs system in japan pursuant to an agreement between the company and toshiba entered into on december  the development and support of the clinical trials included purchasing two complete systems of the prs system for use in the clinical trials  installing and maintaining the prs system  and providing assistance to the physicians and hospitals conducting the trials  including collection and analysis of clinical data
