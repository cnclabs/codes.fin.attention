the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under item business investment considerations 
overview on july   we entered into a management agreement with sprint pcs whereby we became the sprint pcs network partner with the right to provide digital  pcs services under the sprint and sprint pcs brand names in our sprint pcs territory in the southeastern united states 
we completed our radio frequency design  network design and substantial site acquisition and cell site engineering  and commenced construction of our pcs network in november in january  we began commercial operations with the launch of four markets covering million residents in our sprint pcs territory 
by september   we had launched commercial pcs service in all of the markets that comprise our sprint pcs territory 
at september   we provided sprint pcs services to  subscribers 
sprint pcs has invested million to purchase the pcs licenses in our territory and incurred additional expenses for microwave clearing 
under our long term agreements with sprint pcs  we manage the network on sprint pcs licensed spectrum as well as use the sprint and sprint pcs brand names royalty free during our affiliation with sprint pcs 
we also have access to sprint pcs national marketing support and distribution programs and are entitled to buy network and subscriber equipment and handsets at the same discounted rates offered by vendors to sprint pcs based on its large volume purchases 
in exchange for these and other benefits  we are entitled to receive  and sprint pcs is entitled to retain  of collected service revenues from customers in our sprint pcs territory 
we are entitled to of revenues collected from the sale of handsets and accessories and on roaming revenues received when sprint pcs customers from a different territory make a wireless call on our sprint pcs network 
through september   we have incurred million of capital expenditures related to the build out of our sprint pcs network 
at september   our sprint pcs network covered million of the million residents in our sprint pcs territory based on estimates compiled by kagan s wireless telecom atlas databook  edition 
results of operations for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  customer additions as of september   we provided personal communication services to  customers compared to  customers as of september   an increase of  customers 
we do not include in our financial statements an estimate of revenues or subscribers related to those customers for which collection of revenues is not reasonably assured 
the increased net customers acquired during the year ended september  are attributable to having all of our markets fully launched during fiscal and increasing demand for wireless services in the united states 
average revenue per user arpu an important operating metric in the wireless industry is average revenue per user arpu 
arpu summarizes the average monthly service revenue per customer 
arpu is computed by dividing service revenue by the average subscribers for the period computed based upon monthly subscriber counts 
we previously reported arpu net of an adjustment for the provision for doubtful accounts 
as of september   we began reporting arpu gross of the provision for doubtful accounts  to be consistent with current industry practices 
for the year ended september   arpu was for the year ended september   arpu was the increase in arpu primarily resulted from customers selecting rate plans with higher monthly recurring charges 
revenues service revenue and equipment revenue were million and million  respectively  for the year ended september   compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended september   an increase of million and million  respectively 
these increased revenues reflect that all of our markets were commercially operational in fiscal whereas fiscal reflected a launch year for our markets 
service revenue consists of monthly recurring access and feature charges and monthly non recurring charges for local  long distance and roaming airtime usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan 
equipment revenue is derived from the sale of handsets and accessories from our sprint pcs stores  net of an allowance for returns 
our handset return policy allows customers to return their handsets for a full refund within days of purchase 
when handsets are returned to us  we may be able to reissue the handsets to customers at little additional cost to us 
however  when handsets are returned to sprint pcs for refurbishing  we receive a credit from sprint pcs  which is less than the amount we originally paid for the handset 
we recorded roaming revenue of million during the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of million 
the increase is attributable to the completion of the network build out and a larger customer base for sprint pcs and its other network partners 
we receive sprint pcs roaming revenue at a per minute rate from sprint pcs or another sprint pcs network partner when sprint pcs subscribers outside of our territory use our network 
in accordance with an agreement in principle announced in april  sprint pcs provided notice of reduction of the reciprocal roaming rate from to per minute of use on june   and to per minute of use on october  the details of the agreement in principle with respect to periods after december  have not yet been finalized  but the reciprocal rate cannot be less than per minute until after december  as a result of these changes  increased inbound roaming minutes from a growing sprint pcs subscriber base will be partially offset by the lower per minute rate 
cost of service and roaming the cost of service and roaming was million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of million 
cost of service and roaming includes roaming expense when customers from our territory place calls on sprint pcs network or other wireless networks and costs to support the airgate customer base including network operating costs including salaries  cell site lease payments  fees related to the connection of our switches to the cell cites that they support  inter connect fees and other expenses related to network operations  back office services provided by sprint pcs such as customer care  billing and activation  the of collected service revenue representing the sprint affiliation fee  the provision for doubtful accounts and long distance expense relating to inbound roaming revenue and the long distance cost of customers in our territory 
roaming expense included in the cost of service and roaming was million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of million resulting from the substantial increase in our customer base 
as discussed above  the per minute rate we pay sprint pcs when customers from our territory roam onto sprint pcs or an affiliate s network decreased beginning june  the increased roaming costs resulting from increasing subscriber levels in our territory will be partially offset by the lower per minute rate paid to sprint pcs

cost of equipment cost of equipment was million for the year ended september   and million for the year ended september   an increase of million 
this increase is attributable to the increase in the number of customers  as cost of equipment includes the cost of handsets and accessories sold to customers from our sprint pcs stores 
the cost of handsets generally exceeds the amount received from customers because we subsidize the price of handsets to remain competitive in the marketplace 
selling and marketing we incurred selling and marketing expenses of million during the year ended september  compared to million in the year ended september   an increase of million
