accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet 
the company s use of derivative financial instruments to date has been limited to entering interest rate hedge contracts to reduce interest rate risk with respect to anticipated public debt issuances 
based on the company s current use of derivatives and the limited number of embedded derivatives in existing agreements  sfas is not expected to materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition and deferred costs in financial statements

in the fourth quarter of  in connection with finalizing the new accounting standard for business combinations  the fasb announced its tentative conclusion that goodwill arising from business combinations  including prior business combinations  would no longer be required to be amortized 
goodwill would instead be reviewed for impairment and would be written down only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
the final standard on business combinations is expected to be issued by the fasb by the third quarter of inflation the effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the company s ability to recover certain costs applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process

possible future regulatory changes may alter the company s ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations

the following table reflects the company s debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of and for the years ended december debt to total capitalization percentage ratio of earnings to fixed charges ratio of earnings to fixed charges excluding gain on sale or exchange of assets regulation and competition the communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory  legislative  competitive and technological changes that make it difficult to determine the form or degree of future regulation and competition affecting the company s operations 
these changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies 
events affecting the communications industry in the united states congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act  which obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition 
the act provides certain exemptions for rural lecs such as those operated by the company 
under the fcc s august order implementing most of the act s interconnection provisions  rural lecs have the burden of proving the availability of these exemptions 
prior to and since the enactment of the act  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these cumulative changes have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless services entities are also expected to increasingly compete with lecs 
the act authorized the establishment of new federal and state universal service funds to provide support to eligible telecommunications carriers 
these new funds are intended to replace existing federal support mechanisms that are based on historical cost models and that currently provide approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
the fcc has established a task force to recommend how universal service support should be administered for rural lecs 
this task force has recommended a modified embedded cost model which  if adopted in its current form  would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated revenues or results of operations 
however  if the fcc implements new universal service support mechanisms for rural carriers based on forward looking cost models as it did for non rural carriers in october  the company s consolidated revenues could be negatively impacted 
until new support mechanisms are finalized under the fcc s rulemaking procedures  there can be no assurance that the universal service support mechanism ultimately adopted by the fcc will not negatively affect the company s operations 
on october   a proposed comprehensive reform plan designed to address access rates  universal service  rate of return and separations was filed with the fcc by a multi association group representing small and mid sized telephone companies that currently are regulated under traditional rate of return mechanisms 
the proposed plan attempts to mirror certain principles of the access charge reform plan implemented by the fcc for price cap companies in mid under this plan  companies would have a five year period to transition from their existing forms of rate of return regulation to a new form of incentive regulation 
if adopted in its current form  the plan would not have a material effect on the company s operating revenues or results of operations  however  until the plan is finalized under the rulemaking procedures of the fcc  it is premature to assess the ultimate impact this proposal will have on the company 
there can be no assurance that the plan  in its final form  will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
competition to provide traditional telephone or wireless services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s operations are located 
although the company has increasingly experienced competition in its markets  the company does not believe such competition is likely to materially affect it in the near term 
the company will continue to monitor ongoing changes in regulation  competition and technology and consider which developments provide the most favorable opportunities for the company to pursue 
the company s wireless operations are subject to increased competition from large wireless carriers offering nationwide calling plans 
the company does not offer a nationwide calling plan at this time and may be hindered in its ability to compete for customers seeking nationwide calling plans 
additionally  several wireless carriers have taken initial steps to abandon the tdma standard used by the company and to provide enhanced next generation wireless services utilizing different technologies 
if the company elects to continue to use the tdma standard or to forego implementation of enhanced wireless services  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to receive support from vendors or to compete effectively against competitors using different technologies or offering more services 
recent events affecting the company during the company s revenues from the usf totaled approximately million which includes million related to the newly acquired verizon properties 
during  such revenues totaled million of which million related to the alaska based operations 
although the company may experience a reduction in its federal support revenues at some point in the future  management believes it is premature to assess or estimate the ultimate impact thereof 
there can be no assurance  however  that such impact will not be material 
during the last few years  several states in which the company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the lec business 
the number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the company s service areas has increased in recent years  especially in the newly acquired verizon markets  and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future 
state alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the company s lecs have also affected revenue growth recently 
although the company believes that these plans will be favorable in the future as additional revenue streams are added and cost efficiencies are obtained  these plans slowed revenue growth during because they are more closely tied to access line growth rather than minutes of use growth  which has traditionally grown at a faster rate than access lines 
there can be no assurance that current or future alternative regulation plans will not reduce revenue growth in the future 
certain long distance carriers continue to request that the company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its lecs 
there is no assurance that these requests will not result in reduced intrastate access revenues in the future 
in addition  the company continues to receive pressure from other cellular operators to reduce roaming rates in the company s cellular markets 
in response  the company anticipates that it will enter into agreements that will reduce its roaming rates from current levels 
the company further anticipates that the adverse impact of reduced roaming rates may be partially offset by increased roaming traffic 
in connection with authorizing the company s acquisition from verizon of telephone properties in wisconsin  the wisconsin public service commission wpsc indicated its intent to review the possibility of regulating all of the company s wisconsin local exchange carriers on a unitary basis  which would reduce the company s revenues in wisconsin unless and to the extent the company could mitigate these reductions through rate adjustments or other revenue enhancements approved by the wpsc 
in connection with this authorization  the wpsc also rejected centurytel s request to increase the access rates previously charged by verizon 
if the company s appeal of this ruling is unsuccessful  the verizon acquisitions will dilute the company s earnings more than initially anticipated 
in the fourth quarter of  an administrative law judge in wisconsin issued a ruling  which was accepted by the wpsc  declaring that the company had inappropriately increased access rates it charges to interexchange carriers following the company s acquisition of properties from ameritech on december  such ruling ordered the company to prospectively reduce its access rates and to refund interexchange carriers the difference between the access rates billed by the company and the previous access rates billed by ameritech retroactive to the december  acquisition date 
the company has filed an appeal to the ruling 
if its appeal is unsuccessful  the company anticipates that it will be required to incur a future pre tax charge to earnings of between million 
the company anticipates that regulatory changes and competitive pressures may result in future revenue reductions in its operations 
however  the company anticipates that such reductions may be minimized by increases in revenues attributable to the continued demand for enhanced services and new product offerings 
while the company expects its telephone revenues to continue to grow  its internal telephone revenue growth rate may slow during upcoming periods 
other matters the company s regulated telephone operations are subject to the provisions of sfas  under which the company is required to account for the economic effects of the rate making process  including the recognition of depreciation of plant and equipment over lives approved by regulators 
the ongoing applicability of sfas to the company s regulated telephone operations is being monitored due to the changing regulatory  competitive and legislative environments 
when the regulated operations of the company no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the net adjustments required will result in a material  extraordinary  noncash charge against earnings 
while the amount of such charge cannot be precisely estimated at this time  management believes that the noncash  after tax  extraordinary charge would be between million and million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has certain obligations based on federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment 
costs of compliance through have not been material  and the company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the majority of the company s long term debt obligations are fixed rate 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
for purposes hereof  market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates which represents ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt 
as of december   the company owed million of debt on a floating rate basis 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into interest rate hedge contracts designed to reduce its interest rate risk with respect to million of long term public debt that it ultimately expected to incur in connection with providing long term financing for its verizon acquisitions 
the company recorded a million charge to earnings in related to the settlement of certain of these hedge contracts
