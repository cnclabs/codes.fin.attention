item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as conditions allow  the company intends to consider increasing the number of shopko retail stores to achieve economies of scale and to capitalize on the company s existing infrastructure 
the company s plans with respect to new store growth are subject to change  and the company cannot assure that it will achieve its plans 
competition shopko retail the discount general merchandise business is very competitive 
shopko competes in most of its markets with a variety of national  regional and local discount stores  national category killers  specialty niche retailers  catalog merchants and internet retailers 
in addition  department stores compete in some branded merchandise lines  discount specialty retail chains compete in some merchandise lines such as health and beauty aids  household cleaning and supplies  electronics  bed and bath  housewares  casual furniture and toys  and pharmaceutical and optical operations compete with some of shopko s pharmacy and optical centers 
shopko believes that the principal competitive factors in its markets include o store location  o differentiated merchandising  o competitive pricing  o quality of product selection  o attractiveness and cleanliness of the stores  o responsiveness to changing lifestyle needs and regional and local trends  o customer service  o in stock availability of merchandise  and o advertising 
shopko s principal national general merchandise discount chain competitors are wal mart  kmart and target  each of which is substantially larger than  and has greater resources than  the company 
of the shopko stores remaining after reorganization  the percentage of stores where these competitors are present is as follows o wal mart o kmart o target shopko also competes with regional chains in some markets in the midwest and the pacific northwest 
these competitors continue to open new stores in shopko s markets 
historically  the entry of one of these chains into an area served by a shopko store generally has had an adverse effect on the affected store s sales growth for approximately months 
after the month time period  the shopko store generally has resumed a positive growth trend 
entry by one of these competitors into a shopko market often has resulted in permanently intensified price competition 
the company s efficiency measures and distribution center expenditures are important aspects of shopko s efforts to maintain or improve operating margins and market share in these markets 
seasonality shopko retail shopko s retail general merchandise operations are highly seasonal 
historically  shopko s third and fourth fiscal quarters have contributed a significant part of the company s earnings due to the christmas selling season 
pamida retail on july   the company acquired all of the outstanding voting and nonvoting common stock of pamida  inc pamida for million in cash  million in assumed debt and million in assumed trade and other accrued liabilities 
pamida is a retail chain headquartered in omaha  nebraska 
merchandising philosophy pamida retail pamida strategy is to offer consumers in small  rural communities a convenient one stop shopping format 
a typical store carries a broad assortment of value priced hardlines and softlines merchandise as well as consumables  and stores have pharmacy centers 
pamida stores generally are located in small towns where there often is less competition from another major general merchandise retailer and which pamida considers to be either too small to support more than one major general merchandise retailer thereby creating a potential barrier to entry by a major competitor or too small to attract competitors whose stores generally are designed to serve larger populations 
pamida s merchandising strategy is to provide customers with a reliable and convenient family shopping experience featuring nationally advertised brand name products as well as select private label merchandise at competitive prices 
pamida stores are self service 
advertising circulars are run weekly 
pamida places special emphasis on maintaining a strong in stock position in all merchandise categories

o lawn and garden  as of february   pamida owned and operated pharmacies in of its stores  five of pamida s pharmacies are leased to and operated by independent pharmacists 
the pharmacies have proven to be effective in building customer loyalty and attracting customers who are likely to purchase other items in addition to prescription drugs 
pamida intends to continue to grow its pharmacy base 
marketing and advertising pamida retail pamida s advertising primarily utilizes colorful weekly circulars developed by a centralized advertising staff 
circulars advertise brand name and other merchandise at competitive prices 
pamida retail store layout and design pamida typically invests approximately to million in a new prototype store 
such expenditures consist primarily of approximately to million for building and land costs  to million for the initial store inventory net of to million financed by vendors and approximately million for store fixtures and equipment 
pamida s stores average approximately  square feet of sales area and range in size from approximately  to  square feet of sales area 
pamida uses a  or  square foot prototype when building new stores 
pamida retail store operations and management the methods that pamida employs to build customer loyalty and satisfaction are weekly advertised specials  competitive pricing  clean and orderly stores  friendly well trained personnel and a liberal return policy 
purchasing and distribution pamida retail pamida maintains a centralized purchasing  merchandise allocation and space planning staff at its central offices 
pamida s point of sale data capture equipment located in its stores provides current information to pamida s buyers to assist them in managing inventories  effecting prompt reorders of popular items  eliminating slow selling merchandise and reducing markdowns 
centralized purchasing enables pamida to more effectively control the cost of merchandise and to take advantage of promotional programs and volume discounts offered by certain vendors 
pamida continuously seeks to optimize merchandise costs 
pamida has entered into an agreement with payless shoesource  inc to be the primary vendor within the shoe category 
pamida operates distribution facilities in omaha  nebraska  lebanon  indiana  and bethany  missouri  all of which serve primarily as distribution centers for bulk shipments and promotional and replenishment merchandise on which cost savings can be realized through quantity purchasing 
during fiscal  approximately of pamida s merchandise was distributed to the stores through these distribution centers  while the remaining merchandise was supplied directly to the stores by manufacturers or distributors 
the primary omaha distribution facility consists of  square feet 
pamida owns another distribution center in omaha which is  square feet 
during fiscal  the company doubled the size of the lebanon distribution center from  square feet to  square feet and converted it to a full service operation providing both full case and less than case merchandise distribution  similar to the omaha facility 
including the  square foot distribution center in bethany  missouri that was part of the places acquisition discussed below  pamida increased its distribution center square footage by in fiscal management information systems pamida retail pamida s information technology strategy is to implement systems that result in a low cost of operation and maintenance  while retaining the flexibility to adapt to a rapidly changing retail and technology environment 
over the course of the fiscal year  pamida will be engaged in a number of projects to upgrade its systems infrastructure  including installation of a new space and assortment planning system  the addition of gift card and non receipt returns  the installation of a new retail management system  the addition of advanced shipping notice and the upgrade of several auxiliary decision support systems 
expansion pamida retail on june   the company acquired the retail chain pm place stores company places which operated discount stores in missouri  iowa  kansas  and illinois 
forty eight of these stores were reopened as pamida stores and one places store  located in an existing pamida location  was closed 
during fiscal  pamida opened new stores  including the converted places stores  and closed four stores  increasing the total number of pamida stores to as of february  the company expects that growth of the pamida retail store base for the next few years will be below the growth achieved by the company since it acquired pamida 
although the company does not currently anticipate pursuing growth of the pamida retail business in fiscal  through the addition of new stores  the company intends to return to modest store growth as conditions allow and the company has identified numerous communities which are potential sites for pamida s prototype stores and in which it believes it can achieve a leading market position 
there is  however  no assurance that the company will open stores in such communities or on any particular time schedule 
competition pamida retail the general merchandise retail business is highly competitive 
pamida s stores generally compete with other general merchandise retailers  supermarkets  drug and specialty stores  mail order and catalog merchants  internet retailers and  in some communities  department stores 
the type and degree of competition and the number of competitors with which pamida s stores compete vary by market 
pamida stores generally are located in small towns where there is no direct local competition from another major general merchandise retailer and which may be either too small to support more than one major general merchandise retailer thereby creating a potential barrier to entry by a major competitor or too small to attract competitors whose stores generally are designed to serve larger populations 
the following is a recap of major competition as a percent of the pamida markets where the competition is present o wal mart o kmart o alco o target in recent years pamida s business strategy has been to focus its store expansion program on communities with less likelihood of the entry of a new major competitor  but there can be no assurance that in the future major competitors will not open additional stores in pamida s markets 
seasonality pamida retail pamida s business  like that of most other general merchandise retailers  is seasonal 
first quarter sales are lower than sales during the other three fiscal quarters  while fourth quarter sales amount to approximately of the full year s sales and normally involve a greater proportion of higher margin merchandise 
discontinued operations at the start of fiscal  the company maintained a ownership interest in provantage health services  inc provantage 
provantage provides health benefit management services  pharmacy mail services  vision benefit management services and health information technology and clinical support services 
on june   the company sold its interest in provantage pursuant to a tender offer by a third party to acquire all of the outstanding shares of provantage 
for financial information regarding the sale see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated employees the company employs approximately  persons in its shopko division  of whom approximately  are full time employees and  are part time employees 
pamida employs approximately  persons 
during the christmas shopping season  the company typically employs additional persons on a temporary basis 
approximately   employees were terminated as a result of the reorganization announced on january  most of the employees were terminated as liquidation of the closed store inventories was completed 
none of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
government regulation the company s pharmacy and optical services business is subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations governing  among other things licensure and regulation of retail pharmacies and optical centers there are extensive federal and state regulations applicable to the practice of pharmacy and optometry at the retail level 
most states have laws and regulations governing the operation and licensing of pharmacies and optical centers  and regulate standards of professional practice by pharmacy and optical service providers 
these regulations are issued by an administrative body in each state  typically a pharmacy board or board of optometry  which is empowered to impose sanctions for non compliance 
future legislative initiatives legislative and regulatory initiatives pertaining to such healthcare related issues as reimbursement policies  payment practices  therapeutic substitution programs  and other healthcare cost containment issues are frequently introduced at both the state and federal level 
the company is unable to predict accurately whether or when legislation may be enacted or regulations may be adopted relating to the company s pharmacy and optical services operations or what the effect of such legislation or regulations may be 
substantial compliance the company s management believes the company is in substantial compliance with  or is in the process of complying with  all existing statutes and regulations material to the operation of the company s pharmacy and optical services businesses and  to date  no state or federal agency has taken enforcement action against the company for any material non compliance  and to the company s knowledge  no such enforcement against the company is presently contemplated 
forward looking statements and risk factors in accordance with the private securities litigation reform act of  the company can obtain a safe harbor for forward looking statements by identifying those statements and by accompanying those statements with cautionary statements which identify factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward looking statements 
accordingly  the following information contains or may contain forward looking statements information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including  without limitation  statements made under item  business  and under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  information included or incorporated by reference in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission sec including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth  acquisition and expansion plans  financing plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings  costs and capital expenditures  and product development and product roll out plans  and information contained in written material  releases and oral statements issued by  or on behalf of  the company including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth  acquisition and expansion plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings  costs and capital expenditures  and product development and product roll out plans 
the company s actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  i the risk factors described below  and ii other risks described from time to time in the company s sec filings 
an investment in shopko s common stock or other securities carries certain risks 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below and other risks which may be disclosed from time to time in shopko s filings with the sec before investing in shopko s common stock or other securities 
the company has a significant amount of debt which could adversely affect its business and growth prospects 
at february   the company had approximately million of long term debt and other long term obligations 
on march   the company consummated a new  three year senior secured credit facility the secured credit facility 
the restrictions and limitations in the secured credit facility  as well as the significant amount of debt in general  could have significant adverse effects on its business 
for example  it o makes it more difficult for the company to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  o restricts capital expenditures  o requires the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of its debt and the interest on its debt  o limits the company s ability to open new stores or to make acquisitions  o limits the company s ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities  o makes the company more vulnerable to economic downturns  adverse retail industry conditions and competitive pressures  and subjects the company to certain covenants which restrict its ability to operate its business 
the company may not achieve the expected benefits of current or future reorganizations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced a strategic reorganization plan to improve the productivity of its assets and reduce debt 
the plan included store and distribution center closings and a one time charge to earnings of approximately million 
the company expects that the implementation of the plan will result in an increase in the company s profitability and efficiency 
however  the analysis underlying this plan involved many variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the company may not achieve any of the expected benefits 
the company cannot assure you that additional reorganizations of this nature  together with related charges to earnings  will not be required in the future to improve the productivity and efficiency in the company s shopko and pamida segments 
such reorganizations and charges to earnings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the company may be unable to execute its expansion plans  which may have a significant adverse effect on its financial performance and its growth strategy and prospects 
the company considers expansion in the number of its retail stores to be an integral part of its plan to achieve projected operating results in future years 
in an effort to reduce the company s overall debt  as well as  comply with the restrictions and limitations in the secured credit facility  the company does not anticipate opening any new retail stores in and may reduce its store expansion plans in future years 
furthermore  the company expects that any new stores will typically require an extended period of time to reach the sales and profitability levels of its existing stores 
the opening of any new stores does not ensure that those stores will ever be as profitable as existing stores  especially when those new stores are opened in highly competitive markets 
the failure to expand by opening new retail stores as planned and the failure to generate anticipated sales and earnings growth in markets where new stores are opened could have a material adverse effect on the company s future sales growth and profitability 
if the company is not able to remodel its existing store base on schedule or to carry out such plans in a cost effective manner  then the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that remodeling its stores is a necessary aspect of delivering comprehensive value to its customers and maintaining its upscale image 
in an effort to reduce the company s overall debt  as well as  comply with the restrictions and limitations in the secured credit facility  the company has reduced its capital expenditure plans for and may be required to delay scheduled remodeling of its retail stores 
the failure to upgrade the company s existing retail stores could have a material adverse effect on the company s anticipated sales and profitability 
to the extent the company is able to upgrade its existing stores  the associated expenses could result in a significant impact on our net income in the future and there can be no assurance that these upgrades will generate any of the anticipated benefits 
the company s quarterly performance fluctuates  which may cause volatility or a decline in the price of its securities 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results have occurred in the past and may occur in the future based on a variety of factors  including o seasonality in the company s operations  especially during the christmas selling season which has historically contributed a significant part of the company s earnings and primarily impacts the fourth fiscal quarter  o inventory imbalances caused by unanticipated fluctuations in consumer demand or inefficiencies in the company s distribution centers and methods  o margin rate compression resulting from competitive pricing pressure  o increases and decreases in advertising and promotional expenses  o changes in the company s product mix  o the ability to manage operating expenses  and o the competitive and general economic conditions discussed below 
these fluctuations could cause the company s operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of its securities 
competition in the retail industry could limit shopko s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business 
this business is highly competitive 
the competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability 
the company competes with other discount retail merchants as well as mass merchants  catalog merchants  internet retailers and other general merchandise  apparel and household merchandise retailers 
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the competition for customers and store locations has intensified in recent years as larger competitors  such as wal mart  kmart and target  have moved into the company s geographic markets 
the company expects a further increase in competition from these national discount retailers 
the company cannot assure you that it will be able to continue to compete successfully 
general economic conditions and adverse weather could have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
the company operates its retail stores in limited regions of the country 
to the extent adverse economic conditions and weather have a regional impact on the regions in which the company operates the company may be disproportionately susceptible to such factors compared to peers that have a larger national base of operations 
general economic factors in the regions in which the company operates that are beyond its control may materially adversely affect its forecasts and actual performance 
the factors that may materially adversely affect its forecasts and actual performance include energy prices  interest rates  recession  inflation  deflation  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  tax rates and policy  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
because the company s business is subject to adverse weather conditions in its retail markets  particularly in the midwest  western mountain and pacific northwest regions  its operating results may be unexpectedly and materially adversely affected 
frequent or unusually heavy snow  ice or rain storms in its markets could have a material adverse effect on its sales and earnings and could adversely impact its ability to make scheduled interest payments on its indebtedness 
loss of the company s key management personnel  especially william j 
podany  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  could materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company s success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of its senior management  particularly william j 
podany 
the company does not have employment contracts with members of its senior management  including mr 
podany 
if the company loses key senior management  then its business could be materially adversely affected 
labor conditions may have a material adverse impact on its performance 
if the company cannot attract and retain quality employees  its business will suffer 
the company depends on attracting and retaining quality employees 
many of its employees are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
the company may be unable to meet its labor needs while controlling costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics 
anti takeover provisions in the company s organizational documents and statutes may inhibit premium offers for its common stock 
anti takeover provisions in its amended and restated articles of incorporation  by laws and wisconsin law and its rights plan may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control of the company 
this could make the company less attractive to a potential acquirer and deprive its shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at a premium price 
pending or future litigation could subject the company to significant monetary damages 
if the company becomes subject to liability claims which are in excess of its insurance coverage or are not covered by its insurance policies  the company may be liable for damages and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any claims against the company  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may have a material adverse effect on its reputation and business 
the sale of retail merchandise and provision of in store pharmacy and optical services entail a risk of litigation and liability 
the company is currently subject to a number of lawsuits  and expects that from time to time it will be subject to similar suits in the ordinary course of business 
the company currently maintains insurance intended to cover a majority of liability claims  subject to a  deductible for general liability claims and for liability claims arising from prescription dispensing errors 
the company believes that its insurance programs are adequate 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to maintain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  or that insurance will cover all claims against the company
