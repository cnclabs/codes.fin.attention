interest and other income totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest was primarily the result of earnings from investment of larger cash reserves during the year as well as higher interest rates and interest received from taxing authorities 
if the final plan is consummated  interest income in will decrease because the company s cash reserves will be substantially reduced due to debt amortization  payments which would be made under the united states settlement  dividend distributions and deposits of the subject refunds into the tax escrow

for the year ended december  expenses totaled million and included million of depreciation expense on real estate assets and million of interest on the bank credit agreement and other debt 
the million variance in expenses was due primarily to a a charge in of million related to the united states settlement  b an increased charge to earnings in of million for unpaid rent from tenants versus million in the same period in the prior year  which primarily includes the difference between the minimum monthly base rent that would be due under the terms of the master leases with vencor and the base rent that was paid under the terms of the stipulation  c increased interest expense and d increased general and administrative expenses

as a result of delays in the extended vencor bankruptcy proceeding and the determination that such an amount is uncollectible  the company wrote off approximately million and million of rents receivable from tenants for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the write off consists of the following s in thousands the difference between the minimum monthly base rent under the master leases and stipulation   august monthly base rent under the master leases  charge for rent due under a lease with vencor which is under dispute rent due from non vencor tenants for the year ended december   interest expense increased to million from million for the same period in the prior year

the increase was offset by reductions in federal excise tax 
professional fees totaled approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease relates primarily to the reduction in unusual professional fees million in and million in incurred as a result of ongoing negotiations with vencor 
fees incurred in the third and fourth quarter of were significant in connection with vencor s bankruptcy filing and in connection with the company s business strategy alternatives as discussed above in recent developments regarding vencor and recent developments regarding liquidity

during the fourth quarter of  a tenant at one of the company s facilities ceased paying rent on the facility leased by it and filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
the company deemed the asset to be impaired and recorded an impairment loss of million to write down the asset to its estimated fair value as of december  the company incurred million and million in non recurring employee severance costs in the first quarter of and in connection with the spin off and the consummation of the bank credit agreement  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of million at december  to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt 
on august   the company entered into an agreement with the interest rate swap agreement counterparty to shorten the maturity of the interest rate swap agreement from december  to june   in exchange for a payment in from the counterparty to the company of million 
so long as the company has debt in excess of million  the company will amortize the million payment for financial accounting purposes in future periods beginning in july and ending in december on january   the company further amended the swap agreement  pursuant to which the parties agreed  for purposes of certain calculations set forth in the swap agreement  to continue to use certain defined terms set forth in the bank credit agreement 
the company paid million in related to the interest rate swap agreement which is included in interest expense 
for the year ended december   the company received million related to the interest rate swap which is included in interest expense 
the period from may  to december  rental revenue for the period from may  to december  totaled million  of which million resulted from leases with vencor 
operating expenses totaled million and included million of depreciation expense on real estate assets and million of interest on bank credit facilities and other debt 
interest expense also included million in net payments on the interest rate swap agreement and million in amortization and deferred financing fees 
the company also recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million for the period from may  to december  income from operations was million  or per share 
the company incurred an extraordinary loss for the period from may  to december  of million  or per share  net of income taxes  related to the extinguishment of debt 
net income for the period from may  to december  was million  or per diluted share 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo for the years ended december  and totaled million or per diluted share and million or per diluted share  respectively 
ffo for the period from may  to december  totaled million  or per diluted share 
ffo for the years ended december  and has been decreased for the aforementioned unusual professional fees  write off of tenant receivables and asset impairment expense and non recurring employee severance costs 
in calculating ffo for the period from may  to december   the company has added back to net income the million of income tax expense to be consistent with the and presentations when no income taxes are assumed to be due because of the company s qualification as a reit 
ffo for the years ended december  and and the period from may  to december  is summarized in the following table for the period from year ended year ended may  to december  december  december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss    extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt   income loss before extraordinary loss    provision for income taxes  depreciation on real estate assets    united states settlement  realized gain on sale of assets funds from operations    ffo per diluted share shares outstanding  diluted    the company considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit and the company uses the nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation for real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in july of  nareit revised the definition of ffo to include the add back of impairment losses to gaap net income to arrive at ffo 
the company did not book any impairment in ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of the company s overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses the company s integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk the following discussion of the company s exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company earns revenue by leasing its assets under leases that primarily are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
the company s debt obligations are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in libor 
see note borrowing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements 
the general fixed nature of the company s assets and the variable nature of the company s debt obligations creates interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  the company s lease revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  at or about the date the company spun off its health care operations in connection with the spin off  it also entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount 
as of december   the company had an million interest rate swap outstanding with a highly rated counterparty in which the company pays a fixed rate of and receives libor from the counterparty 
the interest rate swap agreement originally was in a notional amount of billion and would have expired in varying amounts on december of each year through december  on august   the company entered into an agreement with the interest rate swap agreement counterparty to shorten the maturity of the interest rate swap agreement from december  to june   in exchange for a payment from the counterparty to the company of million 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement is scheduled to decline from million as of december  as follows amount date  december   december  june  when interest rates rise the interest rate swap agreement increases in fair value to the company and when interest rates fall the interest rate swap agreement declines in value to the company 
as of december   interest rates had fallen and the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the company of approximately million 
as of december  the interest rates had risen and the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized gain position to the company of approximately million 
to highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swap agreement to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and december  notional amount   fair value to the company   fair value to the company reflecting change in interest rates bps   bps   the terms of this interest rate swap agreement require that the company make a cash payment or otherwise post collateral to the counterparty if the fair value loss to the company exceeds certain levels the threshold levels 
see note borrowing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements 
the threshold levels vary based on the relationship between the company s debt obligations and the tangible fair value of its assets as defined in the bank credit agreement and outlined below threshold debt to tangible fmv level to  to  or lower  as of december   the company believes that the threshold level under the interest rate swap agreement was a fair value unrealized loss of million and the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the company of million 
under the interest rate swap agreement  if collateral must be posted  the principal amount of such collateral must equal the difference between the fair value unrealized loss of the interest rate swap agreement at the time of such determination and the threshold amount 
on january   the company entered into a letter agreement with the counterparty to the swap agreement for the purpose of amending the swap agreement 
the letter agreement provides that  for purposes of certain calculations set forth in the swap agreement  the parties agree to continue to use certain defined terms set forth in the bank credit agreement 
as of december  and december   the interest rate swap agreement was in a position under the threshold level  and therefore no collateral was required to be posted under the interest rate swap agreement 
the differences in the company s market risk exposure relating to the interest rate swap agreement at december  and were caused by fluctuations in interest rates and by changes in the notional amounts 
credit risk the company monitors credit risk under its lease agreements with its tenants by monitoring publicly available financial information  discussions with its tenants and review of information otherwise available to the company 
pursuant to the spin off  the company has a significant concentration of credit risk under its amended master leases 
for the year ended december  lease rental revenues from vencor totaled million or of the company s total rental income for the period million or  net of write offs 
for the year ended december  and for the period from may  to december   lease rental revenues from vencor comprised million or million or  net of write offs and million  or approximately  respectively  of the company s total lease rental revenues of million million after write offs for the year ended december  and million for the period from may  to december  accordingly  vencor s financial condition and ability to meet its rent obligations will determine the company s rental revenues and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders 
the operations of vencor were negatively impacted by changes in reimbursement rates  by its level of indebtedness and by certain other factors 
vencor filed for protection under the bankruptcy code on september  the company  vencor and vencor s major creditors restructured vencor s debt and lease obligations and on march   the bankruptcy court entered an order on its docket confirming the final plan 
consummation of the final plan is subject to the satisfaction of numerous conditions  many of which are outside the control of the company and vencor 
see business risk factors conditions to consummation of the final plan 
the terms of the stipulation currently governs the rental payments to be made under the master leases 
in addition  certain other tenants of the company have experienced financial difficulty and or filed for bankruptcy 
see risk factors recent developments regarding vencor  effects of bankruptcy proceedings and governmental regulation 
in addition  any failure by vencor to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities 
there can be no assurance that vencor will have sufficient assets  income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the master leases or following the vencor effective date if it occurs  under the amended master leases 
since the company derives in excess of of its rental revenues from vencor and since the master leases or following the vencor effective date if it occurs  the amended master leases  are triple net leases under which vencor is responsible for all insurance  taxes and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties  the inability of vencor to satisfy its obligations under the master leases or following the vencor effective date if it occurs  under the amended master leases  would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the leased properties  as well as a material adverse effect on the company

liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash provided by operations totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and million for the period from may  to december  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million and included proceeds from the sale of two facilities 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the period from may  to december  for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was and included dividend payments of million  repayments of borrowings of million and deferred financing costs of million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  and net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the period from may  to december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and from a payment received in connection with the shortening of the company s interest rate swap  net of dividends paid 
credit facility in connection with the spin off  the company refinanced substantially all of its long term debt 
in connection with the refinancing arrangements  the company entered into the bank credit agreement and retained approximately million of prior debt obligations 
as of december   the outstanding balances under the bank credit agreement amounted to million 
on january   the company and all of its lenders entered into the amended credit agreement  which amended and restated the bank credit agreement 
under the amended credit agreement  borrowings bear interest at an applicable margin over an interest rate selected by the company 
such interest rate may be either a the base rate  which is the greater of i the prime rate or ii the federal funds rate plus basis points  or b libor 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement are comprised of a new million revolving credit line the revolving credit line that expires on december   which bears interest at either libor plus or the base rate plus  a million term loan due december  the tranche a loan  which bears interest at either libor plus or the base rate plus  a million term loan due december  the tranche b loan  which bears interest at either libor plus or the base rate plus  and a million term loan due december  the tranche c loan  which bears interest at either libor plus or the base rate plus 
the interest rate on the tranche b loan will reduce by 
basis points once million of the tranche b loan has been repaid 
in addition  in connection with the consummation of the amended credit agreement on january   the company paid a million loan restructuring fee 
the fee is being amortized proportionately over the terms of the related loans and agreements 
under the terms of the amended credit agreement  it would have been an event of default if the vencor effective date did not occur on or before the vencor effective date deadline 
when it became apparent that the vencor effective date would not occur by december   the company initiated discussions with the administrative agent for the lenders under the amended credit agreement in an effort to obtain a waiver or amendment of this covenant 
the company and substantially all of its lenders entered into an amendment and waiver  whereby the vencor effective date deadline was extended from december  to march  in consideration for this extension  the company paid a fee of million to the lenders executing the amendment and waiver and agreed to amend the principal amortization schedules of certain of the loans under the amended credit agreement 
the company exercised its option under the amendment and waiver to extend the vencor effective date deadline from march  to april  in consideration of this extension  the company paid a fee of approximately million to the lenders that executed the amendment and waiver 
under the amendment and waiver  the company has the further options to extend the vencor effective date deadline through a may  in exchange for the payment on or before april  of a fee equal to per annum on the outstanding principal balance of the loans under the amended credit agreement  and b june  in exchange for the payment on or before may  of a fee equal to per annum on the outstanding principal balance of the loans under the amended credit agreement 
under the terms of the amended credit agreement  an event of default will be deemed to have occurred if the vencor effective date does not occur on or before the vencor effective date deadline  as same may be extended 
subject to any defenses available to the company  if such an event of default were to occur  the company could be required to immediately repay all the indebtedness under the amended credit agreement upon the demand of the required lenders  as defined in the amended credit agreement 
if it appears that the vencor effective date will not occur by the vencor effective date deadline  as extended  the company intends to initiate discussions with the administrative agent for its lenders under the amended credit agreement to obtain a waiver or amendment of this covenant 
under the amended credit agreement  a waiver or amendment of this covenant must be approved by lenders holding in the aggregate greater than of the total credit exposure under the amended credit agreement 
there can be no assurance i that the final plan or an alternate plan of reorganization for vencor will become effective on or before the vencor effective date deadline  as same may be extended  ii that the company will obtain a waiver or amendment of the covenant if the final plan or an alternate plan of reorganization for vencor does not become effective on or before the vencor effective date deadline  as same may be extended  iii that the terms of such a waiver or amendment would not have a material adverse effect on the company  or iv that the failure to obtain such a waiver or amendment would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the amended credit agreement  as revised by the amendment and waiver  provides for the following amortization schedule a with respect to the tranche a loan  i million was paid at closing on january   ii million was paid on december   iii million was paid on march   and iv after the vencor effective date  all excess cash flow pursuant to a monthly sweep as more fully described below the monthly sweep will be applied to the tranche a loan until million in total has been paid down on the amended credit agreement  with the remaining principal balance of the tranche a loan due december   b with respect to the tranche b loan  i million was paid on march   ii a one time paydown of excess cash as defined in the amended credit agreement is scheduled to be made on or before the thirtieth day after the vencor effective date as more fully described below the b sweep  iii million is scheduled to be paid on december  and million is scheduled to be paid on december   and iv the remaining principal balance is due december   and c with respect to the tranche c loan  there are no scheduled paydowns of principal and the final maturity is scheduled for december  the facilities under the amended credit agreement are pre payable without premium or penalty

currently  the company believes that it will not be required to pay any amounts under the b sweep 
the first monthly sweep is scheduled to be made on the last day of the month following the first full calendar month after the date that is thirty days after the vencor effective date and will cover the period from days after the vencor effective date to the end of the last day of the month preceding the payment date 
thereafter  the monthly sweep will be made on the last business day of each month for the preceding month 
the monthly sweep will be in an amount equal to the company s total cash receipts for the applicable period  minus the sum of i cash disbursements by the company during the applicable period  ii up to million for a working capital reserve  iii a reserve in an amount equal to the unpaid minimum reit dividend for all prior periods and for the current calendar quarter  iv the obligations due under the united states settlement during the next three months  v taxes and vi other specified amounts

dividends in order to continue to qualify as a reit  the company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least for tax years ending after december  of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gain 
the company elected to qualify as a reit for the year ending december  the company believes that it has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a reit for the tax year ended december  and the company intends to continue to qualify as a reit for the tax year ending december  and subsequent years 
the company paid dividends equal to of its taxable income for on january  the company paid a dividend of per share for which amount is equal to of the company s estimated taxable income for the company intends to pay a dividend for equal to at least of the company s taxable income for the dividend may be satisfied by a combination of cash or other property or securities 
it is expected that the company s reit taxable income will be less than its cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing reit taxable income 
however  this would be partially offset by the value of the new vencor common stock that would be received by the company if the final plan is consummated  which would be included in taxable income in the year received by the company 
the company anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the for taxable years beginning after december  distribution requirement 
it is possible  however  that the company  from time to time  may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the for taxable years beginning after december  distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation 
see business risk factors risks associated with reit status inability to maintain required distributions  market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters and business federal income tax considerations 
capital expenditures and property acquisitions capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by the tenants 
accordingly  the company does not believe that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties 
after the terms of the leases expire  or in the event that the tenants are unable to meet their obligations under the leases  the company anticipates that any expenditures for which it may become responsible to maintain the leased properties will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings 
to the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required  the company s liquidity may be affected adversely 
the company s ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of the amended credit agreement 
any such capital expenditures or borrowings would likely require the consent of the required lenders under the amended credit agreement  and there can be no assurance that such consent would be obtained 
the company invested million during the period from may  to december  to acquire health care related properties 
the properties purchased included two skilled nursing facilities and eight personal care facilities 
one of the properties acquired was a skilled nursing facility purchased from vencor under the development agreement for million in the third quarter of the company did not acquire any properties in or and does not currently intend to acquire any additional properties in other the company loaned  with interest provisions  approximately million  net of repayments  to certain current and former executive officers of the company to finance the income taxes payable by them as a result of the vesting of common stock of the company awarded as compensation to such officers the restricted stock and the spin off
