item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included within this report 
overview we are a leading chemistry research and drug discovery and development company focused on applications for the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and life sciences industries 
we engage in comprehensive chemistry research from lead discovery  optimization and development to commercial manufacturing 
we perform chemistry research for many of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and for our own internal research and development 
net contract revenue our net contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers  net of our reimbursed expenses 
reimbursed expenses consist of laboratory supplies  chemicals and other costs reimbursed by our customers and  in accordance with industry practice  are netted against gross contract revenue 
reimbursed expenses vary from contract to contract 
accordingly  we view net contract revenue as our primary measure of revenue growth rather than licensing fees and royalties  which are dependent upon our licensee s sales 
in general  we provide services to our customers on the following basis a full time equivalent basis that establishes the number of full time equivalents contracted for a project or a series of projects  the duration of the contract period  the fixed price per full time equivalent  plus an allowance for out of pocket expenses which may or may not be incorporated in the full time equivalent rate  a time and materials basis under which we charge our customers based on an hourly rate plus out of pocket expenses  or to a lesser extent  a fixed price basis 
typically  our full time equivalent contracts have terms of six months or longer and our time and materials contracts have terms of one to twelve months 
fixed price contracts are entered into for much shorter periods of time  generally two to six months 
because our fixed price contracts relate to projects that are generally limited in scope and are of short duration  we have not historically experienced any material cost overruns under these contracts 
full time equivalent and time and materials contracts provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon to days prior notice 
we recognize contract revenue on a percentage of completion or per diem basis 
cost of revenue consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees and other direct project related costs 
licensing fees  milestones and royalties many of our contracts for discovery technology services contain provisions for licensing  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology  including enzymes  microbial manipulation and combinatorial chemistry  lead to discovery of new products that reach the market 
to date  we have received substantially all of our milestone and royalty payments under these arrangements from aventis with respect to allegra 
non recurring licensing fees  milestones and royalties 
although we entered into a license agreement with aventis in  we began to recognize royalty revenue related to sales in the united states under that agreement in february this delay was due to the significant time expended for issuance of our patents and the resolution of related patent interference claims by aventis 
in  we received from aventis million in non recurring milestone payments and million in royalties related to prior periods 
recurring royalties 
recurring royalties consist of royalties from aventis under a license agreement based on sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
royalty payments are due within days after each calendar quarter and are determined based on sales in that quarter 
costs and expenses cost of contract revenue 
our cost of contract revenue  from which we derive gross profit from net contract revenue  consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees and other direct project related costs 
technology incentive award 
we maintain a technology development incentive plan designed to stimulate and encourage novel technology development by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor 
under our technology development incentive plan  thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman and chief executive officer  receives payments as the sole inventor on the patents for fexofenadine hcl equal to of the total payments received by us with respect to those patents 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of payments in connection with collaborations with academic institutions  compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary research projects and costs of supplies and related chemicals 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing and administrative employees  professional services  marketing costs and all costs related to facilities and information services 
other income expense other income expense consists of interest income  interest expense  our equity in our unconsolidated affiliates  organichem and fluorous technologies  realized gains or losses on sales of investment securities and other non operating expenses 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net contract revenue 
net contract revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in this increase was due principally to a greater number of projects under contract primarily for medicinal and chemical development services 
this increase was facilitated by an increase in the number of scientific staff to at december  from at december  recurring royalties

we did not receive any non recurring licensing fees  milestones or royalties in as a result of the february united states patent trademark office decision  we met all prerequisites of the licensing agreement with aventis and recognized and received in the first three months of milestone payments and royalties on all sales of fexofenadine hcl in the united states from november   the date of patent issuance  through december  our milestones and royalties from fexofenadine hcl for include million in non recurring milestone payments and million in royalties related to prior periods and  as a result  such milestone payments and royalties may not be indicative of future amounts earned under the license agreement with aventis 
in particular  no further milestone payments are required under the agreement

income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the effective rate for our provision for income taxes was in as compared to for liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
for the year ended december   we generated cash of million from operating activities 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
capital expenditures in were predominantly in connection with the expansion of our facilities in rensselaer  new york and iowa city  iowa 
additionally  we acquired three additional properties during  one in syracuse  new york for approximately million and two in albany  new york for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we are presently renovating the syracuse  new york property and expect to incur approximately in renovation costs 
we used approximately  of operating cash flows to fund a portion of the purchase price for american advanced organics  and  was used to acquire an equity interest in fluorous technologies  inc during  we generated million from financing activities  consisting of cash generated of from the sale of common stock offset by  in payments on outstanding debt 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  we have available a million credit facility to supplement our liquidity needs 
there were no borrowings under this credit facility at december  we are pursuing the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
in february  we purchased american advanced organics  a provider of rapid scale up manufacturing services  for approximately million in cash and stock 
we may also be required to pay in the aggregate up to an additional  in cash to former american advanced organics stockholders in and based on the financial performance of this division 
subsequent to december    was paid to the former aao stockholders 
in june  we made an investment in fluorous technologies  inc  a newly formed company based in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
fluorous technologies has licensed from the university of pittsburgh several patents and pending patent applications for the use of fluorous organic chemistry technology for chemical synthesis  isolation and purification 
fluorous technologies was formed to capitalize on the potential of this technology for pharmaceutical drug discovery  agrochemical product development  and more environmentally friendly chemical manufacturing 
we invested  in fluorous technologies representing an initial ownership interest 
our ownership interest in fluorous technologies is expected to be diluted to less than as fluorous technologies issues additional common stock to fund its operations and development 
as a result of our investment  a proportionate share of fluorous technologies losses has been included in our consolidated financial results from date of formation 
in january  we acquired new chemical entities  inc of bothell  wa 
for million in cash and the assumption of million in outstanding debt 
nce possesses an extensive collection of over  diverse compounds and natural products extracts  which are integrated into nce s drug discovery efforts 
these samples are complemented by a chemofocus library composed of pure single compound samples of both natural products and natural product based compounds augmented by combinatorial chemistry and computational drug design 
nce sells or licenses these libraries  or subsets  to customers for high throughput screening and novel drug lead discovery 
the company also sells or licenses subscriptions to its proprietary databases and data mining technology 
during our board of directors approved a two for one split of our common stock 
the stock split entitled each stockholder of record at the close of business on august   to receive a stock dividend of one additional share for every share of our common stock held on that date 
the additional shares resulting from the stock split were distributed on august  recent accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
our current business strategy is not to use derivative instruments and we expect the adoption of sfas to have an immaterial impact on us 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
and  among other issues clarifies the following the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  we are in compliance with the provisions of fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest our excess cash in interest bearing investment grade securities that we hold for the duration of the term of the respective instrument 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments
