item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by its success in acquiring oil and gas properties and its ability to maintain or increase production through its exploitation and exploration activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices have also significantly affected the company s results 
the following table reflects the company s oil and gas production and its average oil and gas prices for the periods presented years ended december  production oil mbbls us    argentina    ecuador  bolivia canada total  a   gas mmcf us    argentina   bolivia    canada total    total mboe    average sales prices oil per bbl us b c argentina ecuador bolivia canada total b c gas per mcf us argentina bolivia

b reflects the impact of oil hedges which reduced the company s us and total average oil prices per bbl by and  respectively 
c reflects the impact of oil hedges which reduced the company s us and total average oil prices per bbl by cents and six cents  respectively 
average us oil prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in the nymex reference price for oil 
the company s argentina oil production is sold at west texas intermediate spot prices as quoted on the platt s crude oil marketwire approximately equal to the nymex reference price less a specified differential 
production from the company s block and block in ecuador is sold to various third party purchases at west texas intermediate spot prices less a specified differential 
the company experienced a percent increase in its average oil price in compared to as a result of opec s efforts to reduce the available supply of crude oil in the global markets along with increasing demand 
this increase continued in with the company experiencing a gain of percent in its average oil price over the average oil price 
the company participated in oil hedges covering mmbbls and mmbbls during and  respectively 
the impact of these hedges reduced the company s us average oil price for and by and cents to and per bbl  respectively  and its overall average oil price by and six cents to and per bbl  respectively 
the company was not a party to any oil hedges in the company s realized average oil price for before hedges was approximately percent of the nymex reference price compared to percent in and percent in average us gas prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in spot market prices  which may vary significantly by region 
the company s bolivia average gas price is tied to a long term contract under which the base price is adjusted for changes in specified fuel oil indexes 
during and the last half of  these fuel oil indexes increased in conjunction with the current higher oil price environment 
in argentina  the company s average gas price is primarily determined by the realized price of oil from its el huemul concession  however  this contract expires at the end of the company anticipates securing long term contracts for this gas during and it expects future gas prices to be at lower levels than the current contract 
the company s canada gas is generally sold at spot market prices as reflected by the aeco gas price index 
the company s total average gas price for was percent higher than s and was one percent higher than s 
the company has previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intends to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which it considers favorable 
the company has entered into various oil hedges swap agreements for a total of mmbbls of oil at a weighted average price of per bbl nymex reference price for calendar year for additional information  see business and properties marketing included elsewhere in this form k 
the company continues to monitor oil and gas prices and may enter into additional oil and gas hedges or swaps in the future 
relatively modest changes in either oil or gas prices significantly impact the company s results of operations and cash flow 
however  the impact of changes in the market prices for oil and gas on the company s average realized prices may be reduced from time to time based on the level of the company s hedging activities 
based on oil production  a change in the average oil price realized  before hedges  by the company of per bbl would result in a change in net income and cash flow before income taxes on an annual basis of approximately million and million  respectively 
a cent per mcf change in the average price realized  before hedges  by the company for gas would result in a change in net income and cash flow before income taxes on an annual basis of approximately million and million  respectively  based on gas production 
period to period comparison year ended december   compared to year ended december  the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the same period in a percent increase in average oil prices and a percent increase in average gas prices received by the company and a percent increase in production on a boe basis were primarily responsible for the significant increase in its net income 
oil and gas sales increased million percent  to million for from million for a percent increase in average oil prices combined with an percent increase in oil production accounted for an increase of million 
a percent increase in average gas prices  coupled with an percent increase in gas production  accounted for an additional increase of million 
the company had an percent increase in oil production primarily as a result of argentina production added through the acquisitions of the el huemul concession the el huemul acquisition and additional working interests in its two producing concessions in ecuador collectively  the acquisitions and the exploitation activities in argentina 
the company s gas production rose by percent due primarily to the gas production from the el huemul concession acquired in july and increased production in bolivia as a result of increased takes into the bolivia to brazil pipeline 
this increase more than offset the decline in us gas production as a result of the december sale of certain oil and gas properties located in northern california s sacramento basin area 
gains on disposition of assets of million million net of income taxes were reflected in as a result of million in proceeds from various oil and gas property divestitures in the united states 
other than the million in gains reported  the divestitures did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations as the majority of the divestitures occurred during december in  the company recorded a loss on the disposition of assets  primarily as a result of post closing adjustments on dispositions  of million 
as a result of an unfavorable decision by the supreme court of argentina  the company recorded as other expense in a non recurring charge of million million net of tax 
no similar charge existed in for further information regarding this litigation see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
lease operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million percent  to million for from million for the increase in lease operating expenses is due primarily the acquisitions and an increase in production taxes due to higher product prices 
lease operating expenses per equivalent barrel produced increased to in from for the same period in as the result of a securities and exchange commission mandate  transportation and storage costs billed to the company have been reclassified to lease operating expenses for all periods shown 
these costs had been previously reported as a reduction of oil and gas revenues consistent with oil and gas industry practice 
this reclassification added and to the reported lease operating expense per boe for the years and  respectively 
exploration costs increased million percent  to million for from million for during  the company s exploration costs included million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling and leasehold impairments associated with a much higher exploration capital budget and the drilling of an increased number of higher risk exploratory wells during the year  and million for seismic and other geological and geophysical costs 
due to reduced cash flow levels  the company significantly reduced its capital budget for exploration expenses for consisted of million for seismic data acquisition  million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling and million for lease impairments and other geological and geophysical costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to personnel additions in conjunction with increased capital expenditures  the acquisitions and the delay of annual compensation adjustments from january until august 
the company s g a per boe for was compared to for depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million percent  to million for from million for  despite a percent increase in total production due primarily to higher reserves resulting from higher product prices used throughout the year in the dd a calculation 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel produced decreased from in to in interest expense decreased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to a percent decrease in the company s total average outstanding debt due to the company s significant repayment of outstanding debt as a result of significantly increased cash flow and the million of cash proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in late the company s average interest rate for its outstanding debt for was percent compared to percent in year ended december   compared to year ended december  the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the same period in a percent increase in average oil prices received by the company was primarily responsible for the significant increase in its net income 
the company also recorded after tax gains on property sales of million in the company s net loss recorded in was primarily the result of historically low oil prices which greatly reduced revenues and led to an oil and gas property impairment of million million net of tax 
oil and gas sales increased million percent  to million for from million for a percent increase in average oil prices combined with a three percent increase in oil production  accounted for an increase of million 
a one percent increase in average gas prices  coupled with a two percent increase in gas production  accounted for an additional increase of million 
the company experienced a three percent increase in oil production primarily as a result of argentina production added through the el huemul acquisition which offset the decline in the company s us oil production primarily due to the shutting in of certain high cost properties during the first half of as a result of historically low oil prices 
the company s gas production rose by two percent due to the gas production attributable to the el huemul concession acquired in july which more than offset the decrease in us gas production resulting from the natural decline in the galveston bay field and the decrease in bolivia production due to limited gas demand from the developing export market in brazil 
gains on disposition of assets of million million net of income taxes were reflected in as a result of million in proceeds from various oil and gas property divestitures in the united states 
other than the million in gains reported  the divestitures did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations as the majority of the divestitures occurred during december the company also does not expect a significant impact on its continuing operations due to these divestitures as interest savings from the reduction in debt are expected to generally offset any future reduction in earnings 
lease operating expenses  including production taxes  decreased million percent  to million for from million for the decrease in lease operating expenses  despite the three percent increase in production  is due primarily to actions taken by the company to reduce costs including shutting in certain high cost properties  rebidding field service and product contracts and the reorganization of certain field operations 
lease operating expenses per equivalent barrel produced decreased to in from for the same period in exploration costs decreased million percent  to million for from million for during  the company s exploration costs included million for the acquisition of d seismic data primarily in the us gulf coast area and bolivia  million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling  and million for lease impairments and other geological and geophysical costs 
due to reduced cash flow levels  the company significantly reduced its capital budget for as a result  exploration expenses for consisted of only million for seismic data acquisition  million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling and million for lease impairments and other geological and geophysical costs 
impairments of oil and gas properties of million were recognized in  compared to million of impairments in  which resulted primarily from the decline in oil prices which took place in the last quarter of the impairments recorded in were primarily as a result of mechanical failures which were uneconomic to repair and unsuccessful development projects on various fields in the united states 
the company reviews its proved properties for impairment on a field basis and recognizes an impairment whenever events or circumstances such as declining oil and gas prices or unsuccessful development projects indicate that the properties carrying value may not be recoverable 
if an impairment is indicated based on the company s estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves on a field basis  then a provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the present value of the estimated future net revenues fair value 
in estimating the future net revenues  the company assumed that the current oil price environment would return to more historical levels over a short period of time and thereafter escalate annually 
the company assumed gas prices and operating costs would escalate annually beginning at current levels 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is possible that the company s assumptions regarding oil and gas prices may change in the future and may result in future impairment provisions 
general and administrative expenses increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to the accrual of employee incentive bonuses and approximately million in costs associated with the company s efforts to prepare for yk 
the company implemented a bonus program effective for covering all us employees designed to provide additional incentive to achieve certain corporate goals 
the company s g a per boe for was before the bonus accrual compared to for depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million percent  to million for from million for  despite the three percent increase in total production due primarily to a lower dd a rate per equivalent barrel for versus the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel produced decreased from in to in primarily as a result of the impact of the new production from the company s el huemul concession which has a substantially lower amortization rate and the effect of the us impairments in interest expense increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to a percent increase in the company s total average outstanding debt as a result of the company s total capital spending  including acquisitions  exceeding s cash flow and an increase in its average interest rate on its outstanding debt 
the company s average interest rate for its outstanding debt for was percent compared to percent in capital expenditures during  the company s total oil and gas capital expenditures were million 
in north america  the company s non acquisition oil and gas capital expenditures totaled million 
exploration activities accounted for million of the north america capital expenditures with exploitation activities contributing million 
during  the company s international non acquisition oil and gas capital expenditures totaled million  consisting of million in argentina on exploitation activities  million in bolivia on exploitation and exploration activities  and million in yemen and ecuador  principally on exploration 
total acquisition capital expenditures for of million included million for the acquisition of the cuyo basin concession in argentina and million allocated to proved properties as part of the acquisition of percent of the outstanding common stock of cometra energy canada  ltd  a privately held canadian company 
as of december   the company had total unevaluated oil and gas property costs of approximately million consisting of undeveloped leasehold costs of million and exploratory drilling in progress of million 
approximately million of the unevaluated costs are associated with the company s yemen drilling program 
future exploration expense and earnings may be impacted to the extent any of the exploratory drilling is determined to be unsuccessful 
the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary with no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company uses internally generated cash flow to fund capital expenditures other than significant acquisitions 
of the company s non acquisition capital expenditures of million  approximately percent was spent on exploitation activities  including development and infill drilling  and approximately percent was spent on exploration activities  a part of which satisfied all of the company s previous exploration commitments in bolivia  ecuador and yemen 
the company s preliminary capital expenditure budget for is currently set at million  exclusive of acquisitions 
the company does not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast 
the company is actively pursuing additional acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
in addition to internally generated cash flow and advances under its revolving credit facility  the company may seek additional sources of capital to fund any future significant acquisitions see liquidity  however  no assurance can be given that sufficient funds will be available to fund the company s desired acquisitions 
the company s recent capital expenditure history is as follows years ended december  in thousands acquisition of oil and gas reserves    drilling    acquisition of undeveloped acreage and seismic    workovers and recompletions    acquisition and construction of gathering systems  other  total    liquidity internally generated cash flow and the borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility are the company s major sources of liquidity 
in addition  the company may use other sources of capital  including the issuance of additional debt securities or equity securities  to fund any major acquisitions it might secure in the future and to maintain its financial flexibility 
in the past  the company has accessed the public markets to finance significant acquisitions and provide liquidity for its future activities 
prior to in conjunction with the purchase of substantial oil and gas assets  the company completed four public equity offerings as well as two public debt offerings  which provided the company with aggregate net proceeds of million 
on january   the company issued million of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after february  in addition  prior to february   the company may redeem up to of the notes with the proceeds of certain underwritten public offerings of the company s common stock 
the notes mature on june   with interest payable semiannually on june and december of each year 
the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the notes approximately million were used to repay a portion of the existing indebtedness under the company s revolving credit facility 
on june   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  all of which were sold by the company 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to partially fund the purchase of the el huemul concession from total and repsol in early july also in july  in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of a portion of the over allotment option  the company sold an additional  shares of common stock using the additional million of net proceeds to reduce a portion of the company s existing indebtedness under its revolving credit facility 
under the second amended and restated credit agreement dated november   the bank facility  certain banks have provided to the company an unsecured revolving credit facility 
the bank facility establishes a borrowing base currently million determined by the banks evaluation of the company s oil and gas reserves 
the amount available to be borrowed under the bank facility is limited to the lesser of the borrowing base or the facility size  which is currently set at million 
outstanding advances under the bank facility bear interest payable quarterly at a floating rate based on bank of montreal s alternate base rate as defined or  at the company s option  at a fixed rate for up to six months based on the eurodollar market rate libor 
the company s interest rate increments above the alternate base rate and libor vary based on the level of outstanding senior debt to the borrowing base 
as of february   the company had elected a fixed rate based on libor for a substantial portion of its outstanding advances  which resulted in an average interest rate of approximately percent per annum 
in addition  the company must pay a commitment fee ranging from to percent per annum on the unused portion of the banks commitment 
on a semiannual basis  the company s borrowing base is redetermined by the banks based upon their review of the company s oil and gas reserves 
if the sum of outstanding senior debt exceeds the borrowing base  as redetermined  the company must repay such excess 
final maturity of the bank facility is november at february   the unused portion of the bank facility was approximately million 
the unused portion of the bank facility and the company s internally generated cash flow provide liquidity which may be used to finance future capital expenditures  including acquisitions 
as additional acquisitions are made and such properties are added to the borrowing base  the banks determination of the borrowing base and their commitments may be increased 
the company s internally generated cash flow  results of operations and financing for its operations are dependent on oil and gas prices 
for  approximately percent of the company s production was oil 
realized oil prices for the year increased by percent as compared to and total production on a boe basis increased by percent 
as a result  the company s earnings and cash flows have been materially increased compared to to the extent oil prices decline  the company s earnings and cash flow from operations may be adversely impacted 
however  the company believes that its cash flows and unused availability under the bank facility are sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
inflation in recent years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations or financial condition 
income taxes the company incurred a current provision for income taxes of approximately million and million for and  respectively  and realized a current benefit of million for the total provision for us income taxes is based on the federal corporate statutory income tax rate plus an estimated average rate for state income taxes 
earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign income taxes 
no us deferred tax liability will be recognized related to the unremitted earnings of these foreign subsidiaries as it is the company s intention  generally  to reinvest such earnings permanently 
the company has an estimated us federal alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward of approximately million at december   which does not expire and is available to offset us federal regular income taxes in future years  but only to the extent that us federal regular income taxes exceed the amt in such years 
the company fully utilized its million us federal regular tax net operating loss nol carryforward and its amt credit carryforward in the company has a bolivian income tax nol of approximately million which does not expire and can be used to offset future bolivian tax liabilities of the company

the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells crude oil  natural gas  condensate  natural gas liquids and sulfur 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
the company has previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intends to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which it considers favorable 
during  the company entered into various oil hedges swap agreements for a total of mmbbls of oil at a weighted average price of per bbl nymex reference price for the fair value of commodity swap agreements is the amount at which they could be settled  based on quoted market prices 
at december   the company would have received approximately  to terminate its oil swap agreements then in place 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into additional oil hedging contracts through december   covering an additional mmbbls of oil and a weighted average nymex reference price of per bbl 
the company also entered into additional oil hedging contracts covering mmbbls for various periods during in total  the company entered into oil hedging contracts covering production of mmbbls of oil at a weighted average nymex reference price of per bbl 
during  the company entered into various oil hedges swap agreements for a total of mmbbls of oil at a weighted average nymex reference price of per bbl for the calendar year at december   the company would have received approximately million to terminate its oil swap agreements then in place 
the company continues to monitor oil and gas prices and may enter into additional oil and gas hedges or swaps in the future 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk exposure results primarily from short term rates  mainly libor based borrowings from its commercial banks 
to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains a portion of its total debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
at december   the amount of the company s fixed rate debt was approximately percent of total debt 
in the past  the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner

foreign currency and operations risk international investments represent  and are expected to continue to represent  a significant portion of the company s total assets 
the company has international operations in argentina  bolivia  ecuador  canada and yemen 
for  the company s operations in argentina accounted for approximately percent of the company s revenues  percent of the company s operating income before impairments of oil and gas properties and percent of its total assets 
during  the company s operations in argentina represented its only foreign operations accounting for more than percent of its revenues or operating income before impairments of oil and gas properties or total assets 
the company continues to identify and evaluate international opportunities but currently has no binding agreements or commitments to make any material international investment 
as a result of such significant foreign operations  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions or changes in the political climate in these foreign countries 
the company believes argentina offers a relatively stable political environment and does not anticipate any significant change in the near future 
the current democratic form of government has been in place since and  since  has pursued a steady process of privatization  deregulation and economic stabilization and reforms involving the reduction of inflation and public spending 
all of the company s argentine revenues are us dollar based  while a large portion of its costs are denominated in argentine pesos 
the argentina central bank is obligated by law to sell dollars at a rate of one argentine peso to one us dollar and has sought to prevent appreciation of the peso by buying dollars at rates of not less than peso to one us dollar 
as a result  the company believes that should any devaluation of the argentine peso occur  its revenues would be unaffected and its operating costs would not be significantly increased 
at the present time  there are no foreign exchange controls preventing or restricting the conversion of argentine pesos into dollars 
since the mid s  bolivia has been undergoing major economic reform  including the establishment of a free market economy and the encouragement of foreign private investment 
economic activities that had been reserved for government corporations were opened to foreign and domestic private investments 
barriers to international trade have been reduced and tariffs lowered 
a new investment law and revised codes for mining and the petroleum industry  intended to attract foreign investment  have been introduced

the us bs exchange rate at december   was us bs 
the company believes that any currency risk associated with its bolivian operations would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the new administration in ecuador  led by president gustavo naboa  is undertaking a broad based program of economic reform to stem the decline in economic activity and to lay the basis for renewed economic growth 
the legal basis for many of the reforms is the ley fundamental para la transformacion economica del ecuador the economic transformation law enacted in march  which mandated dollarization of the economy 
as a result of this reform  all of the company s ecuadorian revenues and costs are us dollar based 
president naboa continues to seek majority support and to overcome legal challenges necessary for the second phase of the economic transformation law known as trole ii  which would bring significant tax and labor reform and a defined privatization program to increase inflows of foreign direct investment 
with the cometra acquisition in december  the company now has producing operations in canada 
the company views the operating environment in canada as stable and the economic stability as good
