item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview privatebancorp was organized as a delaware corporation in to serve as the holding company for a chicago based de novo start up bank 
our flagship downtown chicago location opened in we expanded to wilmette in north suburban cook county in and the oak brook facility in west suburban dupage county was established in we established the st 
charles office in january  in connection with our purchase of towne square financial corporation a company which was in the process of forming a de novo  or start up bank on august  on february   we consummated our acquisition of johnson bank illinois adding two additional locations of the privatebank chicago in lake forest and winnetka  illinois 
during the second quarter  we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on june   privatebancorp capitalized the privatebank st 
louis 
since year end to december   we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of to million 
during the same period  loans have grown at a compound annual rate of to million  deposits at a compound annual rate of to million and trust assets under administration at a compound annual rate of to million 
for financial information regarding our four separate lines of business  the privatebank chicago  the privatebank st 
louis  trust services and holding company activities  see note operating segments to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included on page f the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of trust fee income  and to a lesser extent  net securities gains and fees for ancillary banking services 
non interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels 
this is largely the result of the profile of our typical client 
our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks 
because average balances tend to be high  we do not earn high service charge income typical of many retail banks 
non interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations 
our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories 
profitability and expense ratios were negatively impacted in due to the start up operation of the st 
charles office  the acquisition of johnson bank illinois  and the opening of the privatebank st 
louis 
during  we expect to continue to incur operating expenses in excess of revenues for the privatebank st 
louis 
on june   we sold  shares of common stock in our initial public offering at per share 
the closing date of the offering was july   when we received net proceeds of approximately million after deduction of offering expenses 
on july   an additional  shares were sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option for additional net proceeds of million 
the year to date earnings per share calculation as of december  does not equal the sum of the individual quarter earnings per share amounts 
based upon the application of fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  a difference arises that is attributable to the impact of our initial public offering which closed in july  and the acquisition of town square financial corporation during the third quarter consolidated results of operations net income our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  excluding one time charges  our earnings were million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in net income for the year ended december  included a previously announced one time charge of  after tax  or per diluted share  comprised of severance packages for two departing executives as well as amounts incurred to secure their replacements 
net income for the year ended december   included an acquisition charge of million after tax  or per diluted share  related to the acquisition of towne square financial corporation in st 
charles  illinois and the start up expenses of the privatebank st 
louis 
the earnings growth of between and is due to growth in net interest income and non interest income offset by higher operating expenses 
net income in includes the financial results of the former johnson bank illinois locations subsequent to their acquisition on february  excluding the effects of goodwill amortization and acquisition interest expense associated with the transaction  the two offices located in winnetka and lake forest have contributed million to our net income in net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  excluding the towne square financial corporation acquisition related charge and st 
louis start up costs  earnings were million  an increase of over net income 
before these one time charges  earnings per diluted share were  a increase over earnings per diluted share of 
the increase in earnings from operations before one time charges is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet  particularly in loans  and improvement in our net interest margin 
increased fee income  mainly from trust services  also contributed to the improvement in income before one time charges

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
interest income includes loan origination fees recorded from loans 
the volume of non interest bearing funds  largely comprised of demand deposits and capital  also affects the net interest margin 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets 
average earning assets for were million compared to million for  an increase of 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
although the rising interest rate environment which was in effect during the first six months of had the effect of improving the yield on average earning assets during as compared to  the rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds also increased in as compared to  resulting in reduced net interest spread for as compared to the decrease in net interest margin is primarily attributable to an increase in borrowed funds utilized to complete the johnson bank illinois acquisition and to capitalize the privatebank st 
louis 
the effect of non interest bearing deposits added basis points to net interest margin 
we expect that we will likely experience margin pressure during if we continue to experience a falling interest rate environment during as interest rates decline  the portion of our loan portfolio that is based on floating rates will re price downward 
likewise  our deposits and floating rate borrowings will re price downward as well 
however  effective february   we increased our fixed rate borrowings through the issuance of million trust preferred securities 
these securities are accounted for as long term debt and pay interest at the fixed rate of 
the effect of the trust preferred issuance will be to compress interest margin in a falling interest rate environment 
net interest income was million during the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets and  to a lesser extent  improvement in net interest spread 
average earning assets during were million compared to million for  an increase of 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in net interest margin was attributable to a favorable shift in the mix of earning assets resulting in a higher percentage of average loans to total average assets and to the benefit in of investing the proceeds of our initial public offering in interest earning assets 
in  the effect of non interest bearing funds on the net interest margin added basis points to the margin

the provision for loan losses reflects management s latest assessment of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for probable loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the reserve 
our analysis is influenced by the following factors the volume and quality of loans and commitments in the portfolio  loss experience  and economic conditions 
a discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based begins on page our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in net charge offs for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
our provision for loan loss was  in and we recognized  of net charge offs during non interest income non interest income increased approximately million or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to increases in service charge income and trust fee revenues 
banking service charge income increased by  over the prior year due primarily to fees earned on accounts related to the former johnson bank illinois offices in winnetka and lake forest 
trust fee revenue increased to million in compared to million in trust assets under administration increased to million at year end  compared to million at december  in february  the acquisition of johnson bank illinois added approximately million to trust assets under administration

excluding one time charges  non interest expense increased from million during to million during a portion of the increase is attributable to goodwill amortization of  recorded during resulting from the johnson bank illinois acquisition  which closed on february  the remainder of the increase over the prior year level is also primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with our expansion initiatives 
non interest expense for the year ended december  includes operating expenses of million and million related to the st 
charles and the st 
louis offices  respectively 
additionally  results reflect the addition of the two new locations acquired through the johnson bank illinois transaction which increased operating expenses by million for the year ended december  in addition to the  of goodwill amortization recognized during in connection with the acquisition 
the remaining increase in non interest expense of approximately million is due to overall growth in salaries and benefits  professional services and marketing costs at our existing offices 
included in total non interest expense for the year ended december   is the one time million charge associated with the acquisition of towne square financial corporation  as well as  of transaction costs associated with the acquisition

salary and employee benefit expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  full time equivalent employees increased to at december  from at december  the increase in salary and benefits is due primarily to an increased number of employees  including the senior officers  responsible for opening the st

our main office in chicago has also experienced growth in personnel during in response to the overall growth of the organization and to increased staffing needs to support a public company 
salary and employee benefit expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  full time equivalent employees increased to at december  from at december  the increase in salary and benefits for was affected by the start up of the st 
charles office 
in addition  we incurred approximately  in salary related expense in connection with the formation of the st

a portion of the increase in salaries and benefits is attributable to a general increase in our staffing resulting from growth and increased staffing needs to support a public company 
professional fees  which include legal  accounting  consulting services and investment management fees  increased to million for the year ended december  from for the increase in is primarily due to higher legal  accounting and information system consultation services

the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses

during  we increased our utilization of federal home loan bank advances to fund loan growth 
management anticipates that our reliance on federal home loan bank borrowings as a funding source will likely remain at current levels in to the extent that rates on federal home loan bank advances continue to be more attractive than deposit pricing

the initial rate of interest on the subordinated note was and reset to on february  on february   we issued million in trust preferred securities at a fixed rate of which mature on december  at our option  the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity on or after december  the trust preferred securities will be presented in our consolidated balance sheet as long term debt trust preferred securities 
upon receipt of the net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses and including the underwriters over allotment shares  we repaid the full amount of borrowings under our revolving line of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of million 
as of march   borrowings under the revolving line of credit were and the maximum amount available under the line of credit is million 
capital resources stockholders equity at december  rose to million  an increase of million from the year end level of million  due primarily to the increase in net income from the year ended december  as well as the change in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale net of tax 
during july  we raised approximately million in capital net of commissions and offering costs through the issuance of  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering 
we are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors  and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas 
failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
if a banking subsidiary is not well capitalized  regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits 
if undercapitalized  capital distributions are limited as is asset growth and expansion and plans for capital restoration are required 
the following table reflects various consolidated measures of our capital at december  and december  pro forma leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio total equity to total assets the pro forma ratios presented for in the table above reflect the impact of the issuance of million of trust preferred securities assuming the issuance had occurred on december  as of such date  the trust preferred securities would have been included in tier capital in the amount of million 
the tier qualifying amount is limited to of tier capital under federal reserve regulations 
the excess amount of million pro forma as of december  qualifies as tier capital 
the subordinated note in the amount of million which was issued to johnson international as consideration in connection with the johnson bank illinois acquisition qualifies as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
to be considered well capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
to be adequately capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at december   we continued to exceed the minimum levels of all regulatory capital requirements  and were considered adequately capitalized under regulatory standards 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio was 
with the exception of the total risk based capital ratio  we exceeded the well capitalized levels of our regulatory capital requirements 
at december   the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis were considered well capitalized under all applicable regulatory standards  including total risk based capital ratio 
liquidity liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for our clients credit needs 
our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities  investment in and maturity of assets  changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets 
liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost 
liquidity management is guided by policies  formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments 
our principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital contributions by privatebancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital 
our core deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits 
core deposits are defined to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds 
time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
over the past several years  our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short 
we expect these short term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place 
in the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank  unless those deposits are replaced with traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowed money or capital  we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs 
we have continued to use federal home loan bank advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding loan growth 
during  we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand and year contingency planning 
during we expanded our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of the privatebank chicago 
during we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits together with increased federal home loan bank advances as alternative methods of funding loan growth 
we will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources  but plan to supplement our funding needs with non traditional funding sources as needed 
we anticipate that our average cost of funds will increase in compared to due to the increased reliance on non traditional funding sources 
we expect that the privatebank st 
louis will begin to purchase brokered deposits in as well  in the absence of traditional deposit growth sufficient to fund the expected loan growth in that market 
liquid assets refers to money market assets such as federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds 
at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank chicago were million as compared to million at december  at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank st 
louis were million 
net cash inflows provided by operations were million for the year ended december  compared to a net inflow of million a year earlier 
net cash outflows from investing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to a net cash outflow of million a year earlier 
cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to a net inflow of million in in the event of short term liquidity needs  the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
we measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured the assets and liabilities of our company to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
our policy states that we shall maintain a gap position at the one year horizon of between and 
our position at december  was and was within the guidelines of our policy 
we have continued to maintain our gap position near the low end set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent 
therefore  generally speaking  a short term rise in interest rates will hurt our earnings  while a short term drop in interest rates would help our earnings 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors which are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement 
for example  a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage related investments to prepay more quickly than projected 
this could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped 
conversely  a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage related loans which would increase our returns

december  december  basis basis basis basis points points points points percentage change in net interest income due to an immediate basis point change in interest rates over a two year time horizon this table shows that if there was an instantaneous  parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points  we would suffer a decline in net interest income of and over a two year horizon based on our earning asset portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
conversely  a like shift of basis points would increase net interest income by over a two year horizon based on december  balances  down slightly from the measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
changes in the effect on net interest income from a basis point movement at december  as compared to december  are relatively similar because of the timing of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities 
in each period  the increase in interest income in the reduced rate environment and the decrease in interest income in an increased rate environment is due to our negatively gapped balance sheet within a two year horizon 
in a rates down basis points scenario  rate sensitive liabilities would reprice to reduced rates more quickly than many rate sensitive assets  resulting in higher net interest income 
the percentage increase in a rates down scenario is less at december  than at december  because the percentage of our assets that would prepay in rates down has increased between years 
in addition  we increased our term borrowings and brokered deposits during these additional sources of funding mature or reprice within one month to five years 
the rate shock simulation over a two year horizon does not reflect the issuance of million of trust preferred securities which we completed on february  at a fixed rate of 
in a rates down scenario  the fixed rate trust preferred securities will negatively impact net interest income as these securities are fixed rate in nature 
the increased loss in a rates up basis points environment at december  compared to december  is due to the addition of fixed rate assets and liabilities from the johnson bank acquisition 
these fixed rate liabilities reprice faster than the assets  increasing the compression on our margin 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
