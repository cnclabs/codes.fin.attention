the agreement provides for milestone payments and royalties based on net sales in the united states 
the company expects royalty payments under this agreement to expire in march redux see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements the company entered into the ahp indemnity and release agreement on may  pursuant to which ahp agreed to indemnify the company against certain classes of product liability cases filed against interneuron related to redux 
the company s indemnification covers existing plaintiffs who have already opted out of ahp s national class action settlement of diet drug claims and claimants alleging primary pulmonary hypertension 
in addition  ahp has agreed to fund all future legal costs related to the company s defense of redux related product liability cases 
the agreement also provides for ahp to fund additional insurance coverage to supplement the company s existing product liability insurance 
the company believes this total insurance coverage is sufficient to address its potential remaining redux product liability exposure 
however  there can be no assurance that uninsured or insufficiently insured redux related claims or redux related claims for which the company is not otherwise indemnified or covered under the ahp indemnity and release agreement will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future business  results of operations or financial condition or that the potential of any such claims would not adversely affect the company s ability to obtain sufficient financing to fund operations 
up to the date of the ahp indemnity and release agreement  the company s defense costs were paid by  or subject to reimbursement to the company from  the company s product liability insurers 
to date  there have been no redux related product liability settlements or judgments paid by the company or its insurers 
in exchange for the indemnification  defense costs  and insurance coverage provided to interneuron by ahp  the company agreed to dismiss its suit against ahp filed in january  its appeal from the order approving ahp s national class action settlement of diet drug claims  and its cross claims against ahp related to redux product liability legal actions 
as a result of the ahp indemnity and release agreement  the company believes that it is no longer probable that it will have to pay approximately  for estimated liabilities that had been established at the time redux was withdrawn 
accordingly  the company has reversed these accruals in the year ended september  and has reflected the reversal as a credit in product withdrawal in the company s statement of operations 
in january  the company was reimbursed  for litigation expenses previously paid by the company and for other redux related costs 
of this amount   of other redux related costs are included as a credit in the company s statement of operations for the year ended september  under product withdrawal

in october  the commonwealth court of pennsylvania granted an order of liquidation to the insurance commissioner of pennsylvania to begin liquidation proceedings against reliance 
based upon discussions with its attorneys and other consultants regarding the amount and timing of potential collection of its claims on reliance  the company has recorded a reserve against its outstanding and estimated claim receivable from reliance to reduce the balance to the estimated net realizable value of  this reserve of  is recorded in product withdrawal and reflects the company s best estimate given the available facts and circumstances 
the amount the company collects could differ from the  reflected as a noncurrent insurance claim receivable at september  there can be no assurance that the company will collect any of its  of estimated claims 
if the company incurs additional product liability defense and other costs subject to claims on the reliance product liability policy up to the  limit of the policy  the company will have to pay such costs without expectation of reimbursement and will incur charges to operations for all or a portion of such payments 
in october  the district court returned  to the company from the initial payment the company made to the district court pursuant to a proposed redux related settlement which was rejected by the district court 
the company reflected this amount at september  as a receivable and a credit in product withdrawal for the year ended september  the product withdrawal net credit of  for the year ended september  consisted of credits of approximately  for redux related accruals reversed in fiscal and  for insurance reimbursements of other redux related expenses  partially offset by the  reserve for the insurance claim on reliance and the noncash charge of  for the fair value of stock options granted to attorneys involved in the ahp litigation 
on august   columbia casualty company  one of the company s insurers for the period of may through may  filed an action in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the company 
the lawsuit is based upon a claim for breach of contract and declaratory judgment  seeking damages against the company in excess of  the amount that the plaintiff has paid to the company under its insurance policy 
the plaintiff alleges that under the policy it was subrogated to any claim for indemnification that interneuron may have had against ahp related to redux and that such claim was compromised without its consent when the company entered into the ahp indemnity and release agreement 
the company plans to vigorously defend this litigation
