item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of december  and however  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us and european interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and european interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and available for sale securities as well as interest paid on debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities and bonds of million and short term borrowings of million  all subject to variable short term interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate of for example from to would not have a material effect on the company s earnings for the year ended december  the company has lines of credit and other debt whose interest rates are based on various published prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk  and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates foreign subsidiaries in canada  italy  the united kingdom  germany  france  the netherlands  china and the czech republic 
the company s business and financial condition are  therefore  sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies 
sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates during the period 
the company does not employ any derivative based hedging strategies  however  it may do so in the future 
the company also has a significant natural hedge in the form of italian based manufacturing and european based operating  interest and tax expenses 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar  the company s functional currency  relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business 
all other things being equal  an average increase in the value of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of reducing net income approximately million
