overview i sector corporation i sector  formerly allstar systems  inc  has historically been engaged in the business of providing its customers with solutions to their information and communications technology needs 
through  our revenue was historically derived through four primary areas of business  it services  cti software  computer products and telecom systems  each of which were historically been reported as a separate segment 
during the year ended december  we discontinued our telecom systems business and during the quarter ended march  we discontinued our computer products business 
we sold both telecom systems and computer products businesses in separate transactions during the first quarter of after the sale of these two businesses  in july  we separated what had been the it services business into three separate businesses  each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary corporation 
one of these subsidiary companies is it staffing  inc it staffing  which had already been operated as a wholly owned subsidiary 
we contributed the remaining components of the former it services business to two newly formed wholly owned corporations  allstar computer services  inc acs and synergy helpdesk solutions  inc synergy 
in july  we formed another wholly owned subsidiary  internetworking sciences  inc inx  a professional services organization that focuses on the design  deployment and support of large scale network infrastructure requirements 
in october inx acquired certain assets of an unrelated professional service company in the dallas area  which had a similar focus  and subsequently underwent a legal name change to internetwork experts  inc our cti software business was not affected by the sale of the computer products and telecom systems business units  however we are now referring to this segment by its corporate name  stratasoft rather than cti software as we have in the past 
we market our services businesses in texas from locations in the houston and dallas fort worth metropolitan areas 
stratasoft markets its products worldwide through a direct sales force and an authorized dealer network 
by operating through these highly focused wholly owned subsidiaries  we believe that we will offer better customer service  and improve our financial performance 
during the year ended december   acs  synergy  inx and it staffing produced   and of total revenues  while stratasoft produced of total revenues 
gross margin varies substantially between each of these business segments 
over the past three years gross margin in the previously existing  but continuing  service businesses has ranged between and and gross margin for stratasoft has ranged between to 
on march  we entered into an agreement whereby we agreed to sell the ongoing business operations of our computer products business  together with certain key assets of our it services business located in el paso  texas 
under the terms of the sale we received for the sale of the operations of the computer products business cash consideration of  plus the possibility of receiving a future payment of up to from an escrow account 
a gain on disposal of the computer products business  including an estimate of the operating results from the measurement date  march   to the closing date of the sale  may   of  and estimates for impairment of assets caused by the disposal decision of  totaling  net of taxes of  has been recognized in the year ended december  our income from discontinued operations of the computer products business was and  and net of taxes of and and in  and  respectively 
we retained accounts receivable related to the computer products business of  net of reserves  fixed assets of and liabilities related to the computer products business 
the accounts receivable collected were used to repay all remaining liabilities of the computer products division 
fixed assets were redeployed in the continuing operations 
the sale of computer products closed on may   after shareholder and other required consents were obtained 
on november   we approved a plan to sell or close our telecom systems division 
the sale was finalized on march  under the terms of the sale we received for the sale of the inventory and operations of telecom systems cash 
additionally  the purchaser assumed all of our telephone equipment warranty obligations up to a maximum of  which was reached in october all future warranty costs incurred by the purchaser will be billed to us at an agreed upon rate 
an estimate of the cost of future telephone equipment warranty obligations of is included at december  in the balance sheet caption net liabilities related to discontinued operations 
a disposal loss  including an estimate of the operating results from the measurement date  november  to the closing date of the sale of  and estimates for impairment of assets caused by the disposal decision of  totaling  net of an income tax saving of was recognized 
our loss from discontinued operations net of income tax savings of and was and in and  respectively 
we retained accounts receivable of million  net of reserves  fixed assets of and liabilities related to the telecom division 
accounts receivable  net of reserves  is at december  fixed assets were redeployed in the continuing operations 
the accounts receivable collected were used to repay all remaining liabilities of the telecom division 
a significant portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses relate to personnel costs  some of which are variable and others of which are relatively fixed 
our variable personnel costs are substantially comprised of sales commissions  which are typically calculated based upon our gross profit on a particular sales transaction and thus generally fluctuate with our overall gross profit 
the remainder of our selling  general and administrative expenses are relatively more fixed and  while still somewhat variable  do not vary with increases in revenue as directly as do sales commissions 
we account for wages and related taxes and employee benefits paid to technical staff as a cost of service provided and therefore such costs are a component of cost of goods sold  gross profit and gross margin 
as a certain component of total technical staff wages and related costs are of a fixed nature  gross margin will vary to the extent that revenues fluctuate from period to period

inx gross loss was for a gross margin rate of 
since inx was formed in july   there is no history for comparison 
as a newly formed start up operation  inx had to have billable technical staff in place in order to be able to market their services  but was unable to utilize that technical staff sufficiently to cover their labor cost 
it staffing gross profit decreased by to in compared to in gross margin rates for it staffing were in as compared to in the decrease in gross margin percentages was primarily due to a contract with a major customer which limits the billable rates for that particular customer  which more than offset a positive impact related to higher levels of higher margin placement fees for permanent placements as compared to the year earlier period 
the gross profit for stratasoft increased by to  in from  in gross margin rates for stratasoft were in as compared to in the decreased gross margin was primarily due to inventory markdowns along with increased travel costs for technical staff traveling nationally and internationally for project installations 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by the mix of sales with a higher proportion of total systems sales  which include a hardware component  as compared to software only sales  which do not have a hardware cost of goods component 
the lower gross margin rates were offset by volume increases due primarily to higher revenues in  thereby producing increased gross profit

we have invested our excess cash in interest bearing overnight deposits 
our working capital was   and  at december   and  respectively 
the increase in working capital during is primarily due to the collection of receivables related to the discontinued operations of the computer products and the telecom businesses

during  and we used  and  respectively to repurchase shares that were held in treasury at the end of asset management our cash flow from operations has been affected primarily by the timing of our collection of accounts receivable 
we have typically sold our products and services on short term credit terms and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
we had accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  including  and relating to discontinued operations at december  and  respectively we attempt to manage our inventory in order to minimize the amount of inventory held for resale and the risk of inventory obsolescence and decreases in market value 
we attempt to maintain a level of inventory required to reach only our near term requirements by relying on the ready availability of products from our principal suppliers 
credit facilities on february  we entered into a credit agreement with deutsche financial services dfs for a revolving line of credit the dfs facility which is our principal source of liquidity

the agreement contains restrictive covenants which  among other things  require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
the terms of the agreement also prohibit the payment of dividends and limit the purchase of our common stock  and other similar expenditures  including advances to related parties 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended was adopted on january  the company has no derivative instruments as defined by sfas no 
and as a result the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we incur certain market risks related to interest rate variations because we hold floating rate debt 
based upon the average amount of debt outstanding during  a one percent increase in interest rates paid by us on our debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately for the year
