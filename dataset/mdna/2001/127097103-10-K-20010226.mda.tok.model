item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
please read forward looking information on page we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development 
overview our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
from the third quarter of through the first quarter of  we experienced a decline in energy commodity prices  resulting in lower revenues and net income during this period 
however  in the summer of and continuing into early  prices improved 
for the months of april through october  we had certain natural gas hedges in place that prevented us from realizing the full impact of this price environment 
see the commodity price swaps and options discussion on page despite this limitation  our realized natural gas price for each month in the year was higher than the same month of any previous year 
in the final months of  the nymex futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices 
we benefited from this market with our realized natural gas price reaching per mcf in december 
we reported earnings of per share  or million  for this is up from the per share  or million  reported in the improvement is a result of the stronger commodity price environment during the year  with our realized natural gas price up to per mcf and our crude oil price up to per bbl 
a discussion of our results from recurring operations can be found in the results of operations section  beginning on page before taking into account selected non recurring items  net income for was million  or per share  and million  or per share for we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells and an success rate in total capital expenditures were million for compared to million in most of the million increase was spent on drilling  with the largest activity increase coming in the gulf coast region  where we continued to develop the etouffee  bon ton  augen and krescent prospects in south louisiana 
we increased our spending for seismic data  both d and d  in order to evaluate our drilling opportunities for and beyond 
additionally  a portion of our capital budget in was spent to construct production facilities for use with several wells in south louisiana 
total equivalent production for was bcfe  a decrease of over production delays on non operated properties in the gulf coast region combined with the sale of non strategic properties in appalachia in the fourth quarter of accounted for much of this decline 
by the fourth quarter  this gulf coast production was on line and we exited the year producing approximately mmcfe per day 
due to the increased demand for drilling rigs and crews  some short drilling delays are anticipated in early however  whenever possible  we have contracted rigs and crews to begin working on our drilling program 
during  we improved our debt to equity ratio from at the end of to at the close of this improvement was a result of several significant accomplishments 
we sold million shares of common stock in may for net proceeds of million  of which million was used to repurchase all of our preferred stock 
the remaining proceeds  along with another million from employee stock option exercises  were used to reduce debt and pay dividends 
from year end to year end  we reduced debt by million 
we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit  concentrating on the highest expected return opportunities  and from synergistic acquisitions 
we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment  enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the price of oil and natural gas and our ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
however  in the summer of  our realized gas prices began to climb and by the fourth quarter of  we were realizing the highest prices in the company s history 
the primary sources of cash for us during were funds generated from operations and proceeds from the sale of stock 
funds were used primarily for exploration and development expenditures  the repurchase of the preferred stock  dividend payments and the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility 
we had net cash inflows of million during the net cash inflow from operating activities of million substantially offsets the million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures 
the cash proceeds from sale of common stock of million effectively funded the repurchase of the preferred stock  debt reduction and dividend payments 
in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were million higher than in this improvement was primarily a result of increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million higher than in this improvement was a result of increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and the proceeds from the buyout of the long term gas sales contract 
partially offsetting this benefit was the less favorable change in the balance sheet as we reduced the balance in accounts payable between year ends 
in millions cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by investing activities in were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
cash flows used by investing activities in were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
cash flows used by investing activities in were substantially attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties 
these expenditures included 
million used to purchase south louisiana properties from oryx in december 

million spent as part of the joint exploration agreement with union pacific resources 

million used to acquire bcfe of proved reserves in the western region 
in millions cash flows provided used by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities in included million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock  both in a block trade and through the exercise of employee stock options 
of the proceeds  million was used to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
additional cash used in financing activities included million used to reduce the year end debt balance to million from million in and cash used to pay dividends to stockholders 
cash flows used by financing activities in included million used to reduce the year end debt balance to million from million in and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders 
cash flows provided by financing activities in were increases in borrowings on the revolving credit facility used to fund investing activities such as the drilling program and the million in property acquisitions 
financing activities in also included the payment of dividends and the purchase of shares in the open market under our share repurchase program 
the purchased shares are held as treasury shares 
we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks  the revolving term of which runs to december the available credit line under this facility  currently million  is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
accordingly  oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation 
while the current price environment is quite strong  management can not predict how future price levels may change the banks long term price outlook 
to reduce the impact of any redetermination  we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
at year end  this excess capacity totaled million  or of the total available credit line 
management believes it has the ability to finance  if necessary  our capital requirements  including acquisitions 
oil and gas prices also affect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance 
please read note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility 
in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings  we have a period of days to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line 
the revolving credit agreement also includes a requirement to pay down half of the debt in excess of the adjusted credit line within the first days of any adjustment 
our interest expense for is projected to be million 
in may  a million principal payment is due on our notes 
the amount is reflected as current portion of long term debt on our balance sheet 
the payment is expected to be made with cash from operations and  if necessary  from increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
capitalization our capitalization information is as follows as of december  in millions long term debt current portion of long term debt total debt stockholders equity common stock net of treasury stock preferred stock total equity total capitalization debt to capitalization during  dividends were paid on our common stock totaling million and on our convertible redeemable preferred stock totaling million 
we have paid quarterly common stock dividends of per share since becoming publicly traded in the amount of future dividends is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition and capital requirements 
in may  we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the holder for million 
since this stock had been recorded at a stated value of million on our balance sheet  we realized a negative dividend to preferred stockholders of million 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of common stock in a public offering primarily to fund this transaction 
after repurchasing the preferred stock  the excess proceeds were used to reduce debt 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expenses total includes million in oil and gas properties acquired from oryx energy company in december total capital and exploration expenditures for increased million compared to  primarily as a result of the increased drilling program in the drilling program included an over increase in net wells drilled and a million increase in geological and geophysical expenses  including costs of obtaining seismic data 
during the last half of  we acquired million of oil and gas properties in the moxa arch in the rocky mountains area  including gross wells  approximately bcfe of proved reserves and approximately  net undeveloped acres that complement our existing moxa arch development 
we plan to drill gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes million in total capital and exploration expenditures  up from million in  and is our largest capital program to date 
expected spending in includes million for drilling and facilities  and million in exploration expenses 
in addition to the drilling and exploration program  other capital expenditures are planned primarily for lease acquisitions and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction 
we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
we generate tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels  including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale 
the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounts to per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to from qualified wells drilled in and a number of wells drilled in the appalachian region during and qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit 
the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale is estimated to be per mmbtu in in and  we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in and approximately million over the remaining two years 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt  to pay dividends  and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   the calculated ratio for was to in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
conclusion our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive terms 
the average produced natural gas sales price received in was higher than in however  prices were up only over  after declining from to the volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in with wide price swings in day to day trading on the nymex futures market 
given this continued price volatility  we can not predict with certainty what pricing levels will be in the future 
because future cash flows are subject to these variables  there is no assurance that our operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund our planned capital expenditures 
while our plan now includes million in capital and exploration spending  we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements  including  if necessary  reductions in capital and exploration expenditures or common stock dividends 
we believe our capital resources  supplemented with external financing if necessary  are adequate to meet our capital requirements

results of operations for the purpose of reviewing our results of operations  net income is defined as net income available to common stockholders 
selected financial and operating data in millions except where specified operating revenues operating expenses operating income interest expense net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted natural gas production bcf gulf coast west appalachia total company produced natural gas sales price mcf gulf coast west appalachia total company crude condensate volume mbbl price bbl the table below presents the after tax effects of certain selected items on our results of operations for the three years ended december  in millions net income before selected items buyout of gas sales contract impairment of long lived assets gain on sale of assets section tax credit provision negative preferred stock dividend contract settlements bad debt expense severance costs net income these selected items impacted our financial results 
because they are not a part of our normal business  we have isolated their effects in the table above 
these selected items for were as follows 
a million impairment million after tax was recorded on the beaurline field in south texas as a result of a casing collapse in two of the field s wells 

as a result of repurchasing all of the preferred stock at less than the book value  we recorded a million negative stock dividend in may 
miscellaneous net revenue  primarily from the settlement of a natural gas sales contract  was recorded in the first quarter million after tax 

as a result of bankruptcy proceedings of two of our customers  we recorded million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter million after tax 

we announced the closure of the regional office in pittsburgh in may and recorded costs of million million after tax 
these costs were recorded in the income statement categories that will receive the future savings benefit million in operations  million in exploration and million in administration 
these selected items for were as follows 
we had a year cogeneration contract under which we sold approximately of our western region natural gas per year 
the contract was due to expire in  but during we reached an agreement with the counterparty under which the counterparty bought out the remainder of the contract for million 
this transaction  completed in december  accelerated the realization of any future price premium that may have been associated with the contract and added million of pre tax other revenue million after tax 
we simultaneously sold forward a similar quantity of western region gas production through april at similar prices to those in the old contract 
the natural gas sales price stated in this new contract was significantly below year end market prices in the region 
if market prices remain above the fixed contract price beyond april  we could expect to realize notably higher natural gas sales prices on this production 

in the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairments totaling million on two of our producing fields in the gulf coast region million after tax 
the chimney bayou field was impaired by million due to a significant reserve revision on the broussard middleton r well in connection with a decline in its natural gas production accompanied by a marked increase in water production 
the broussard middleton r was the only producing well in this field 
the lawson field was impaired by million due to an unsuccessful workover on one of its wells 

we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas assets  most notably the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region sold to enervest effective october million after tax 

we recorded a million reserve against other revenue for certain wells no longer deemed to be eligible for the section tight gas sands credit following an industry tax court ruling million after tax 
late in  the ferc issued a rule proposal that may ultimately restore the eligibility for some or all of the wells in question 
for an update on the ferc s actions  please read note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
and compared the following discussion is based on our results before taking into account the selected items discussed above 
net income and revenues 
we reported net income in of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased million  or  and operating revenues increased million  or  in the improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million rise in natural gas sales due to the increase in gas prices  and the million increase in brokered natural gas sales revenue 
operating revenues were reduced by a million loss on natural gas price collar arrangements used during see further discussion in item a 
price and production volume increases in crude oil also contributed to the higher operating revenues 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 
the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the average appalachian natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing revenues by million 
natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was down bcf  or  to bcf primarily due to production difficulties in the beaurline field and delays in bringing new production on line in south louisiana 
natural gas production volume in the western region was down bcf to bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the mid continent area during and natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down bcf to bcf  as a result of the sale of certain non strategic assets in the appalachian region effective october   and a decrease in drilling activity in the region 
total natural gas production was down bcf  or  generating a revenue decrease of million in crude oil prices rose per bbl  or  to  resulting in an increase to operating revenues of approximately million 
the volume of crude oil sold in the year increased slightly to mbbls  increasing operating revenues by million 
brokered natural gas revenue increased million  or  over the prior year 
the sales price of brokered natural gas rose  resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
the volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by  reducing revenues by million 
after including the related brokered natural gas costs  we realized a net margin of million in excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in  and the sales contract buyout and the section tax credit provision in  other operating revenues increased million to million 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses from operations  excluding the selected items related to the impairment of long lived assets in each year and the costs associated with closing the regional office in pittsburgh during  increased million  or  from due primarily to the following 
brokered natural gas cost increased million  or  primarily due to the million impact of higher purchased natural gas prices 
this was partially offset by a million reduction to purchased natural cost  the result of fewer brokered sales this year compared to the prior year 

production and pipeline expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of costs associated with the expansion of the gulf coast regional office  both in staffing and office facilities 
additionally  operational costs for surface equipment and compressor maintenance were up in the rocky mountains area where we drilled more net wells in compared to on a units of production basis  our company wide production and pipeline expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in 
exploration expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of the following 
a million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to increased drilling activity in all regions 

a million increase in delay rental costs over last year largely due to delays in scheduled drilling projects in the gulf coast region 

a million increase for salaries  wages and incentive compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region to support the expanded drilling program 

a million increase in dry hole costs 
although the drilling success rate improved from in to in  we recorded two exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf coast region versus only one in 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense  excluding the selected item related to the sfas impairment in each year  increased million  or  over a decrease in total natural gas equivalent production caused the expense to remain just slightly above last year s level  despite the increase in the per unit expense to per mcfe 

general and administrative expenses remained at the same level as in 
taxes other than income increased million as a result of higher natural gas and oil revenues 
interest expense decreased million primarily due to lower average levels of borrowing on the revolving credit facility 
income tax expense was up million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax 
no significant asset sale activity occurred in gain on the sale of assets was million for these gains are the result of the non strategic asset divestitures  primarily the sale of the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region to enervest effective october and compared the following discussion is based on our results before taking into account the selected items discussed above 
net income and revenues 
we reported net income in of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased million  or  and operating revenues increased million  or  in the improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million increase in brokered natural gas revenue and the million rise in crude oil and condensate sales  due to both price improvements and production volume increases 
price and production volume increases in natural gas also contributed to the higher operating revenues 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 
net income was reduced by a million increase in interest expense 
natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up bcf  or  to bcf primarily due to production from the oryx acquisition  recent discoveries and development in the kacee field in south texas  and the redrilling of certain wells in the beaurline field 
natural gas production volume in the western region was down bcf to bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the mid continent area during and natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down bcf to bcf  as a result of the sale of certain non strategic assets in the appalachian region effective october   and a decrease in drilling activity in the region in total natural gas production was up bcf  or  yielding a revenue increase of million in the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the average appalachian natural gas production sales price remained flat to last year at per mcf 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing revenues by million 
the volume of crude oil sold in the year increased by mbbls  or  to mbbls  increasing operating revenues by million 
the volume increase was largely due to production from the oryx acquisition 
crude oil prices rose per bbl  or  to  resulting in an increase to operating revenues of approximately million 
brokered natural gas revenue increased million or over the prior year 
the sales price of brokered natural gas rose resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
additionally  the volume of natural gas brokered this year increased by  increasing revenues by million 
after including the related brokered natural gas costs  we realized a net margin of million in excluding the selected items regarding the sales contract buyout and the section tax credit provision  other operating revenues decreased million to million 
the decline was a result of decreases in activity in the following areas 
transportation revenue declined million 

revenue from our brine treatment plants declined million 

natural gas liquid sales declined million due to lower activity levels during 
section revenues decreased slightly due to normal production decline 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses from operations  excluding the selected item related to the impairment of long lived assets  increased million  or  from due primarily to the following 
brokered natural gas cost increased million  or  primarily due to increase in volume which added million of cost 
additionally  the purchase cost of natural gas rose resulting in an increase in brokered natural gas cost of million 

production and pipeline expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of the incremental cost of operating the oryx properties acquired in december on a units of production basis  production and pipeline expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in 
exploration expense decreased million  or  primarily as a result of 
a million reduction in dry hole costs from  largely due to a smaller drilling program in that resulted in seven dry holes compared to dry holes in 
a million decrease in geological and geophysical costs over last year largely due to a decline in seismic acquisition costs in the appalachian region 

depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense  excluding the select item related to the sfas impairment  increased million  or  over this increase was due to costs associated with the oryx properties  as well as higher finding costs in on certain fields in the gulf coast region that were largely related to mechanical difficulties associated with drilling 
a increase in total natural gas equivalent production  including a production increase in the higher finding cost gulf coast region  is the other major component of the dd a increase 

general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  due to 
lower non cash stock compensation expense for stock awards million 

lower outside consulting services million 
interest expense increased million primarily due to the debt increase for the oryx acquisition in december and to partially fund the drilling program 
income tax expense was up million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax 
gain on the sale of assets totaled million for compared to million in these gains are the result of the non strategic asset divestitures  primarily the sale of the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region to enervest effective october item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
oil and gas prices declined substantially in and  despite recent improvement  could decline again 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial results 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include 
the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas 

the level of consumer product demand 

weather conditions 

political conditions in oil producing regions  including the middle east 

the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 

the price of foreign imports 

actions of governmental authorities 

domestic and foreign governmental regulations 

the price  availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 

overall economic conditions 
these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 
in order to reduce our exposure to short term fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  we sometimes enter into hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and gas prices 
these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices 
please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
commodity price swaps and options hedges on our production from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling mmcf  representing less than of the company s natural gas production 
the notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was mbbls at a price of per bbl  which represents approximately of our total oil production for during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling  mmcf  representing of the company s natural gas production 
the notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was mbbls at a price of per bbl  which represents approximately one third of our total oil production for during  we did not enter into any fixed price swaps to hedge oil or natural gas production 
as of the years ending december   and  we had open natural gas price swap contracts on our production as follows natural gas price swaps volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period mmcf contract price in millions as of december  natural gas price swaps on our production in full year full year full year as of december  none financial derivatives related to natural gas production reduced revenues by million in and million in we had open oil price swap contracts on our production as follows oil price swaps volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period bbls contract price in millions as of december  none as of december  oil price swaps on our production in first quarter  second quarter  financial derivatives related to crude oil reduced revenue by million during and by million during there were no crude oil price swaps outstanding at december  during  we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a portion of our natural gas production 
there were seven collar arrangements based on separate regional price indexes with a weighted average price floor of mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of mcf 
these collars were in place during the months of april through october during this period  if the index rose above the ceiling price  we paid the counterparty 
if the applicable index fell below the floor price  the counterparty paid us 
these collars covered a total quantity of  mmcf  or of our annual production 
in april and may  the index prices all fell within the price collar and no settlements were made 
in june  all of the indexes rose above the ceiling prices and remained above the ceiling for the duration of the transaction resulting in a million reduction to our realized revenue for the year 
if these hedges had not been in place  our average realized natural gas price for would have been per mcf higher 
there were no commodity price collars in place during in december  we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of costless collars 
as of december   we had open natural gas costless price collar arrangements to hedge our production as follows natural gas price collars volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period mmcf ceiling floor in millions as of december  natural gas costless collars on our production in first quarter of  second quarter of  third quarter of  fourth quarter of  the natural gas price hedges  noted above  include several costless collar arrangements based on eight price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production 
these hedges are in place for the months of february through october and cover approximately half of our natural gas production during this period 
hedges on brokered transactions we use price swaps to hedge the natural gas price risk on brokered transactions 
typically  we enter into contracts to broker natural gas at a variable price based on the market index price 
however  in some circumstances  some of our customers or suppliers request that a fixed price be stated in the contract 
after entering into these fixed price contracts to meet the needs of our customers or suppliers  we may use price swaps to effectively convert these fixed price contracts to market sensitive price contracts 
these price swaps are held by us to their maturity and are not held for trading purposes 
we entered into price swaps with total notional quantities of  mmcf in   mmcf in  and  mmcf in  related to our brokered activities  representing   and  respectively  of our total volume of brokered natural gas sold 
as of the years ending december   and  we had open natural gas price swap contracts on brokered transactions as follows natural gas price swaps volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period mmcf contract price in millions as of december  none as of december  natural gas price swaps on brokered transactions in first quarter  financial derivatives related to natural gas reduced revenues by less than million in and increased revenues by million in we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
since its issuance  we have been modeling the impact of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
we had two types of hedges in place as of january  when sfas and sfas became effective 
the first type is a cash flow hedge that fixes the price of a certain monthly quantity of natural gas sold in the gulf coast region through september based on the current index price strip  the impact of this hedge on january  was to record a hedge loss of million and a charge to other comprehensive income of million 
correspondingly  a hedge liability for million was established 
the second type of hedge is a natural gas price costless collar agreement 
we entered into eight of these collars for a portion of our production at regional indexes for the months of february through october the collars have two components of value intrinsic value and time value 
under sfas  both components will be valued at the end of each reporting period 
intrinsic value arises when the index price is either above the ceiling or below the floor for any period covered by the collar 
if the index is above the ceiling for any month covered by the collar  the intrinsic value would be the difference between the index and the ceiling prices multiplied by the notional volume 
similar to the current accounting treatment  intrinsic value related to the current month would be recorded as a hedge loss if the index is above the ceiling or gain if the index is below the floor 
starting in under sfas  any changes in the intrinsic value component related to future months will be recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet  rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge is proven to be effective 
in the case of these natural gas price collars  full effectiveness with respect to the intrinsic value calculation is anticipated as they are tied to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold 
also new under sfas  the time value component  a market premium discount  is marked to market through the income statement each period 
since these collar arrangements were executed on the last business day of  the net premium value at adoption on january  is zero 
fair market value of financial instruments the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value 
we use available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt
