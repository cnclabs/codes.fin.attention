approximately of the company s earnings are attributable to the connecticut water company  the company s largest water utility subsidiary with approximately an additional derived from the company s two other regulated water utility companies  the gallup water service  incorporated and the crystal water company of danielson 
these three companies supply water to  customers in towns throughout the state of connecticut 
each of these companies is subject to regulation by the connecticut department of public utility control regarding financial issues  rates  and operating issues and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
in addition to its regulated utilities  the company owns four unregulated companies  chester realty  inc  a real estate company  connecticut water utility services  inc  which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services  connecticut water emergency services  inc  a provider of drinking and pool water by tanker truck and crystal water utilities corporation  a holding company which owns the crystal water company of danielson and three small rental properties

regulatory matters and inflation the connecticut water company is the company s largest subsidiary serving over  of the company s  utility customers 
connecticut water company s revenues  like the company s other two regulated water companies  are based on regulated rates that are determined in a regulatory rate proceeding 
connecticut water s last general rate proceeding was in the resulting rate decision granted connecticut water a allowed return on common equity and a allowed return on rate base 
the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand its service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
the ability of the company s water utility subsidiaries to recover this increased investment in facilities is primarily dependent upon future rate increases  which are subject to approval by the connecticut department of public utility control 
we do not presently plan to petition the dpuc for an increase in permanent rates in future economic and financial market conditions  coupled with governmental regulations and fiscal policy  plus other factors which are unpredictable and often beyond our control  will influence when we request revisions to rates charged to our customers 
outlook the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels

net non water sales earnings increased  or primarily as a result of our continuing efforts to increase earnings through unregulated activities 
one such endeavor initiated in was our linebacker sm maintenance service program 
for a small annual cost to our customers  the linebacker sm program protects them from incurring large expenses if their service lines should break 
utility operating income decreased  operating revenues decreased  or in as compared to this decrease is due to fluctuations in the summer weather  which directly affect our customers water usage

forward looking information this report  including management s discussion and analysis  contains certain forward looking statements regarding the company s results of operations and financial position 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations  and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from expected results 
our water companies are subject to various federal and state regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
generally  the water industry is materially dependent on the adequacy of approved rates to allow for a fair rate of return on the investment in utility plant 
the ability to maintain our operating costs at the lowest possible level while providing good quality water service is beneficial to customers and stockholders 
profitability is also dependent on the timeliness of rate relief  when necessary  and numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as the quantity of rainfall and temperature  industrial demand  financing costs  energy rates  and compliance with environmental and water quality regulations
