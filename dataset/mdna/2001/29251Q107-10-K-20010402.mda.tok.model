the arbitration hearing was held in november on march   enchira received an unfavorable ruling from the arbitrator in its arbitration proceeding with maxygen 
the arbitrator s opinion found that enchira breached several provisions of the collaboration agreement with maxygen with respect to enchira s rachitt tm and hts technologies  but remedies for such breaches were not specified in the ruling 
the arbitrator directed that the parties attempt to arrive at an agreement for an appropriate remedy 
if the parties cannot reach an agreement  they will again appear before the arbitrator who will issue a decision on damages or some other remedy 
while enchira will work with maxygen and the arbitrator to reach a conclusion to this proceeding  it also intends to investigate alternative actions that will permit enchira to continue to develop the rachitt tm technology that enchira continues to believe is its independent technology 
the ultimate resolution of the arbitrator s ruling could require enchira to pay costly licensing or royalty fees or result in an outright prohibition of enchira s use of such technology
