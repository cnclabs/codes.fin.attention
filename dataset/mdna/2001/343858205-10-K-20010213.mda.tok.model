factors that may affect future results general 
the company s projects are awarded by private or governmental entities in a competitive bidding process 
due to the nature of the bidding and award process  the company has experienced  and in the future expects to experience  significant delays in project awards 
no assurance can be given that the timing of a project award will be consistent with the company s expectations 
in addition  numerous factors  many of which are out of the company s ability to control  have caused and will continue to cause substantial variations in its results of operations in any quarterly or annual reporting period 
some of these factors are downturns in one or more segments of the construction industry  changes in economic conditions  the failure of project owners to obtain adequate construction financing  the failure of project general contractors to schedule other trades in a manner most efficient for flour city  the company s failure to obtain or delays in awards of major projects  the cancellation or delay of major projects  including cancellations or delays caused by job site labor problems and jurisdictional disputes  the company s failure to timely replace projects that have been completed or are nearing completion  dependence on large projects  the delay or abandonment of which could adversely affect the company  or the need to ensure access to adequate working capital to support expanded business operations 
any of these factors could cause the company s results of operations to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
foreign exchange risks 
the company generally attempts to mitigate foreign exchange risk by entering into contracts providing for payment in united states dollars instead of the local currency wherever possible 
nonetheless  local currency must be used to pay for local labor  raw materials or other local country costs of operations 
the company currently has contracts denominated in the hong kong dollar  thai baht  british pound and philippine peso 
future contracts may be denominated in the currency of other countries 
the company maintains cash  short term debt based on floating interest rates  accounts receivable  and accounts payable in several currencies 
the functional currencies in which those accounts are maintained match the functional currencies of construction contracts in process 
accounts are also maintained in united states dollars in all countries in which the company operates 
the following table shows the october   united states dollar translated balances of selected non us dollar denominated current accounts by the currency in which they are maintained hong kong in millions dollars thai baht british pound philippine pesos cash and restricted cash short term debt accounts payable and accrued expenses us dollar exchange rate at october  materials and services to perform project contracts are procured globally 
aluminum extrusion is typically the largest material cost and is generally denominated in united states dollars 
glass purchases are generally denominated in united states dollars unless sourced locally in a foreign locale 
the expenses associated with erection services are generally denominated in local currency 
to the extent that foreign currencies weaken against the united states dollar  the company will experience translation losses due to the revaluation of accounts payable  accounts receivable and other asset and liability accounts 
the company generally attempts to contract to secure compensation for devaluation of local currencies relative to the united states dollar 
in these instances  although the company may incur translation losses  the company seeks to offset such losses by increases in the amount of local currency payable to the company under contract so as to approximate the original united states dollar equivalent value of the contract 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in negotiating contracts with terms that maintain a united states dollar equivalency 
as of october   the company s backlog of non us dollar based contracts totaled approximately million 
of that amount contract provisions to ensure united states dollar equivalency did not protect approximately million 
exchange rate fluctuations in local currency denominated contracts that do not have a united states dollar equivalency  and in exchange rates in general  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
political uncertainties 
the company operates in several countries in asia 
economic development in countries in which the company operates may be limited by the imposition of measures intended to control economic conditions and the inadequate development of an infrastructure to support manufacturing and large scale construction projects 
changes in governmental policies as well as general economic conditions including interest rates or rates of inflation could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of october   the company had no material holdings of commodity based instruments  long term debt instruments  forward contracts  futures contracts  firmly committed foreign sales contracts  interest rate swaps  currency swaps  or other items in the nature of derivative financial instruments 
the company does maintain cash  short term debt based on floating interest rates  accounts receivable  and accounts payable in several currencies
