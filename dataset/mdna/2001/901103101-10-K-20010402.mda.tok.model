all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph 
item business overview our principal executive offices are located at west las positas boulevard  pleasanton  california our telephone number is we were incorporated in california in august  began operations in august  and reincorporated in delaware in september we design  develop and market multi service broadband access systems that enable service providers to deliver high speed data access to multi tenant buildings 
we use our proprietary fastcopper technologies to deliver cost effective  scalable and easy to deploy solutions that exploit the underutilized bandwidth of copper telephone wires within these buildings 
our products also provide service providers with enhanced capabilities such as subscriber management  bandwidth management  plug and play installation  portal redirection  internet protocol address management  or ip address management  service authorization and network address translation 
in addition  we recently introduced our intellipoptm product which utilizes our proprietary signature switchtm technology and is designed to allow service providers to manage and guarantee bandwidth and service performance across applications such as ip telephony  virtual private networking  or vpn networking  videoconferencing  video on demand  file transfer and internet access and to efficiently configure intellipop for the delivery of these services according to the unique market requirements of multi tenant building owners and end user subscribers on an individual or collective basis 
our systems and related services are designed with the specific requirements of the multi tenant unit  or mtu  market in mind and enable service providers in this market to increase their revenue by providing additional services and increase customer retention through bundled service offerings 
industry background increasing demand for high speed internet access in recent years  there has been a dramatic increase in demand by businesses and consumers for high speed data access to the internet and to private corporate networks 
this demand is being driven by the growth in users who are accessing networks for a variety of applications  including communications via the internet and corporate intranets  electronic commerce  and telecommuting 
this growth is projected to continue to increase rapidly over the next several years 
as an example of the growth in high speed access  the vertical systems group has projected that total digital subscriber line  or dsl  connections in the united states will increase from thousand in to over million in vertical systems group also projected that worldwide dsl connections would grow from thousand in to over million in to meet this increasing need for high speed access  telecommunications service providers have significantly upgraded both backbone and local networks with broadband fiber optic facilities and high speed switches  routers  and multiplexers 
in some cases  these service providers are bringing fiber optic links all the way to residential neighborhoods or to the basements of commercial office buildings 
in addition  other service providers are building wireless broadband access networks using recently available radio spectrum  or are using hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks that are traditionally used to provide cable tv service 
service providers may also use the copper based infrastructure of an incumbent local exchange carrier  or ilec  or a government controlled post  telephone and telegraph company  or ptt  to offer dsl based services 
these new networks offer speeds more than times faster than today s kbps dial up modems 
although service providers are bringing broadband facilities closer to residential and commercial end users  they remain challenged by the cost and logistics associated with extending this bandwidth all the way to internet devices in a consumer s home or to the local area network  or lan  of a small business office 
these challenges are particularly acute in mtu complexes where the end user typically does not directly own the network infrastructure in place  and where the majority of the existing infrastructure tends to be the copper wires being used to provide existing telephone service 
the mtu market can be separated into two markets residential and commercial 
the residential mtu market  also known as the multi dwelling unit  or mdu  market  consists primarily of apartments  hotels  and university dormitories 
data from the us census bureau indicates that the domestic apartment market totals over million individual tenant units  with million of these units being located in buildings or complexes of or more units 
data from the us department of commerce indicates that the domestic hotel market consists of million rooms  with million rooms in buildings of more than rooms 
we believe that these larger buildings and complexes are the initial target for high speed internet access 
the commercial mtu market  also known as the multi tenant commercial unit  or mcu  market  represents office complexes and other business related facilities 
according to data from torto wheaton research  there is more than billion square feet of rentable commercial office space in the largest metropolitan markets across the united states 
mtu market characteristics since the demand for high speed internet access has increased significantly over the last couple of years  we believe that owners and managers of apartments  hotels and commercial properties have begun to view high speed internet access as a critical enhanced service for their residents  guests and tenants 
there is demand from owners of mtu complexes and buildings to offer internet access and other broadband services as an amenity that effectively attracts and retains occupants  thereby increasing revenue and profitability 
given the complexity and cost of deploying broadband services  many property owners prefer to outsource ownership  installation  operation and management of high speed internet solutions to an mtu focused service provider 
in exchange for granting a service provider the ability to market and provide telecommunications services to their properties  these mtu owners have an opportunity to offer new internet enabled services and to potentially share in some of the service revenues generated from their buildings 
these services enable on line reservation of building amenities  community message boards  e commerce and electronic payment of rent 
a set of specialized service providers and divisions of incumbent service providers have emerged over the last few years to fill the growing demand for high speed internet service to the mtu market 
while high speed internet access is the primary service delivered by these service providers today  we believe that the delivery of multiple services  such as high speed corporate networking  packet voice and ip video  will be the key to meeting future customer needs and driving service provider profitability through bundled service offerings 
the mtu market is attractive to these service providers because of the efficiency of delivering multiple services  often on an exclusive basis  to a geographically concentrated and demographically similar customer base 
infrastructure requirements for mtu service providers service providers marketing to mtu owners and tenants typically concentrate their networks  as well as sales and marketing efforts within major metropolitan areas 
in each local service area  a service provider will locate a metropolitan point of presence  or metro pop  that will concentrate high speed  last mile access links from multiple mtus  provide value added services such as web hosting and e mail  manage subscriber access  centralize billing  and provide an efficient link to backbone internet or intranet networks 
the high speed links from a service provider s metro pop to individual mtu buildings or complexes may consist of local t facilities sourced from an ilec  xdsl facilities sourced from a competitive local exchange carrier  or clec  or self provisioned fiber  coaxial cable  or radio facilities 
once broadband access is brought to the mtu  another broadband distribution network needs to be created within the building to bring the offered services to tenants 
alternatives for creating this network include rewiring the building with category copper wire for ethernet  laying a new fiber based infrastructure or reusing the copper infrastructure that is already in place to provide telephone service 
rewiring with category wire or laying new fiber links can be prohibitively expensive on a per subscriber basis because in most cases a service provider will only have demand from a limited number of tenants in the building  yet the entire building will need to be rewired to accommodate future and changing requirements 
similarly  carrier class dsl access multiplexers  known as dslams  which are designed to serve hundreds of subscribers over the existing telephone wires  are prohibitively expensive when only serving a limited number of tenants 
we believe that service providers for the mtu market require systems that 
deliver reliable high quality broadband access services in a cost effective manner  
are easy to deploy and provision  and are economically scalable from as few as four subscribers in small buildings to hundreds of subscribers in large complexes  
support and manage the bandwidth for multiple services such as voice  video  and vpn networking so as to maximize both the network infrastructure and the sales  marketing and operations infrastructure of the service provider  and 
are remotely controlled  maintained and upgraded as required 
we believe that systems with these characteristics enable service providers to increase their revenue by providing additional services and increase customer retention through bundled service offerings 
the tut systems solution we design  develop and market multi service broadband access systems that enable service providers to deliver high speed data access over the existing copper telephone infrastructure found in mtu complexes  such as apartment buildings  hotels  business parks and commercial office buildings 
our systems also provide service providers with enhanced capabilities such as subscriber management  bandwidth management  plug and play installation  portal redirection  ip address management  service authorization and network address translation 
our systems are designed with the specific requirements of the mtu market in mind and provide the following benefits to our customers 
reliable  high performance  cost effective  broadband access 
our access products use our proprietary fastcopper technology to exploit the underutilized bandwidth of existing mtu infrastructures by reducing the noise  radio frequency interference and signal cross talk inherent in high speed data transmission over copper telephone wires 
our technology enables cost effective ethernet lans to be quickly implemented over these telephone wires  without interfering with existing telephone service that may be running over these same wires 
our proprietary homerun technology has been adopted as the first generation standard for home networking over copper telephone wires by the home phone network alliance  or homepna  and is licensed to leading semiconductor  computer hardware and consumer electronics manufacturers 
our proprietary longrun technology is similar in operation to our homerun technology  but provides higher performance in the presence of noise and cross talk  and transmits over longer distances than homerun 

easy to deploy  scalable systems 
our expresso gs  mdu and mdu lite systems  which are integrated with our proprietary fastcopper technologies  provide low cost  high speed bandwidth to multiple tenants within an mtu complex or building while meeting our service provider customers ease of use and scalability requirements 
the expresso mdu unit is intended for deployment in the basements of apartment buildings  in wiring rooms of hotels and in other residential locations where access lines are centrally concentrated 
our compact mdu lite product extends the delivery of high speed services to tenants living in the smaller buildings typically found in garden style apartment complexes 

multiple value added  revenue enhancing services 
our expresso sms and expresso ocs systems provide plug and play functionality  subscriber management  community web pages  credit card billing and other functions for the mdu market 
when used to provide high speed internet access to hotel guests  the expresso sms system interfaces with our expresso mdu system to provide a simple plug and play experience for the guest without disturbing normal phone service or requiring computer reconfiguring by the guest 
our recently introduced intellipop product is designed to allow service providers to manage and guarantee bandwidth and service performance across applications such as ip telephony  vpn networking  videoconferencing  video on demand  file transfer and internet access and to efficiently configure the delivery of these services according to the unique market requirements of multi tenant building owners and end user subscribers on an individual or collective basis

our products use industry standard protocols for interoperability with third party systems and are based on industrial grade computing platforms for continuous industry driven improvements in price and performance 
strategy our objective is to be the dominant provider of advanced multi service broadband access systems that exploit the large existing infrastructure of copper telephone wires within multi tenant complexes  such as apartment buildings  hotels  office buildings  business parks  university dormitories and other buildings 
key elements of our business strategy are as follows facilitate rapid growth in mdu markets 
we market our expresso mdu and related products to service providers that are focused on the residential mdu market and can benefit from highly scalable internet access solutions with low initial deployment costs 
we actively work with our customers both to deploy systems in additional properties as well as to facilitate the adoption of broadband access services by tenants in buildings in which our systems are already deployed 
we intend to continue to focus our direct sales and marketing efforts on establishing additional customer relationships with large mdu service providers 
in addition  we intend to reach smaller service providers through our network of value added resellers  or vars  and systems integrators 
accelerate penetration in mcu markets 
we plan to accelerate our penetration of the commercial mcu market with our intellipop system that has been designed to offer speeds greater than mbps over single pair  telephone grade wire 
using a patent pending signature switch architecture  intellipop is designed to allow service providers to quickly and cost effectively deliver multiple  high performance broadband services through classification and prioritization of device and or application specific network traffic 
intellipop is currently being evaluated by several potential customers 
enhance the service capabilities provided by our products and systems 
by adding higher level features and functions above the basic data transport layer  such as subscriber management  network address translation  traffic prioritization  bandwidth limiting  ip telephony and vpn networking support to our product line  we enable our service provider customers to expand the range of services that they can market and deploy to their customers 
service providers  in turn  can leverage their sales and marketing efforts  reduce customer turnover  and have a higher revenue to cost portfolio of services 
we intend to lower the total cost of system ownership for our customers by reducing manufacturing costs  expanding the self provisioning features of our systems  and enhancing network management capabilities 
in addition  we expect to utilize technology obtained from our freegate  xstreamis and activetelco acquisitions in the further development of our intellipop product platform 
expand international presence 
we believe that our expresso and intellipop product lines  which have been developed in conformance with international standards  can serve a substantial market for high speed data access products outside of the united states 
we are adding personnel in several key international markets and are actively seeking to add new international distributors who focus on the mtu market 
core technologies and products we have developed a broad base of proprietary fastcopper technology to address noise and distortion problems so that high speed data access can be achieved over a single pair of ordinary copper telephone wires used in corporate and educational campuses  apartment buildings  hotels and single family homes 
our fastcopper technology encompasses three main areas of expertise to maximize transmission rates at minimum costs over existing copper telephone wires noise reduction  analog and digital signal processing to reduce distortion  and digital modulation techniques 
our fastcopper expertise is deployed in our homerun  longrun and other transmission technologies 
homerun creates a cost effective ethernet lan over the random topology of home telephone wires  without disturbing existing telephone service and or g 
lite asymmetrical dsl  or g 
lite adsl  service running simultaneously over these same wires 
with homerun  multiple devices can share peripherals and or a single high speed internet access connection on a mbps ethernet lan 
homerun supports internet connections through integrated services digital network  or isdn  or xdsl wireline technologies  a wireless modem or a cable modem 
longrun shares similar modulation techniques with homerun  but operates at lower baseband frequencies to provide improved performance in the presence of intra system crosstalk and coverage of longer distances that may be found in many apartment  hotel  and university dormitory complexes 
homerun is designed to operate at distances up to feet  while longrun is intended to operate at distances up to  feet 
the following products are based in part on this fastcopper technology foundation and are augmented by additional technologies that allow for enhanced capabilities expresso system platforms our expresso mdu products are designed to be used by ilecs  ptts  clecs and other service providers to provide high speed advanced data services to large numbers of end users over private copper network infrastructures 
expresso mdu is ac powered and  when integrated with our homerun or longrun technology  provides owners of private copper networks with an easy to deploy and scalable means to distribute high speed data access to tenants over the copper telephone wires found in mtus 
in addition  we offer our expresso gs system  which is dc powered and intended for use by service providers to serve last mile applications using xdsl technologies 
an expresso mdu or expresso gs system consists of a compact  modular central site shelf with a simple network management protocol  or snmp  management card  optional switching  multiplexing and wide area network  or wan  interface cards  and up to xdsl  homerun or longrun line cards 
the inch high system is available with two mounting options  either inches wide for data center and international installations or inches wide for telephone company installations

expresso mdu expresso mdu integrates our homerun and longrun technologies with our flexible expresso platform to provide owners of mdus with easy to deploy  scalable and cost effective solutions to distribute high speed data access to multiple tenants over the private copper networks within mdus 
the expresso mdu platform has been designed for deployment in residential locations  such as in the basement wiring room of an apartment building 
expresso mdu can be equipped with homerun and or longrun line cards to provide a secure ethernet lan for each living unit within an mdu 
we have developed homerun and longrun adapters that convert homerun longrun signals to a standard base t ethernet interface 
consumer products  such as pcs  peripherals  internet telephones and television based web browsers  that are compatible with either version or version of homepna can directly connect to the expresso mdu without the need for any additional adapter or network interface card 
expresso mdu lite to provide service to small apartment buildings spread across a garden style complex in which there is no central wiring point  we developed the expresso mdu lite and the expresso longrun mdu lite 
the former is intended for domestic and international markets  while the latter is primarily intended for international markets 
the expresso mdu lite contains either eight ports of homerun or eight ports of longrun 
multiple units may be connected together to support more than eight subscribers and these units may be connected back to a central point via longrun copper based products  coax based cable modems  or radio based modems 
expresso gs for local loop applications  we offer the expresso gs system  which consists of xdsl line cards connected to mxl series routers 
the mxl series routers  when used with a synchronous dsl  or sdsl  line card  will provide access at mbps 
our dynamic smartwire sdsl rate adaptation enables all subscribers to be served at the highest attainable speeds over each loop 
through expresso s all rate dsl feature  a service provider can offer tiered access services in increments of kbps to meet the varying bandwidth and price requirements of each subscriber 
expresso s all rate dsl feature also allows service providers to offer a low cost  low bandwidth  entry level service that can expand to higher bandwidth capabilities as each subscriber s need for bandwidth expands 
our mxl routers provide a standard base t interface for connection to users pcs or lans 
expresso sms our expresso sms and companion expresso ocs system provide plug and play functionality  subscriber management  network address translation  credit card billing  and other functions for the mdu market 
the compact inch high expresso sms system runs on a red hat linux operating system  is typically located on the premises of an mdu complex and supports up to simultaneous user sessions per unit 
the companion expresso ocs operations center software is intended to be located at a metro pop or central network operations center 
the expresso ocs system is a software package that runs on a standard pc computing platform 
each expresso ocs system can manage up to remote expresso sms systems  providing central credit card billing interfaces  accounting records  and access to the accounting and policy data bases most often used by clecs and internet service providers  or isps 
intellipop system the recently introduced intellipop system  currently under evaluation by potential customers  includes the port service gateway and the service access unit 
a comprehensive tut management system is under development that will allow full utilization of the service management aspects of intellipop 
the intellipop service gateway is a small service platform  less than two inches high  that combines the functionality of an edge router  a high speed switch  and an access multiplexer with powerful bandwidth management tools to distribute multiple ip based services to individual tenants throughout a small or mid sized commercial building 
the intellipop service gateway incorporates very high speed dsl based  or vdsl based  line side ports  each of which can deliver up to mbps of symmetric bandwidth to a customer premises unit 
the service access unit includes two base t ports for interfacing to a variety of end user devices and or networks 
subsequent versions of intellipop are under development that will incorporate higher access speeds  higher port capacities  and features specifically tailored for the apartment and hospitality markets 
xl products we use our fastcopper technology  along with commercially available components  to build high speed data access products 
in the xl product series  we applied our noise reduction and signal processing expertise to build a mbps  foot ethernet lan extension product to operate over a single pair of copper telephone wires 
for other xl products  we pioneered the use of rate adaptive sdsl technology in products that extend transmission distances up to  feet without the use of repeaters 
for homerun  we developed a proprietary modulation technique to transmit high speed data signals over the random tree and branch networks typically found in single family homes 
in the xl product  we applied our noise reduction and signal processing expertise to enable a mbps ethernet lan extension at distances up to  feet over a single copper pair 
customers and markets we target our development  marketing and sales efforts to service providers in both the mdu and mcu markets 
mdu market service providers  including ilecs  ptts  clecs  isps and multiple system operators for the cable industry  can recognize substantial economies of scale by providing high speed services to mdu tenants from a single point of service 
mdus include apartment complexes  hotels  university dormitories and military housing complexes 
we believe that the potential international mdu market represents a strategic opportunity for us 
our potential customers in the mdu market include both service providers who seek to sell services to mdu tenants and owners of mdu complexes who seek to offer advanced amenities to their tenants  increase property value  and or gain additional revenue from the property 
our expresso sms system has been designed with features to specifically address the needs of this market 
among our expresso mdu customers throughout most of the calendar year were cais  inc  darwin networks  inc  i quest corporation  reflex communications  inc  and velocity hsi  inc abrupt changes in the capital markets have led each of these companies to narrow the focus of their market activities and severely curtail previous levels of operations including their deployment of our product 
in the case of darwin networks  inc  in january  they filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
in the case reflex communications  inc  in march  they filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
we also saw a fall off in sales to customers in the korean market  including sales to trigem infocomm  as a result of regulatory and other changes within that marketplace 
as a result  we are depending more heavily on the development of our relationships with other international customers and the business divisions of ilecs  clecs and ptts 
mcu market for some time there have been service providers focused on delivering voice services to tenants in multi tenant commercial buildings  but over the last few years  a new class of service providers and business divisions of ilecs and ptts have emerged that plan to use broadband ip based infrastructures to provide a wide array of bundled services  including high speed internet access  email  web hosting  firewall protection  local and long distance voice  and business tv to tenants in multi tenant commercial buildings 
these mcu service providers are demanding a low cost  multi service  broadband platform on which to deliver this array of services to the small and medium size businesses that tend to locate in mcus 
among our current mcu customers are cygcom integrated technologies  inc  newcom americas  inc  rikei corporation and rycom cci  inc the initial version of our intellipop system has been designed to specifically address the needs of the mcu market in terms of performance  size  and ease of installation 
we believe that intellipop incorporates the high speed access technologies  high performance processing technologies  and sophisticated bandwidth management techniques required by business end users 
at the same time  the intellipop service gateway is designed to be an easy to deploy rack mountable or wall mountable unit that is less than two inches high allowing for easy and cost effective deployment in the smallest of multi tenant buildings 
several existing and potential customers are currently evaluating the intellipop product 
for simple point to point applications  we market our xl products to domestic and international end users for lan extensions over existing copper telephone wires 
we have several hundred domestic and international customers for our xl product line 
home networking the growth in the demand for high speed data access  the decreasing cost of personal computers and the proliferation of internet access devices in homes are creating an emerging demand for home networking and access solutions 
home networks must be designed to allow the sharing of files  the sharing of peripherals  such as printers  the simultaneous  uninterrupted use of voice service and  perhaps most importantly  the sharing of internet and remote corporate network access 
home network consumers desire a low cost  easy to implement network solution that does not require new wires to be installed throughout the home 
we are licensing our homerun technology to members of the homepna and others

in and  we established new sales channels in canada  europe  south america  australia and asia 
in  we opened a sales office in the united kingdom 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from customers in international markets 
we believe that our products can serve a substantial market for high speed data access products outside of the united states 
customer support we believe that consistent high quality service and support is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers 
service and technical support of our products is coordinated by our customer support organization located in pleasanton  california 
telecommunications and networking systems engineers provide critical technical support to our customers 
our systems application engineers  located in each of our sales regions  support pre and post sales activities 
we also employ a nationwide third party support organization to handle inquiries from a large number of customers and provide first level telephone technical support and on site installation and support services 
customers can also access technical information and receive technical support through the internet 
research and development our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products 
our research and development organization emphasizes early stage system engineering 
the product development process begins with a comprehensive functional product specification based on input from the sales and marketing organizations 
we incorporate feedback from end users and distribution channels  and through participation in industry events  industry organizations and standards development bodies 
key elements of our research and development strategy include 
core designs 
we seek to develop platform architectures and core designs that allow for cost effective deployment and flexible upgrades that meet the needs of multiple markets and applications 
these designs emphasize quick time to market and future cost reduction potential 
the expresso gs mdu and intellipop platforms are a direct result of this strategy 

product line extensions 
we seek to extend our existing product lines through product modifications and enhancements in order to meet the needs of particular customers and markets 
products resulting from our product line extension efforts include the expresso mdu lite 

use of industry standard components 
our design philosophy emphasizes the use of industry standard hardware and software components whenever possible to reduce time to market  decrease the cost of goods and lessen the risks inherent in new design 
we maximize the use of third party software for operating systems and certain protocol stacks which allows our software engineers to concentrate on hardware specific drivers  user interface software and advanced features 

new technologies 
we seek to enhance our product lines by incorporating additional xdsl technologies  such as vdsl  higher speed wan interfaces and new network management software features 
our intellipop suite of products currently under customer evaluation is designed to utilize technology from our freegate  xstreamis and activetelco acquisitions and to incorporate components of our existing products  technologies and designs 
we also seek to develop new product capabilities through software upgrades to our expresso sms platform 
manufacturing we do not manufacture any of our own products 
we rely on contract manufacturers to assemble  test and package our products 
we require iso registration for these contract manufacturers as a condition of qualification 
we audit each contractor s manufacturing process performance through audits  testing and inspections and monitor each contractor s quality through incoming testing and inspection of packaged products received from each contractor 
in addition  we monitor the reliability of our products through in house repair  reliability audit testing and field data analysis 
we currently purchase all of our raw materials and components used in our products through our contract manufacturers 
we and our contract manufacturers have experienced difficulty in obtaining some components used in our products 
we forecast our product requirements to maintain sufficient product inventory to allow us to meet the short delivery times demanded by our large and diverse customer base  which is typically one to four days from receipt of order to shipment to the customer 
however  because of recent changes in the industry  we have had to cancel certain finished goods and component orders which may have a negative impact on our ability to diversify our product manufacturing across a larger base of contract manufacturers 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain manufacturing on time  at low costs and in sufficient quantities to meet demand 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive  continually evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we believe that we and our products face the following competitive factors 
conformance to industry standards  
breadth of product lines  
implementation of additional product features and enhancements  including improvements in product performance  reliability  size  and scalability  
low cost and ease of deployment and use  
sales and distribution capability  
technical support  and 
service and general industry and economic conditions 
although we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to all of these factors  there can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
we expect that competition in each of our markets will increase in the future 
our principal competitors include or are expected to include cisco systems  inc  copper mountain networks  inc  elastic networks  inc  paradyne networks  inc  and a number of other public and private companies 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than us 
these competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced will not harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  some of our licensees may sell aspects of our technology to our competitors or potential competitors 
these competitors may cause an erosion in the potential market for our products 
this competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also compete with technologies using alternative transmission media such as coaxial cable  wireless facilities and fiber optic cable 
to the extent that telecommunications service providers choose to install fiber optic cable or other transmission media in the last mile  or to the extent that homeowners and businesses install other transmission media within buildings  we expect that demand for our copper telephone wire based products will decline 
these competitive pressures from alternative transmission technologies may further necessitate price reductions of our existing and future products 
proprietary rights our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trade secret laws and non disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we currently hold united states patents and have united states patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to pending or future patent applications or that our patents will be upheld as valid or will prevent the development of competitive products 
we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by limiting access to the distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain customers  vendors and strategic partners 
the steps taken by us in this regard may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology and our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
we are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
in this regard  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to our current or future products or that any of these claims will not require us to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of those claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  these licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
employees as of february   we employed persons  including 
in operations  
in sales  marketing and customer support  
in research and development  and 
in finance  administration  and information technology support 
we also employ a number of contract employees  especially for technical publications and systems verification 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages to date 
item facilities our principal administrative and engineering facilities are located in facilities totaling approximately  square feet located in pleasanton  california 
in addition  we lease sales and administrative facilities totaling approximately  square feet in beaverton  oregon  and engineering and administrative facilities totaling approximately  square feet in sunnyvale  california 
we also lease engineering facilities in ann arbor  michigan 
the lease for the pleasanton facility expires in april  with an option to renew for five years  the lease for the oregon facility expires in march  the lease for the sunnyvale facility expires in august and the lease for the ann arbor facility expires in december we recently vacated offices in pleasant hill  california and oakland  california 
the lease for the pleasant hill facility expires in may and the lease for the oakland facility expires in april we currently sublet certain of our facilities 
we believe that our facilities will be adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed

overview we design  develop and market multi service broadband access systems that enable service providers to deliver high speed data access to multi tenant buildings 
we use our proprietary fastcopper technology to deliver cost effective  scalable and easy to deploy solutions that exploit the underutilized bandwidth of copper telephone wires within these buildings 
our collection of fastcopper technologies includes homerun  which was selected as the initial specification for a home networking standard promoted by the homepna  and longrun  a proprietary extension of homerun providing superior performance at longer distances 
these technologies are deployed through our expresso high bandwidth access multiplexers and associated routers 
in addition to our expresso access multiplexers are our products that provide service providers with enhanced capabilities such as subscriber management  bandwidth management  ip address management  and network address translation 
recently  we introduced our intellipop product line with proprietary signature switch technology 
our proprietary signature switch technology is designed to allow service providers to manage and guarantee bandwidth and service performance across applications such as ip telephony  vpn networking  videoconferencing  video on demand  file transfer and internet access  and to efficiently configure intellipop for the delivery of these services according to the unique market requirements of multi tenant building owners and end user subscribers on an individual or collective basis 
we commenced operations in august through the third quarter of  substantially all of our revenue was derived from the sale of our xl ethernet lan extension products to the corporate and university segments of the mcu market 
in early  we introduced the first products in our expresso product line aimed at service provider markets 
during the first quarter of  we began licensing our homerun technology to certain leading semiconductor  computer hardware and consumer electronics manufacturers for incorporation into integrated circuits and consumer products including pcs  peripherals  modems and other internet appliances 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we commenced selling our expresso gs products  which are configured for local loop applications  and expresso mdu products  which incorporate our homerun technology to a broader range of service providers  primarily those serving apartment complexes  hotels  university dormitories and military complexes in the mdu market 
in the first quarter of  we commenced selling expresso mdu products incorporating our longrun technology and expresso mdu lite into additional segments of the mdu market 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced selling our expresso sms and companion expresso ocs system providing subscriber management  bandwidth management  credit card billing and other functions to the mdu market 
during the first quarter of  we commenced selling our onegate internet server appliances  acquired as a result of our freegate acquisition  to the mcu market 
during the last quarter of  our new intellipop product was under evaluation by several potential customers 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products and  to a lesser extent  through the licensing of our homerun technology and the sale of our software products 
we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from service obligations included in product revenues is deferred and generally recognized ratably over the period of the obligation 
we also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 
estimated sales returns  and warranty costs based on historical experience by product  are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
our products generally carry a one year to two year warranty from the date of purchase 
estimated sales returns  and warranty costs based on historical experience by product  are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
license and royalty revenue consists of nonrefundable up front license fees  some of which may offset initial royalty payments  and royalties 
currently  the majority of our license and royalty revenue is comprised of non refundable license fees paid in advance 
such revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which post contract customer support is expected to be provided or upon delivery and transfer of agreed upon technical specifications in contracts where essentially no further support obligations exist 
future license and royalty revenue is expected to consist primarily of royalties based on products sold by our licensees 
we do not expect that such license and royalty revenue will constitute a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods 
with the introduction of our intellipop product line  we expect that revenue from the sale of software products and maintenance fees will constitute a substantial portion of revenue in future periods 
we expect that sales price reductions on some of our products will be necessary to remain competitive and to reduce relatively high levels of inventory 
although we have historically been able to offset most price declines with reductions in our manufacturing costs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset further price declines with cost reductions 
in addition  some of our licensees may sell products based on our technology to our competitors or potential competitors 
there can be no assurance that our homerun technology will be successfully deployed on a widespread basis or that such licensing will not result in an erosion of the potential market for our products 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on average  we expect international sales to represent approximately one half or less of our revenue 
however  actual results  both geographically and in absolute dollars  may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of orders placed by customers 
to date  all international sales have been denominated in us dollars 
we expect to continue to evaluate product line expansion and new product opportunities  engage in extensive research  development and engineering activities and focus on cost effective design of our products 
accordingly  we will continue to make significant expenditures on sales and marketing  and research and development activities 
in june  we acquired publicport  inc in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
this transaction was treated as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes

activetelco provided an internet telephony platform that enabled internet and telecommunications service providers to integrate and deliver web based telephony applications such as unified messaging  long distance service  voicemail and fax delivery  call forwarding  call conferencing and callback services 
while we expect to derive benefits from sales of product lines that are designed  developed and marketed as a result of these acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the development and commercial deployment of certain of these products or expand sales of those products which have already been completed 
in january  we decided to abandon future sales of the existing onegate product that we acquired in the freegate acquisition 
the related onegate and other intellectual property acquired from freegate is being incorporated into the design of future products 
through these completed transactions  we have added approximately people to our workforce 
the costs associated with personnel including rent for additional facilities and related general and administrative costs as well as costs associated with research and development  and sales and marketing activities substantially increased our operating costs in fiscal year when compared to related costs expended in fiscal year in january  we reduced our total workforce by in efforts to control overall operating expenses in response to recent declines in and expected slowing of our sales growth 
we have incurred net operating losses to date and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
our ability to generate income from operations will be primarily dependent on increases in sales volume  reductions in manufacturing costs and the growth of high speed data access solutions in the service provider and mtu markets 
in view of our limited history of product revenue from new markets  reliance on growth in deployment of high speed data access solutions and the unpredictability of orders and subsequent revenue  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
failure to generate significant revenue from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  or the inability to reduce manufacturing costs  will harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december total revenues total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general administrative in process research and development amortization of intangibles noncash compensation expenses provision for doubtful accounts total operating expenses loss from operations impairment of certain equity investments interest expense interest income other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss dividend accretion on preferred stock net loss attributable to common stockholders years ended december   and revenue 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products and  to a lesser extent  through the licensing of our homerun technology and from the sale of software products 
our total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  using a year over year comparison  the increases in and were primarily due to increased sales of our expresso mdu products 
however  during the fourth quarter of  revenue growth slowed substantially due to several key customers who  in the latter part of the fourth quarter experienced a rapid deterioration in their ability to obtain additional capital and  as a result  severely curtailed or halted their purchases of our product  and also due to a fall off in sales to the korean market 
this resulted in fourth quarter revenues of million compared with revenues of million for the first three quarters of in aggregate and million for the fourth quarter of license and royalty revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to increases in royalty payments 
the increase in was primarily due to increases in up front license fees recognized during the year and receipt of related royalty payments 
there was one new license and royalty agreement signed during fiscal year cost of goods sold gross margin 
cost of goods sold consists of raw materials  contract manufacturing  personnel costs  test and quality assurance for products  and cost of licensed technology included in the products 
our cost of goods sold before provision for loss on purchase commitments and abandoned products increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increases in and were primarily due to increased production of our expresso mdu products 
our gross margin before provision for loss on purchase commitments and abandoned products on an absolute basis increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  gross margin before provision for loss on purchase commitments and abandoned products as a percentage of revenue decreased to of revenue for the year ended december   from of revenue for the year ended december   and from of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin before such provisions as a percentage of revenue in was due primarily to fourth quarter introductions of new products in the expresso mdu product line which had lower than average gross margins  increases in inventory reserves related to estimated losses on custom built products and older product versions that were not upgraded in light of fourth quarter industry slowdowns  higher costs of scarce component parts which could not be offset by further product cost reductions  and fixed manufacturing costs which could not be reduced in correlation with the rapid decline of revenue in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a charge related to provision for loss on purchase commitments and abandoned product lines of million 
the provision covers estimated costs for the cancellation of inventory purchase commitments that resulted from industry slow downs of large scale deployments in the mtu market and actual costs for inventory of abandoned product lines no longer deemed essential to our core technologies in the future 
the cost of these abandoned products was million and included onegate products  certain expresso gs line cards and routers  and certain subscriber management software 
this charge was included in cost of goods sold resulting in an overall gross margin of for the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue in from was primarily due to the change in product mix  as we sold a larger percentage of expresso products that had lower average gross margins than the xl products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense primarily consists of personnel costs  including commissions and costs related to customer support  travel  trade shows  promotions  and outside services 
our sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increases in both and were primarily due to increased hiring of sales and marketing personnel

the research and development expenses of freegate and xstreamis were consolidated with our expenses for the periods subsequent to the respective february and may acquisitions 
additionally  in we amortized million of deferred compensation and notes receivable to research and development related to restricted stock granted to certain freegate and oneworld employees 
approximately million of the remaining deferred compensation and notes receivable have been recorded as a reduction of equity in the balance sheet 
we intend to recognize the expense ratably over the remaining period in which the restrictions lapse  currently estimated at eight and ten months for each of freegate and oneworld  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to further development of the expresso gs and expresso mdu products  development of homerun related products  enhancement of certain xl products  and continued development of the subscriber management system portion of the expresso mdu product line 
the research and development expenses of publicport and vintel were consolidated with our expenses for the periods subsequent to the respective june and november acquisitions

the value of this in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the sale of the product resulting from the completion of the in process technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a risk weighted discount rate of 
research and development costs to bring in process technology from freegate to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on the company s future results of operations or cash flows

liquidity and capital resources from our inception through january  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of preferred equity securities for an aggregate of million net of offering costs 
in january  we completed our initial public offering and issued  shares of our common stock at a price of 
we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs

in march  we completed our secondary offering and issued  shares of our common stock at a price of and we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million compared to million as of december  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december  resulted primarily from net proceeds from our secondary offering of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to stock options and employee stock purchases of million

the company adopted sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of the fasb statement no

will have a material impact on the financial reporting and related disclosures of the company 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec

fin was effective july   but certain conclusions covered specific events that occurred after either december   or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the financial statements 
additional risk factors that could affect our operating results and the market price of our stock we have a history of losses and expect future losses 
we have incurred substantial net losses and experienced negative cash flow each quarter since our inception 
we incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect that we will continue to incur losses in and we may incur losses in future periods as well 
to achieve or sustain profitability  we must increase sales of our expresso products  successfully launch our intellipop product  reduce manufacturing costs  sell excess component parts obtained as a result of canceled purchase commitments and successfully introduce enhanced versions of our existing and new products 
we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have spent substantial amounts of money on the development of our expresso products  homerun technology  intellipop product and software products 
we intend to continue increasing certain of our operating expenditures  including our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenditures 
we cannot assure you that we will generate a sufficient level of revenue to offset these expenditures  or that we will be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to respond to any unanticipated decline in revenue due to the fact that our expenditures for sales and marketing  research and development  and general administrative functions are  in the short term  relatively fixed 
our ability to increase revenue or achieve profitability in the future will primarily depend on our ability to increase sales of our expresso products  successfully launch our intellipop product  reduce manufacturing costs  sell excess component parts obtained as a result of canceled purchase commitments and successfully introduce and sell enhanced versions of our existing products and new products 
a number of factors could cause our quarterly and annual financial results to be worse than expected  which could result in a decline in our stock price 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors  some of which are outside of our control 
these factors include 
availability of capital in the network infrastructure industry  
market acceptance of our products  
competitive pressures  including pricing pressures from our partners and competitors  
the timing or cancellation of orders from  or shipments to  existing and new customers  
the timing of new product and service introductions by us  our customers  our partners or our competitors  
variations in our sales or distribution channels  
variations in the mix of products offered by us  
changes in the pricing policies of our suppliers  
the availability and cost of key components  and 
the timing of personnel hiring 
we anticipate that average selling prices for our products will decrease in the near future due to volume pricing agreements and the need to reduce relatively high levels of inventory 
in addition  we may also experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results and declines in gross margin as a result of the erosion of average selling prices for high speed data access products and services due to a number of factors  including competition and rapid technological change 
decreasing average selling prices could cause us to experience decreased revenue despite an increase in the number of units sold 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our gross margins even at the anticipated reduced levels  improve our gross margins by offering new products or increased product functionality  or offset future price declines with cost reductions 
as a result of these and other factors  it is possible that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
purchases by past customers have decreased dramatically and we must establish a new base of customers 
many of our past customers have been unable to continue to access capital and are experiencing significant financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
our largest customers accounted for of net sales for the year ended december  and of net sales for the year ended december  trigem infocomm  inc  reflex communications  inc 
and darwin networks  inc 
accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales for the year ended december  cais  inc and rycom cci  inc 
accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales in we do not expect to see similar levels of sales  if any  from the majority of these particular customers in in order to meet our revenue targets  we must establish a new customer base and increase sales to existing customers who have not been our lead customers in the past 
our strategy of targeting larger  more established customers may result in longer sales cycles and delayed revenue 
sales into larger accounts could also result in increased competition from larger and better established competitors 
we face substantial risk in launching our new intellipop product 
we are in the process of launching our new intellipop product 
risks associated with the launch include delays in shipping including software bugs  delays in product hardware and software testing  and delays in production build of the product 
the complexity of the product will require additional customer support resources 
since the product will include major software components  we plan to sell software maintenance agreements 
accordingly  revenue associated with such maintenance agreements will be deferred and recognized over the life of the underlying support 
the launch of our intellipop product may also cause customers to delay purchases of our existing products 
in addition  the introduction of a new  more complex product  coupled with a search for larger  more established customers may result in longer sales cycles and delayed revenue 
we must reduce our inventory and future purchase commitments 
changes in our business have resulted in the accumulation of a substantial inventory of finished goods and components 
we have provided for losses related to the cancellation of purchase commitments 
however  we must sell existing finished goods inventory and delay or sell finished goods inventory from future purchase commitments as well as sell component inventory resulting from deliveries on already canceled purchase commitments 
failure to decrease current and future inventory and or to sell component parts may require that we take additional charges related to slow moving or obsolete inventory and components 
if we are unable to sell a substantial amount of both the finished goods and the component inventories  our expected cash position throughout the year will be negatively impacted 
our ability to attract and retain our personnel may be negatively impacted by the drop in our stock price 
the drop in our stock price has resulted in most of our outstanding employee stock options being underwater or priced substantially above current market price 
while we currently have an offer out to the majority of our employees to cancel their existing options and have such options reissued at a date at least six months and two days later than the date of cancellation  the effectiveness of such a plan cannot be predicted 
accounting and other regulatory concerns will prevent or limit our ability to issue additional stock options to these employees during the period between cancellation and reissuance 
if certain market conditions persist  the attractiveness of our stock option offerings and the success of our employee stock plans may be negatively impacted and as a result diminish our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
changes in capital markets may negatively impact our business 
due to recent changes in the capital markets including increased volatility in equity markets and tightening of lending in the credit markets  we believe that we are exposed to a greater risk that customers will alter their payment practices to conserve capital 
these changes may lead to increases in outstanding accounts receivable  longer payback periods and increased risk of default 
for example  we increased our provisions recorded on past due accounts receivable from several key customers who  during the latter part of the fourth quarter of  experienced a rapid deterioration in their ability to obtain additional capital to fund their business models  declared their inability to make timely payments on their accounts  and  as of the date of this report  have not been able to demonstrate wherewithal to pay their existing account balances 
two of these customers have filed bankruptcy proceedings 
these increased risks will be considered when assessing our customers wherewithal to pay and will likely result in longer revenue deferrals than previously experienced 
we also believe that certain of our customers will alter their deployment plans to meet the constraints imposed by changes in the capital markets 
if we are not able to increase sales to other customer segments and or sales are otherwise delayed  we may experience volatility in expected sales growth patterns which would increase the risk of declining sales growth in any particular quarter 
difficulties in forecasting product sales could negatively impact our business 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
orders for our products  however  may vary from quarter to quarter 
in some circumstances  customers may delay purchasing our current products in favor of next generation products 
in addition  our new products are generally subject to technical evaluations that typically last to days  in the case of intellipop  those evaluations may increase to six months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our revenue for that quarter would be reduced 
if we have lower revenue in a quarter than expected  we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response to this shortfall and reduced revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations for that quarter 
further  we purchase components and contract manufacture our products based on forecasts of sales 
if orders for products exceed our forecasts  we may have difficulty meeting customers orders in a timely manner  which could damage our reputation or result in lost sales 
conversely  if orders are less than our forecasts  we may have difficulty in canceling future purchase commitments in a timely manner which may result in greater than expected inventory levels and exposure to losses related to slow moving and obsolete inventory 
we depend on contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our products and rely upon them to deliver high quality products in a timely manner 
we do not manufacture our products 
we rely on contract manufacturers to assemble  test and package our products 
we cannot assure you that these contract manufacturers and suppliers will be able to meet our future requirements for manufactured products  components and subassemblies 
any interruption in the operations of one or more of these contract manufacturers would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
we also intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of a current contract manufacturer would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill customer orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we have canceled certain finished goods and component orders which may have a negative impact on our ability to diversify our product manufacturing across a larger base of contract manufactures 
in addition  our inability to accurately forecast the actual demand for our products could result in supply  manufacturing or testing capacity constraints 
these constraints could result in delays in the delivery of our products or the loss of existing or potential customers  either of which could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
we currently purchase all of our raw materials and components used in our products through our contract manufacturers 
components are purchased pursuant to purchase orders based on forecasts  but neither we nor our contract manufacturers have any guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers 
the availability of many of these components is dependent in part on our ability to provide our contract manufacturers and their suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future needs 
if we or our manufacturers were unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays and reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  any increases in component costs that are passed on to our customers could reduce demand for our products 
we rely on third parties to test substantially all of our products and a failure to adequately control quality could harm our business 
substantially all of our products are assembled and tested by our contract manufacturers 
although we perform random spot testing on manufactured products  we rely on our contract manufacturers for assembly and primary testing of our products 
any quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
moreover  defects in products that are not discovered in the quality assurance process could damage customer relationships and result in product returns or liability claims  each of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we purchase several key components from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs 
we currently purchase all of the raw materials and components used in our products through our contract manufacturers 
in procuring components  our contract manufacturers rely on some suppliers that are the sole source of those components  and we are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
for example  all of the field programmable gate array supplies used in our products are purchased from xilinx and the switching integrated circuit supplies used in the majority of our products are purchased from texas instruments 
our products are also dependent on various sole source offerings from dallas semiconductor  metalink us  motorola  flextronics semiconductor  saronix  siemens and wind river systems 
if there is any interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from a single or limited source  obtaining these components from other sources could take a substantial period of time which could cause us to redesign our products or could disrupt our operations and harm our business in any given period 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and if we do not address these changes  our products will become obsolete  harming our business and ability to compete 
the markets for high speed data access products are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements and evolving industry standards 
in addition  the market for high speed data access products is dependent in large part on the increased use of the internet 
issues concerning the use of the internet  including security  lost or delayed packets  and quality of service  may negatively affect the development of the market for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond quickly and effectively to technological change 
if we do not address these technological changes and challenges by regularly introducing new products  our product line will become obsolete  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance 
we must also continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products  particularly in response to competitive product offerings 
to remain competitive we need to introduce products in a timely manner that incorporate or are compatible with these new technologies as they emerge 
we may have only a limited amount of time to penetrate certain markets and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
any delay in product introduction could adversely affect our ability to compete and cause our operating results to be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in addition  when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer purchasing our existing products 
these actions could harm our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
our success depends on continued market acceptance of our expresso products and the successful launch of our intellipop product 
we must devote a substantial amount of human and capital resources in order to maintain commercial acceptance of our expresso products and to expand offerings of the expresso product line and the launch of our intellipop product in the mdu and mcu markets and to further penetrate these markets 
historically  the majority of our expresso products have been sold into the mdu market 
our future success depends on the ability to continue to penetrate this market and to expand our penetration into the mcu market 
our success also depends on our ability to educate existing and potential customers and end users about the benefits of our fast copper technology  including homerun and longrun  and our intellipop product and about the development of new products to meet changing and expanding demands of service providers  mtu owners and corporate customers 
the success of our expresso and intellipop products will also depend on the ability of our service provider customers to market and sell high speed data services to end users 
we cannot assure you that our intellipop or our expresso products will achieve or maintain broad commercial acceptance within the mdu market  mcu market  or in any other market we enter 
the market in which we operate is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for multi service broadband access systems is intensely competitive and we expect that this market will become increasingly competitive in the future 
our most immediate competitors include cisco  copper mountain  elastic networks  paradyne and a number of other public and private companies 
many of these competitors are offering or may offer technologies and services that directly compete with some or all of our high speed access products and related software products 
in addition  the market in which we compete is characterized by increasing consolidation  and we cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect us or our competitors 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do and we can give you no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in our target markets 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we can 
in addition  our homerun licensees may sell products based on our homerun technology to our competitors or potential competitors 
this licensing may cause an erosion in the potential market for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully 
this competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our copper wire based solutions face severe competition from other technologies and the commercial acceptance of any competing solutions could harm our business and ability to compete 
the market for high speed data access products and services is characterized by several competing technologies  including fiber optic cables  coaxial cables  satellites and other wireless facilities 
these competing solutions provide fast access  high reliability and are cost effective for some users 
because many of our products are based on the use of copper telephone wire  and because there are physical limits to the speed and distance over which data can be transmitted over this wire  our products may not be a viable solution for customers requiring service at performance levels beyond the current limits of copper telephone wire 
to the extent that telecommunications service providers choose to install fiber optic cable or other transmission media in the last mile  or to the extent that homes and businesses install other transmission media within buildings  we expect that demand for our products that are based on copper telephone wires will decline 
commercial acceptance of any one of these competing solutions or any technological advancement or product introduction that provides faster access  greater reliability  increased cost effectiveness or other advantages over technologies that utilize existing telephone copper wires could decrease the demand for our products and reduce average selling prices and gross margins associated with our products 
the occurrence of any one or more of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing or design defects in our products could harm our reputation and business 
any defect or deficiency in our products could reduce the functionality  effectiveness or marketability of our products 
these defects or deficiencies could cause orders for our products to be canceled or delayed  reduce revenue  or render our product designs obsolete 
in that event  we would be required to devote substantial financial and other resources for a significant period of time in order to develop new product designs 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in addressing any manufacturing or design defects in our products or in developing new product designs in a timely manner  if at all 
any of these events  individually or in the aggregate  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changing industry standards may reduce the demand for our products  which will harm our business 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that address changing industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards  whether through adoption by official standards committees or widespread use by telephone companies or other service providers  could require redesign of our products 
if these standards become widespread and our products are not in compliance  our customers and potential customers may not purchase our products  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the rapid development of new standards increases the risk that competitors could develop products that make our products obsolete 
any failure by us to develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  selection of competing technologies as standards by standards setting bodies such as the homepna could negatively affect our reputation in the market regardless of whether our products are standard compliant or demand for our products does not decline 
this selection could be interpreted by the press and others as having a negative impact on our business which could negatively impact the market price of our stock 
we may not be able to effectively integrate our recent acquisitions into our existing business 
in february  we acquired freegate  in may  we acquired xstreamis and in january  we acquired activetelco 
we will need to overcome significant issues in order to realize any benefits from these transactions 
these issues include 
integrating the operations of the geographically dispersed businesses acquired into our own operations  
incorporating acquired technology  rights and products into our products and services  
developing new products and services that utilize the assets of all entities  
the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of our management  and 
the potential impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers and customers 
we may engage in future acquisitions of companies  technologies or products and the failure to integrate any future acquisitions could harm our business 
as a part of our business strategy  we expect to make additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  complementary companies  products or technologies 
any future acquisitions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies 
these risks include 
difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  
diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  
the potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services  
additional expense associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets  
maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and 
impairment of existing relationships with employees  suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any business  products  technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
failure to effectively manage operations in light of our changing revenue base will adversely affect our business in the past  we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and anticipate that  in the future  expansion in certain areas of our business may be required to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities 
in particular  we expect to face numerous challenges in the implementation of our business strategy to focus on the larger  more established customers such as ilecs and ptts in both domestic and international markets 
in addition  the volatility in our business has placed a significant strain on our managerial and operational resources 
for example  in january we cut our workforce by in an effort to control overall operating expenses in response to recent declines in and expected slowing of our sales growth 
to exploit the market for our products  we must develop new and enhanced products while implementing and managing effective planning and operating processes 
to manage our operations  we must  among other things  continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  hire and train additional qualified personnel  continue to expand and upgrade core technologies and effectively manage multiple relationships with various customers  suppliers and other third parties 
we cannot assure you that our systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to exploit fully the market for our products or systems 
if we are unable to manage our operations effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our revenue  which could subject our business to a number of risks 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including 
longer receivables collection periods  
increased exposure to bad debt write offs  
risk of political and economic instability  
difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
import or export licensing requirements  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and 
currency fluctuations 
we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
however  we can give you no assurance that foreign markets for our products will not develop more slowly than currently anticipated 
any failure to increase sales to customers outside of the united states could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also expend product development and other resources in order to meet regulatory and technical requirements of foreign countries 
we are depending on sales of our products in these foreign markets in order to recoup the costs associated with developing products for these markets 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may harm our business 
all of our foreign sales are invoiced in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive for international customers and reduce demand for our products 
we anticipate that foreign sales will generally continue to be invoiced in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we expand our current international operations  we may allow payment in foreign currencies and  as a result  exposure to foreign currency transaction losses may increase 
to reduce this exposure  we may purchase forward foreign exchange contracts or use other hedging strategies 
however  we cannot assure you that any currency hedging strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  or if others use our proprietary technology without authorization  our competitive position may suffer 
our future success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secrets laws and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology 
we currently hold united states patents and have united states patent applications pending 
however  we cannot assure you that patents will be issued with respect to pending or future patent applications or that our patents will be upheld as valid or will prevent the development of competitive products or that any actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  resellers  customers and potential customers  strictly limit access to and distribution of our software  and further limit the disclosure and use of other of our proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology 
we also cannot assure you that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could harm our business and ability to compete 
we are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to our current or future products 
any such assertion  regardless of its merit  could require us to pay damages or settlement amounts and could require us to develop non infringing technology or acquire licenses to the technology that is the subject of asserted infringement 
this litigation or potential litigation could result in product delays  increased costs or both 
in addition  the cost of any litigation and the resulting distraction of our management resources could harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we also cannot assure you that any licenses of technology necessary for our business will be available or that  if available  these licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
our failure to obtain these licenses could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our products do not comply with complex government regulations  our products may not be sold  preventing us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability 
we and our customers are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission 
the fcc has issued regulations that set installation and equipment standards for communications systems 
our products are also required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  certain of our products must be certified by underwriters laboratories in order to meet federal safety requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
in addition  certain products must be network equipment building standard certified before they may be deployed by certain of our customers 
any delay in or failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
outside of the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which our products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
if we do not obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates we would not be able to sell our products where these regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or achieving profitability 
in addition  regulation of our customers may adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  fcc regulatory policies affecting the availability of data and internet services and other terms on which telecommunications companies conduct their business may impede our penetration of certain markets 
in addition  the increasing demand for communications systems has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards  generally following extensive investigation of competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process may cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers  which in turn may harm the sale of products by us to these customers 
our success is dependent on our ability to provide adequate customer support 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain current and future customers will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stage 
as our systems and products become more complex  we believe our ability to provide adequate customer support will be increasingly important to our success 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products to a diverse customer base  and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we rely on a third party for a substantial portion of our customer support functions and  we believe that the introduction of intellipop will add a significant layer of complexity to the demands on our customer support organizations 
our failure to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
failure to provide adequate support could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and relationship with our customers  could prevent us from gaining new customers and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business 
we depend on the performance of salvatore d auria  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and on other senior management and technical personnel with experience in the data communications  telecommunications and high speed data access industries 
the loss of any one of them could harm our ability to execute our business strategy 
additionally  we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to identify  hire  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  who are in great demand 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
our stock price has fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate  and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above their purchase price 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to factors such as the following 
actual or anticipated variations in operating results  
announcements of technological innovations  new products or new services by us or by our partners  competitors or customers  
changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors  
conditions or trends in the telecommunications industry  including regulatory developments  
growth of the internet  
announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  
additions or departures of key personnel  
future equity or debt offerings or our announcements of these offerings  and 
general market and general economic conditions 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the securities of internet and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations with severe drops in recent months 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these technology companies 
these market and industry factors may harm our stock price  regardless of our operating results 
our charter  bylaws  retention and change of control plans and delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and our retention and change of control plans the plans may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws and the plans could limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our charter and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  restrict our stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings  and provide for procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible financings or acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the plans provide for severance payments and accelerated option vesting in the event of termination of employment following a change of control 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws  and the plans  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law  to which we are subject  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change of control and prevent changes in our management 
future sales of our common stock could depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the appearance that these shares are available for sale  could harm the market price of our common stock 
these sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had  shares outstanding 
of these shares   shares of common stock are currently available for sale in the public market  some of which are subject to volume and other limitations under securities laws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain held to maturity securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of interest sensitive financial instruments at december  at december   we held an investment in commercial paper issued by southern california edison company 
this investment is included in short term investments at a carrying value of approximately million which matured in january and is currently in default 
we believe that the fair value of this investment has declined since the balance sheet date  however  the ultimate amount of the decline and the net realizable value of this investment is not currently practicably determinable 
we have no investments  nor are any significant sales  expenses  or other financial items denominated in foreign country currencies 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  reduce the demand for our products
