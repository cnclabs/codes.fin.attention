results of operations vs 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  all earnings per share amounts are diluted 
for the year ended december  revenue was million  an increase of million compared to operating income was million  an increase of million  compared to net income was million per share compared to a net income million per share in results for include non recurring charges resulting from the mfa acquisition which reduced net income by million 
per share 
acquisition program the acquisition of mfa  the acquisitions by ipd and ahd  and the financing required to complete the acquisitions affect most comparisons of results to the company has integrated the operations of the acquisitions and mfa within the respective divisional operations 
the mfa acquisition has been integrated to a greater extent because its assets  operations and personnel were immediately absorbed in existing ahd legal entities 
as a result the full incremental impact of the acquisitions is impractical to segregate 
the company estimates acquisitions contributed revenues of approximately million  in the year ended december  revenues revenues increased in the human pharmaceuticals business by million and in the animal pharmaceuticals business by million 
the aggregate increase in revenues was reduced by approximately million due to changes in exchange rates used in translating sales in foreign currencies into the us dollar  primarily in ipd 
changes in revenue and major components of change for each division in the year ended december  compared to december  are as follows revenues in ipd increased by million due primarily to the acquisitions approximately million and to a lesser extent higher pricing in the uk the increases were offset substantially by effects of currency translation million and lower volume in certain markets 
the pricing in the uk market was higher relative to the first half of  but was lower in the second half of compared to the second half of uk revenues grew in primarily as a result of higher pricing due in large part to unusual conditions affecting the market which abated during the second quarter of effective august  the uk government has adopted interim maximum pricing legislation 
the government has indicated that it will review the interim legislation within the next to months 
market conditions resulted in certain lower prices commencing in the second quarter of and further reductions as a result of the adoption of the above noted legislation have occurred in the second half of and are expected to continue in us pharmaceutical uspd revenues increased million due to volume increases in new and existing products offset in part by lower net pricing 
revenues in fcd increased by million due mainly to volume increases being partially offset by translation of sales in local currency into the us dollar 
ahd revenues increased million due to acquisitions primarily mfa million 
offsetting acquisition increases  adverse market and competitive conditions in a number of ahd s main markets caused volume declines and to a lesser extent price reductions in certain ongoing products 
aahd revenues declined due mainly to adverse market conditions and increased competition 
gross profit on a consolidated basis  gross profit increased to million and the gross margin percent decreased to in compared to in a major portion of the dollar increase results from the acquisitions primarily mfa and isis 
higher pricing in the ipd s united kingdom market and volume increases of a number of products in uspd also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting dollar increases were volume decreases in ahd non mfa products and certain ipd markets  lower net pricing in uspd and the effects of foreign currency translation 
in addition in the fourth quarter of  the fda made a pharmaceutical industry wide request that sale of products containing phenylpropanolamine ppa be discontinued 
the company voluntarily complied with this request and as a result  reduced gross profit by approximately million for write downs of inventory on hand and anticipated product returns 
the gross profit percent declined mainly due to the products included in the mfa acquisition which have lower gross profit percents than base animal health products 
in addition  ahd gross profits were reduced by a million write up and subsequent write off upon sale of mfa manufactured inventory 
the write up was required by generally accepted accounting principles 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million and represented of revenues in compared to in the dollar increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions including amortization of related intangibles primarily mfa and isis 
other increases included professional and consulting expenses for strategic planning  information technology and acquisitions  and a 
million charge for severance of existing ahd employees resulting from the combining of the sales forces of mfa and ahd 
foreign currency translation reduced the dollar amount of the increase by approximately million 
the percentage reduction is the result of leveraging of incremental mfa sales on the existing ahd business infrastructure 
operating income operating income in increased by million 
the company believes the change in operating income can be approximated as follows in millions ipd uspd fcd ahd aahd unalloc total operating income acquisition charges mfa net margin improvement due to volume  new products  acquisitions and price increase in operating expenses  net translation and other operating income ahd s million net margin improvement is due primarily to the mfa acquisition offset by weakness in base product sales in a number of markets 
due to integration of the mfa business into ahd  a segregation of operating income is not practicable 
the increase in operating expense for all divisions is adjusted for the estimated impact of foreign currency translation 
interest expense other taxes interest expense increased in by million due primarily to debt incurred to finance the acquisitions and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates in other  net was million expense in  due primarily to million fees incurred as part of the million mfa bridge financing and other financing fees 
the bridge financing was committed  drawn  repaid and terminated in the second quarter 
all fees associated with the interim financing were expensed in the second quarter 
the year to date effective tax rate was in compared to in the primary reason for the lower rate is the acquisition of foreign businesses in recent years and the related restructuring of ownership of legal entities in which provided a one time benefit of million in and will allow for movement of funds between the international entities

acquisition program all comparisons of results to are affected by the company s acquisition program and the financing required to implement the program 
see chronological overview 
the acquisitions increased revenue by approximately million  gross profit by approximately million  operating expenses by approximately million  and operating income by approximately million 
estimated interest on the financings essentially offset the operating income 
the cox acquisition which was completed in may increased results both because of timing ie full year versus months in and significantly improved results in compared to the corresponding period in the change in versus due to timing resulted in increased revenue of million and operating income of million 
the operating income change includes the effect of the acquisition charges 
the company estimates cox operations in compared to the corresponding months in increased revenues by million and operating income by million 
the increase results primarily from higher pricing which resulted from conditions affecting the market which did not continue in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and legal proceedings 
revenues revenues increased in the human pharmaceuticals business by million and decreased in the animal pharmaceuticals business by million 
currency translation of international sales into us dollars was not a major factor in the increases or decreases of any business segment 
on an overall basis  the company estimates that revenues grew approximately excluding the timing effect of acquisitions  the loss of sales to the wynco joint venture and the overall effect of currency translation 
changes in revenue and major components of change for each division in the year ended december  compared to december  are as follows revenues in ipd increased by million due primarily to the acquisitions in and million aggregate increase due mainly to the cox and isis acquisitions 
the introduction of new products and price increases which were offset partially by lower volume in certain markets account for the balance of the ipd increase 
cox revenues grew in primarily due to higher pricing due in large part to conditions affecting the market which did not continue in uspd revenues increased million due to volume increases in existing and new products offset partially by lower net pricing 
revenues in fcd increased by million due mainly to volume increases in vancomycin  bacitracin and amphotericin 
ahd revenues decreased million due primarily to sales previously recorded by wade jones company now being recorded by wynco  the company s joint venture distribution company 
ie  wynco joint venture revenues are not included in the company s consolidated sales effective in january when the joint venture commenced 
the ahd revenue decrease was partially offset by increased volume in the poultry and cattle markets and one quarter of revenues from id russell acquired in september 
aahd sales were million lower due to increased competition and an inability to supply certain products from the bellevue  washington facility 
gross profit on a consolidated basis  gross profit increased million and the gross margin percent increased to in compared to in gross profit in was reduced by a million charge related to the acquisition of cox or 
a major portion of the dollar and percent increase in the company s consolidated gross profits was recorded in ipd and results from the and acquisitions particularly cox and isis 
cox increased primarily due to higher pricing and the normal isis gross profit percent is higher than the company average 
other increases are attributable to higher volume  manufacturing cost reductions and yield efficiencies in uspd and fcd and sales of new products in ipd and uspd 
partially offsetting increases were volume decreases in certain ipd markets  lower vaccine sales by aahd and lower net pricing primarily in uspd 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million and represented of revenues in compared to in a major portion of the increase is attributable to the and acquisitions which include operating expenses and amortization of intangible assets acquired 
other increases included professional and consulting fees for litigation and administrative actions to attempt to reverse the european union ban on bacitracin zinc  consulting expenses for information technology and acquisitions  expenses related to the closing of the aahd facility in bellevue  washington  and increases in compensation including severance related to management changes and incentive programs 
operating expenses in include a write off of in process research and development of million and 
million for severance related to the cox acquisition

management actions in  the company announced the decision to close or sell its leased aquatic animal health plant in bellevue  washington and terminate all employees 
all significant production has been transferred to the aahd production facility in norway 
at year end the washington plant had ceased production and the fixed assets have been written down to their net realizable value 
the result of the writedown of leasehold improvements and certain machinery and equipment and the severance of all employees is a total charge of approximately million in during  the plant s lease expired  all operations ceased and all assets were disposed while no specific actions are planned  the company believes the dynamic nature of its business may present additional opportunities to rationalize personnel functions and operations to increase efficiency and profitability 
accordingly  similar management actions may be considered in the future and could be material to the results of operations in the quarter they are announced 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company s operations during  and was not significant 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was   and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in stockholders equity in primarily reflects the issuance of common stock in resulting from the million equity offerings and net income partially offset by the currency translation adjustment 
the increase in long term debt from to was due primarily to the acquisitions 
in senior debt was paid down with a portion of the proceeds from the equity offerings 
working capital at december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the current ratio was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
balance sheet captions at year end compared to are affected by the mfa acquisition which increased amounts and foreign exchange that reduced amounts reported in us dollars 
the mfa acquisition increased the balance sheet captions by the following approximate amounts accounts receivable million  inventory million  property plant and equipment million  intangible assets million and accounts payable million 
cash flow from operations as reported was also negatively impacted by the structure of the mfa acquisition 
the mfa acquisition did not include existing mfa accounts receivable and accordingly  the increase in accounts receivable as sales were made is reflected as reduction in operating cash flow 
balance sheet captions decreased as of december  compared to december in us dollars as the functional currencies of the company s principal foreign subsidiaries  the norwegian krone  danish krone  the euro  and british pound  depreciated versus the us dollar in by approximately   and  respectively 
these decreases in balance sheet captions impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios 
the approximate decrease due to currency translation of selected captions was accounts receivable million  inventories million  accounts payable and accrued expenses million  and total stockholder s equity million 
the million decrease in stockholder s equity represents other comprehensive loss for the year and results from the strengthening of the us dollar in against all major functional currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
in  the company s capital expenditures including expenditures for a company wide erp system were million  and in the company plans to spend a greater amount than in the company has approved a number of capital projects including the purchase and construction of a ahd plant for reporcin  a product and technology acquired in and a company wide information technology project which is expected to require additional capital expenditures of over million 
in september  the company acquired a technology license and option agreement for the southern cross animal health product  reporcin 
the agreement requires additional payments as additional regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in other markets 
total additional payments of approximately million are required over the next years approximately million of which is expected over the next years if all possible country approvals are received 
at december   the company had million in cash  short term lines of credit of approximately million and approximately million available under its million credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility has several financial covenants  including an interest coverage ratio  total debt to ebitda ratio  and equity to total asset ratio 
interest on borrowings under the facility is at libor plus a margin of between 
and depending on the ratio of total debt to ebitda 
the company believes that the combination of cash on hand and from operations and funds available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to cover its currently planned operating needs and firm commitments in a portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
during  the company will consider entering into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for all or a portion of its variable debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into plain vanilla agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
an important element of the company s long term strategy is to pursue acquisitions that in general will broaden global reach and or augment product portfolios 
while no commitments exist  the company is presently considering and expects to continue its pursuit of complementary acquisitions or alliances 
in order to accomplish any individually significant acquisition or combination of acquisitions  the company may use its available cash and credit lines and  if more significant  obtain additional financing in the form of equity related securities and or borrowings 
to prepare for this possibility  the company presently has an effective shelf registration with approximately million available for either debt or equity financing 
in anticipation of further offerings  the company amended its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of class a common stock from million to million in july year the company completed its program to address its potential yk issues prior to december  and experienced no disruption of operations from yk related problems on january  or during the costs directly associated with the company s yk remediation efforts totaled approximately million 
although all systems and equipment are yk compliant and no disruptions to alpharma s operations have been experienced to date  the company will continue to monitor its internal systems and equipment and third party relationships for any yk related problems that might develop 
we do not expect any problems to develop that would have a material effect on the company s operations or results 
derivative financial instruments market risk and risk management policies the company s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management practice includes the selective use  on a limited basis  of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements 
such instruments are used for purposes other than trading 
foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
the company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations 
the company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment 
at december  the company had forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million 
the fair market value of such contracts is essentially the same as the notional amount 
all contracts expire in the first three quarters of the cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non functional currency transactions 
the change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable 
at december  the company has no interest rate agreements outstanding 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
sfas will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows
