for more information on forward looking statements  refer to the special note on forward looking statements at the front of this annual report on form k 
our products have historically centered on fax and print servers and related technologies 
starting in  our revenues have declined as competition increased  primarily with the print server products in the asia pacific region  while at the same time the internet and other networking technologies advanced 
as a result  we experienced annual operating losses beginning from fiscal through fiscal during the past three years  we have redirected our efforts to focus on server appliances and on development efforts to integrate existing and future products with the internet and emerging networking technologies 
we introduced our new products  the faxpress in february  faxpress in november  faxpress sbe in february  the faxpress in september and the officedirect family of products in the fourth quarter of through mainly the release of these enhanced products in the fax messaging family  our gross profit improved and the total cost of sales have decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  we announced and began to implement a restructuring plan  which was mostly completed in fiscal as a result  operating expenses  not including non recurring restructuring charges  were reduced from million in fiscal to million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and with the gross profit improvement  restructuring and implementing numerous other product cost reductions  we were able to report an operating profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and in each of the four quarters in fiscal additionally  increased cash management provided a positive cash flow in fiscal and improved working capital in fiscal results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net sales net sales consist of sales from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  plus extended warranty contracts  to distributors and end users 
sales of products to end users are recognized upon shipment 
sales of products to distributors who have limited stock rotation rights are also recognized upon shipment  but are reduced by our estimates of anticipated exchanges and returns  even though we require our distributors to purchase additional products of equal value for the rotated products 
revenue from the sale of extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the contracts 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline of million in net sales resulted primarily from lower sales of our print server products of million  or  mainly to customers in the asia pacific region and a slight decrease of  or  in sales of our fax server products mainly to the domestic channels 
international sales were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
lower international sales were largely due to reduced demand for our print server products in europe and asia pacific regions 
most of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars and thus could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
domestic sales were million in fiscal and were consistent with fiscal  and represented and  respectively  of total net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  two distributors and one customer accounted for approximately  and of our net sales 
in fiscal  the same two distributors and one customer accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
cost of sales  gross profit gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes cost of materials  including components  manuals  diskettes  packaging materials  assembly and shipping  as well as certain royalties 
cost of sales also includes compensation costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing operations  obsolescence and manufacturing costs and warranty expenses 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal efficiencies realized from the restructuring in fiscal and fiscal  continuous product cost reductions and outsourcing of manufacturing contributed to the improvements in gross profit in fiscal in fiscal  we also recognized million of expenses related to the disposal of obsolete inventory 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new products 
research and product development expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and represented and of net sales for those periods 
the absolute dollar amount of research and product development expense decreased in fiscal due to improved expense controls and staff reductions that occurred in fiscal research and development spending has supported existing products and the development of unified messaging server appliances 
however  we continue to be committed to the development of highly competitive new products and services through the efficient utilization of our engineering resources 
sales marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives  product promotion expenses  facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and represented and of net sales for those periods 
the reduction in expenses compared to fiscal was largely due to a reduction in personnel related costs  occupancy and other cost savings 
general administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  outside services  legal and auditing expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  or and of net sales for those periods 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal was mostly due to lower legal and personnel related costs 
restructuring and other charges amortization of intangible assets there were no restructuring and other charges recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a restructuring charge of  for expenses associated with our exit from the object fax nt product line including the disposition of excess inventory  reductions in personnel and the write off of excess office space 
this disposition is expected to reduce our operating costs in future years 
in april  we acquired the object fax nt product from tolvusamskipti hf  an icelandic corporation 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development  and  accordingly  we recorded a one time charge against earnings in the second quarter of fiscal of million  as the technology acquired had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
we also recorded intangible assets of  which were amortized over months  resulting in a  charge in fiscal in determining the amount of in process research and development  we engaged an independent valuation firm to conduct an appraisal of the acquired assets 
the intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  were valued based on estimates of future cash flows discounted to their present value at risk adjusted rates of return 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the reduction in other income reflected mostly higher translation losses from foreign currency transactions in fiscal  and higher bank and credit card processing fees offset in part by higher interest income due to changes in cash balances and interest rates 
provision for income taxes in fiscal  our provision for incomes taxes was  representing state taxes only 
our current income tax provision was offset by the utilization of our net operating loss carry forward 
in fiscal  our provision for income taxes was  representing state taxes only 
because of our net loss in fiscal  there were no federal nor substantial state income taxes recognized 
comparison of years ended december  and net sales net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the sales shortfall resulted primarily from lower sales of our main product lines  including a million decrease in print server products in asia  and our efforts to manage down the inventory in the distribution channels 
sales in fiscal had been reduced by increases in the sales return allowance of million 
international sales were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and and  respectively  of net sales 
lower international sales were the result of a reduction in general demand for our print server products in asia and increased local competition in europe 
domestic sales were million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
this reduction of million  or was chiefly due to managing down the inventory in the distribution channels 
in fiscal  two separate distributors accounted for approximately and of net sales 
in fiscal  the same distributors accounted for approximately and of net sales  respectively 
cost of sales  gross profit gross profit decreased to million  or of net sales in fiscal  from million  or of net sales in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced manufacturing overhead by  through reduction of personnel and other cost savings  but recognized million of expenses related to disposal of obsolete inventory 
research and development research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and of total net sales for those periods 
the slight reduction in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to improved expense controls 
sales marketing sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing and  respectively  of total net sales for those periods 
the expense decline in was due to a reduction in personnel  lower marketing promotion  trade show  occupancy and other cost savings 
general administrative general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  or and of net sales for those periods 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal was chiefly due to a lower allowance for doubtful accounts and overall cost savings  offset by increases in the amounts paid for administrative salaries and bonuses 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the higher interest income reflected mostly higher cash balances in fiscal provision for income taxes in fiscal  our provision for income taxes was  representing state taxes only 
because of our net loss in fiscal  there were no federal nor substantial state income taxes recognized 
in addition  the tax benefit for was entirely offset by an increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  including the benefit from our net operating loss carry forward 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of favorable tax attributes in future tax returns  we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  resulting in a non recurring  non cash charge of million 
liquidity and capital resources since our initial public offering of common stock in december  our principal source of funding has been cash from our operations  with some funding from capital equipment lease lines 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  reduced from million as of december  the reduction in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal was attributable in part to a cash settlement in early for  of a dispute with a vendor and a  investment in december for leasehold improvements in our new headquarters in morgan hill  california 
working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  improved slightly to million at december  from million at december  we have a million secured revolving line of credit with a bank  which expires in march  pursuant to which we may borrow against pledges of cash at the bank s prime rate at december  
borrowings under this line of credit agreement are collateralized by all of our assets 
we are in compliance with the terms of the agreement  and at december  had no borrowings under the line of credit 
we expect to negotiate an extension of this line of credit 
in december  as a source of capital asset financing  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a finance company for an amount up to  the amounts borrowed are subject to interest of  were repayable by december  and were partially collateralized by a certificate of deposit of  which is included as restricted cash on the accompanying balance sheet 
the loan was completely paid off as of december  the restricted cash was returned to us in february in december  as a source of capital asset financing  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a finance company for an amount of  this loan is subject to interest of and is repayable by december as of december   the future minimum payments are  as of december   net accounts receivable were million  an increase from million at december  the increase was mostly attributable to slower than expected collections 
net inventories as of december  were million  consistent with net inventories at december  due to the continued decline in sales of our print server products  we have less of the related components and finished inventory  but have increased inventory in fiscal in relation to our enhanced fax server and officedirect products 
we acquired additional property and equipment of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in property and equipment in fiscal was largely a reflection of the investment of leasehold improvements in our new headquarters  and excluded capital equipment of  purchased through an equipment lease 
in fiscal  we acquired the object fax nt product line for a total purchase price of million  including  in cash and  shares of castelle common stock 
although we believe that our existing capital resources and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital requirements at least through the next months  we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for existing and new products and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  however  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
while much of our revenue is transacted in u 
s dollars  some revenues and capital spending are transacted in pounds sterling 
these amounts are not currently material to our financial statements  therefore we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of our money market account or related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the highly liquid nature of this investment 
however  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings on this account
