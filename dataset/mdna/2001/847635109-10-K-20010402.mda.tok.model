examples of these uncertainties and risks include  but are not limited to whether our products in development will prove safe and effective  whether and when we or our strategic partners will obtain approval from the fda and corresponding foreign agencies  our need to achieve manufacturing scale up in a timely manner  and our need to provide for the efficient manufacturing of sufficient quantities of our products  the lack of immediate alternate sources of supply for some critical components of our products  our patent and intellectual property position  the need to fully develop the marketing  distribution  customer service and technical support and other functions critical to the success of our potential product lines  the effectiveness and ultimate market acceptance of our products  and the dependence on our strategic partners for funding  development assistance  clinical trials  distribution and marketing of products developed by us 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated on october   and since that date we raised capital through the sale of preferred stock  issuance of debt securities  public and private sales of common stock and funding from collaborative arrangements 
following our initial funding in early  we immediately began research and development activities with the objective of commercializing less invasive diagnostic  screening and monitoring products 
as part of our business strategy  we have established arrangements with leading medical device companies for the development  commercialization and introduction of our products 
we have entered into collaborative arrangements with respironics for our infant jaundice product  with welch allyn for our cancer detection product  with abbott for our glucose monitoring products  and with roche for our diabetes detection product 
in december  we sublicensed specified technology to and acquired a interest in fluorrx  inc  a delaware corporation formed for the purpose of developing and commercializing technology related to fluorescence spectroscopy 
at december   as a result of subsequent financings  our interest in fluorrx was 
we have a limited operating history upon which our prospects can be evaluated 
our prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry 
this industry is characterized by an increasing number of participants  intense competition and a high failure rate 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception  and  as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of about million 
to date  we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts 
we first generated revenues from product sales in  but do not have significant experience in manufacturing  marketing or selling our products 
our development efforts may not result in commercially viable products  and we may not be successful in introducing our products 
moreover  required regulatory clearances or approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  or at all 
our products may not ever gain market acceptance  and we may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
the development and commercialization of our products will require substantial development  regulatory  sales and marketing  manufacturing and other expenditures 
we expect our operating losses to continue through as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete development of our products  obtain regulatory clearances or approvals  build our marketing  sales  manufacturing and finance organizations and conduct further research and development 
the majority of our revenues and profits are expected to be derived from royalties and manufacturing profits that we will receive from abbott  roche and respironics resulting from sales of the products for which we have collaborative arrangements with each of these companies 
the royalties and manufacturing profits that we expect to receive from each of our collaborative partners depend on sales of these products 
we and our collaborative partners may not be able to sell sufficient volumes of our products to generate substantial royalties and manufacturing profits for us 
we have entered into collaborative arrangements with respironics  welch allyn  abbott and roche 
the agreements evidencing these collaborative arrangements grant a substantial amount of discretion to each collaborative partner 
if one or more of our collaborative partners were to terminate their arrangement with us  we would either need to reach agreement with a replacement collaborative partner or undertake  at our own expense  the activities previously handled by our collaborative partner 
this would require us to develop expertise we do not currently possess  would significantly increase our capital requirements and would limit the programs we could pursue 
we would likely encounter significant delays in introducing our products  and the development  manufacture and sales of our products would be adversely affected by the absence of collaborative arrangements 
results of operations comparison of and general 
loss available to common stockholders increased to about million  or 
per share  for the year ended december  from about million  or 
per share  in this increased loss was due primarily to increases in research and development expenses and administrative expenses 
we expect net losses to continue 
if we are unable to attain specified milestones under collaboration agreements  our collaborative partner may not make milestone payments under  or may terminate altogether  the agreement 
if this were to happen  future net losses would escalate rapidly because of spending increases necessary to complete research  development and clinical trials of our products  begin sales and marketing efforts and establish a manufacturing capability 
this would delay some of our product development activities 
revenues and cost of product sales 
revenues increased to about million for the year ended december  from about million in the increase was both in revenue from product sales and milestones from collaboration partners 
the primary reason product sales increased was that our bilichek product line grew to about million in revenue from collaborative agreements  which is generally in the form of milestone payments increased to about million for the year ended december  from about million in  million of the milestones were received from abbott for our continuous glucose monitoring program 
cost of product sales were about million for the year ended december   unchanged from million in all cost of sales are related to product sales 
those costs did not exceed sales revenues for the first time in  but at a relatively low margin  because we are in the early stages of product introduction and have excess capacity 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to about million for the year ended december  from about million in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases in employee costs of  costs of prototype materials of  temporary help and consulting costs of  royalty expenses of  primarily related to the initiatives in continuous glucose monitoring and cancer detection  internal and external clinical costs of  for our infant jaundice and diabetes detection products 
research and development costs increases were offset by an increase of reimbursements by our collaborative partners of  we expect research and development expenses to decrease in the future even as we expand clinical trials for our products  because we expect increased reimbursement for our continuous glucose monitoring activities 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to about  for the year ended december  from  in the increase was due primarily to increases in marketing materials of  and consulting costs for latin and south america of  sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in the future as we expand our marketing effort for this product in additional territories 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to about million for the year ended december  from about million in the increase in general and administrative expense was due to the increases in legal fees of  compensation costs of  recruiting costs of  and costs of contractual agreements of  the increase in legal fees is primarily due to expenses incurred for the altea arbitration and other activities to protect our intellectual property 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future as a result of overhead costs associated with expanded research and development activities  and continuing legal and litigation expenses 
net interest income and other expense 
net interest and other income increased to about  for the year ended december  from  in this increase results primarily from interest received on higher average cash balances in comparison of and general 
loss available to common stockholders was about million  or 
per share  for the year ended december  compared to about million  or 
per share  in these net losses were due to increases in cost of production  research and development expenses and administrative expenses 
revenues and cost of product sales 
revenues increased to about million for the year ended december  from about million in the increase was both in revenue from product sales and milestones from collaboration partners 
product sales of our bilicheck product grew to about million in revenue from collaborative agreements  which is generally in the form of milestone payments  increased to about million for the year ended december  from about  in cost of product sales were about million for the year ended december   compared to million in all cost of sales are related to product sales  and those costs exceeded sales revenues because we are in the early stages of product introduction and have excess capacity 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to about million for the year ended december  from about million in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases in prototype materials costs of  temporary help costs of  royalty expense of  primarily related to the initiatives in continuous glucose monitoring and cancer detection clinical costs of  for our infant jaundice and diabetes detection products  legal expenses of  for patent filings and patent maintenance and a reduction in reimbursed expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to about  for the year ended december  from about million in the decrease was due primarily to decreases in costs of marketing materials of  and travel costs of  related to the infant jaundice product introduction and marketing activity 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to about million for the year ended december  from about million in the increase in general and administrative expense was due to the increases in compensation expense of  and outside professional fees of  net interest income and other expense 
net interest and other income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  in this decrease results primarily from recognizing  of income in relating to the de consolidation of fluorrx and lower interest income due to lower cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of our debt and equity securities and the public sale of our common stock 
from october   our date of inception  through december   we received about million in net proceeds from sales of our debt and equity securities 
at december   we had cash of about million and working capital of about million 
we completed an initial public offering of our common stock on july   which resulted in our receipt of net proceeds of about million 
in november  we received million from our sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock to abbott in conjunction with an amendment to our agreement with abbott for research and development of our glucose monitoring technology 
after december   we received additional financing 
in january  we received million from of our sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock to abbott  and in february we received million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction 
our major cash flows in consisted of cash out flow of million from operations and  in additions to property and equipment  offset by the million of private placement financing and the million redeemable  convertible preferred financing 
in addition to funds that we expect to be provided by our collaborative partners  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our funding requirements for at least the next months 
however  these resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations to the point of commercial introduction of our glucose monitoring product 
we currently invest our excess cash balances primarily in short term  investment grade  interest bearing obligations until the funds are used in operations 
substantial capital will be required to develop our products  including completing product testing and clinical trials  obtaining all required fda and foreign regulatory approvals and clearances  beginning and scaling up manufacturing and marketing our products 
any failure of our collaborative partners to fund our development expenditures would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other matters item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure regarding market risk we have not entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments and believe our exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and other relevant market risks is not material
