the acquisition provides a larger customer base and the ability to cross sell products to both north state and abatix customers 
the increase in net sales is also a result of the stable economic conditions in the geographic regions serviced by the company s facilities

this facility had revenues of approximately  further diversification of the customer base  cross selling of products  along with the economic conditions  if maintained  should allow the company to internally grow its revenues in although the decline in sales to asbestos abatement contractors is expected to continue for the foreseeable future  sales to these contractors for the first two months of were slightly higher than the same period in the asbestos abatement industry will likely diminish over time as asbestos containing materials  last used in construction during  are removed from schools  office buildings  homes and factories 
sales to the hazardous materials remediation  industrial safety and construction tools supply markets are increasing both in absolute amounts and as a percentage of revenues to the company 
the acquisitions of keliher and north state  other potential acquisitions  additional salespeople and internal growth in these markets should decrease the dependency of the company on any single product  geographic market or on sales to the asbestos abatement industry 
in addition  the company is developing an e commerce solution to help solidify relationships with the existing customer base and expand its geographic presence

the company s gross profit margins  expressed as a percentage of sales  were approximately percent for and although overall margins are expected to remain at their current levels in  competitive pressures could negatively impact any and all efforts by the company to maintain or improve product margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses for of  increased percent over expenses of  the increase was attributable primarily to the inclusion of north state costs and increased rent due to larger facilities and higher rent rates for three distribution centers and the corporate offices 
leases on three facilities were renegotiated at the end of rental rates are higher with the new leases as a result of improved real estate conditions 
these expenses were percent of sales for and percent of sales for selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the to percent range for interest expense of  increased  from interest expense of  primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisition of north state and higher interest rates

per share in the increase in net earnings is primarily due to the higher sales volume  partially offset by the higher general and administrative costs and the increased interest expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  improved percent to  from  in the abatix operating segment net sales grew percent to  in  and the iesi operating segment net sales of  in remained constant with the prior year 
the increase in consolidated net sales was primarily the result of the acquisition of north state in june and the january acquisition of keliher 
the increase in sales resulting from these acquisitions was partially offset by a decline in sales derived from customers in oil related industries 
in addition  on april   the company closed its denver facility 
the denver facility had sales of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit for of  increased percent from gross profit of  due to an increase in sales volume

the two percent decline in gross profit margin was attributable to a change in the mix of products being sold primarily as a result of the acquisitions of keliher and north state 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to  over expenses of  the increase was due to the inclusion of north state and keliher costs  as well as costs incurred  including facilities  payroll  travel  and marketing costs  in preparation for expected growth 
in order to accommodate growth  the company relocated several of its distribution centers to larger facilities  which also included higher per square foot rental rates 
this increase in rent expense  coupled with the costs associated with efforts to further enhance customer service contributed to the higher selling  general and administrative expenses in as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were percent for as compared to percent for as a percent of sales  these expenses are higher in due to the higher operating cost structure of keliher  expenses related to the integration of north state s operations  and the costs associated with marketing initiatives to improve our internal growth rate 
the company did not incur any significant charges related to the closing of its denver facility 
other expense  net  of  increased percent from expense of  primarily due to a percent increase in interest expense 
in addition to a higher prime rate  borrowings used to finance the acquisition of north state resulted in the higher interest expense 
net earnings of  or 
per share in declined percent from net earnings of  or 
per share 
the decrease in net earnings was due to a two percent decline in profit margins combined with higher selling  general and administrative costs and increased interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital requirements historically result from the growth of its accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by increased accounts payable and accrued expenses  associated with increases in sales volume 
net cash provided by operations during of  resulted principally from the decrease in accounts receivable  the net earnings adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the decrease in inventories 
the decrease in accounts receivable is attributed to higher than normal collections and lower sales in december versus cash flow from operations for the entire year of is expected to be positive  although at any given point  it may be negative 
cash requirements for non operating activities during resulted primarily from the purchases of property and equipment 
in addition  net working capital line of credit repayments occurred primarily as a result of the net cash provided by operations 
the equipment purchases in were primarily costs associated with building the company s e commerce solution  office furniture and fixtures  warehouse equipment  and a delivery vehicle 
the development of the company s e commerce solution  which should begin beta testing in the first half of  has required a significant capital outlay 
this solution  which could cost  to implement  market and maintain in  is expected to provide customers a more efficient method of doing business with abatix and could provide some cost savings in the future  as well as expand the customer base 
in early may  the company increased its working capital line of credit at a commercial lending institution from  to  to help fund additional capital requirements resulting from the business growth and the development of its e commerce site 
the working capital line of credit agreement allows the company to borrow up to percent of the book value of eligible trade receivables plus the lesser of percent of eligible inventory or  as of march   there are advances outstanding under this credit facility of  based on the borrowing formula  the company had the capacity to borrow an additional  as of march  the company also maintains a  capital equipment credit facility providing for borrowings at percent of cost on purchases 
the advances outstanding under this credit facility as of march   were  both credit facilities are payable on demand and bear a variable rate of interest computed at the prime rate 
management believes the company s current credit facilities  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient for its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
in the event the company pursues additional acquisitions and is unable to use its common stock as payment  the company would need to negotiate with a lender to secure additional borrowings to be used to acquire another company s assets 
new accounting standards the company will adopt the reporting and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities during the first quarter of fiscal this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires the recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the company s working capital and equipment lines of credit are variable rate notes  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
based on the company s debt at december  and  an increase of basis points in the united states prime rate would have negatively impacted the company s net earnings for the years then ended by  and  respectively 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this form k are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following inability to hire and train quality people  funding of environmental related projects  general economic and commercial real estate conditions in the local markets  changes in interest rates  inability to pass on price increases to customers  unavailability of products and strong competition 
in addition  further increases in oil prices or shortages in oil supply could significantly impact the company s petroleum based products and its ability to supply those products at a reasonable price 
furthermore  lack of acceptance of our proposed e commerce solution or the impairment of goodwill resulting from the acquisitions could also cause actual results to differ materially
