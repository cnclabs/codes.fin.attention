this decrease was due  in part  to the sale of the rio bravo restaurants  which had a higher proportion of beverage sales 
management also believes that the reduction in beverage sales was due  in part  to the continuation of the overall trend toward increased awareness of responsible alcohol consumption as well as a higher rate of growth in food sales resulting from successful food promotions

loss on disposition of restaurants and equipment increased from  in to  in due primarily to the loss on the disposition of the rio bravo cantina and specialty restaurants of  which was partially offset by the gain on the sale of the philadelphia restaurants of  interest expense 
interest expense increased in compared to primarily as a result of interest associated with borrowings under our credit facilities for stock repurchases 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate  as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  was in compared to in the decrease in our overall effective tax rate in was due primarily to an increase in credits resulting from fica taxes on tips and work opportunity tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources our need for capital resources historically has resulted from the construction and acquisition of restaurants 
for the foreseeable future  this should continue to be the case 
in the past  we have obtained capital through public stock offerings  debt financing  and our ongoing operations 
income from our ongoing operations includes cash generated from company and franchise operations  credit from trade suppliers  real estate lease financing  and landlord contributions to leasehold improvements 
we have also used our common stock as consideration in the acquisition of restaurants 
in addition  we have assumed debt or issued new debt in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal year and  in we currently expect to open approximately applebee s restaurants in capital expenditures are expected to be between  and  in fiscal these expenditures will primarily be for the development of new restaurants  refurbishment and capital replacement for existing restaurants  and the enhancement of information systems 
because we expect to continue to purchase a portion of our sites  the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of leased versus owned properties 
in addition  if we open more restaurants than we currently anticipate or acquire additional restaurants  our capital requirements will increase accordingly 
our senior term loan and working capital facilities are subject to various covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require the maintenance of stipulated fixed charge  interest coverage and leverage ratios  as defined  and limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures in excess of specified amounts 
the credit agreement permits annual cash dividends of the greater of  or of consolidated net income 
in addition  in april  the credit agreement was amended to permit additional repurchases of common stock of up to  through december  we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreement 
during  and  our board of directors approved four plans to repurchase up to  of our common stock  subject to market conditions 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  in   shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  in  and  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  in for a total of  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  under these authorizations 
subsequent to december   we completed all previously authorized stock repurchase programs 
in february  our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to  of our common stock through  subject to market conditions and applicable restrictions imposed by our credit agreement 
as of december   our liquid assets totaled  these assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of  and short term investments in the amount of  the working capital deficit decreased from  as of december  to  as of december  this decrease was due primarily to increases in cash and cash equivalents and receivables as a result of the timing of our fiscal year end 
as of december    was outstanding under our working capital and line of credit facilities  and standby letters of credit totaling  were outstanding under our letter of credit facilities 
we believe that our liquid assets and cash generated from operations  combined with borrowings available under our credit facilities  will provide sufficient funds for our operating  capital and other requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
in particular  increases in food  supplies  labor and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results 
we do not believe that inflation has materially affected our operating results during the past three years 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
the federal government continues to consider an increase in the minimum wage 
several state governments have increased the minimum wage and other state governments are also discussing an increased minimum wage 
in the past  we have been able to pass along cost increases to customers through food and beverage price increases  and we will attempt to do so in the future 
we cannot guarantee  however  that all future cost increases can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without at least somewhat diminishing customer spending in our restaurants 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year adoption of these new accounting standards will result in cumulative after tax reductions in other comprehensive income of approximately  in the first quarter of forward looking statements the statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section regarding restaurant development and capital expenditures are forward looking and based on current expectations 
there are several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described 
these risks include but are not limited to the impact of intense competition in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry and our ability to control restaurant operating costs which are impacted by market changes  minimum wage and other employment laws  food costs and inflation 
if you would like to read a more detailed discussion of the principal factors that could cause actual results to be materially different  you should read our current report on form k which we filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our senior term loan bears interest at either the bank s prime rate plus or libor plus  at our option 
our working capital facility bears interest at either the bank s prime rate plus or libor plus  at our option 
the interest rate on the working capital facility is subject to change based upon our leverage ratio 
we have interest rate swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the swap agreements effectively fix the underlying three month libor interest rate on  of the senior credit facilities to rates ranging from to 
as of december   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was  this amount was comprised of  under the term loan and  under the working capital facility 
a change in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year
