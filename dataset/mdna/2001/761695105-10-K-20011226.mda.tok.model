cash balances are placed in short term investments until such time as needed

the company has consistently produced strong operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal operations 
strong operating cash flows are the result of stable operating margins and a high percentage of recurring service revenues  which require relatively low capital investment

market risks interest rates the automotive solutions portion of the business borrows money  as needed  primarily to fund business combinations 
generally the company borrows under fixed rate agreements with terms of ten years or less 
the financial services segment of the business obtains borrowings to fund the investment in finance receivables 
these fixed rate receivables generally have repayment terms of five years 
the company funds finance receivables with debt that has repayment terms consistent with the maturities of the finance receivables 
generally the company attempts to lock in the interest spread on the fixed rate finance receivables by borrowing under fixed rate agreements or using interest rate management agreements to manage variable interest rate exposure 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
because fixed rate finance receivables are primarily funded with fixed rate debt or its equivalent variable rate debt that has been fixed with interest rate swaps  management believes that a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial statements
