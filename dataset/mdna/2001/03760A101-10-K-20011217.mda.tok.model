impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment 
we were required to adopt the provisions of statement effective july   and elected to adopt statement effective october  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination completed before july  continued to be amortized prior to the adoption of statement at september   we had unamortized goodwill and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million and million  respectively  all of which is subject to the transition provisions of statements and at this time it is not practical to estimate the impact of the adoption of both statements on us 
however  any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of earnings 
on august   fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard will apply to the company effective october  the company is currently reviewing the impact of this provision 
on october   fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that replaced fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of this project were to develop one accounting model  based on the framework established in statement  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
statement requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
the provisions of statement will apply to the company effective october  the company is currently reviewing the impact of these provisions

international operations our us subsidiaries have approximately of our assets and generated approximately of our income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended september   with the balance attributable to our foreign subsidiaries 
portions of our sales  income and cash flows from both domestic and foreign subsidiaries are derived internationally 
the financial position and the results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  are measured using the local currency of the countries in which such operations are conducted and are then translated into us dollars 
while the reported income of foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partially mitigated by the fact that manufacturing costs and other expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally incurred in the same currencies in which sales are generated 
such effects of foreign currency fluctuations are also mitigated by the fact that such subsidiaries operations are conducted in numerous foreign countries and  therefore  in numerous foreign currencies 
in addition  our us export sales may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases upward or downward according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 
from time to time we may employ currency hedges to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
if currency hedges are not employed  we may be exposed to earnings volatility as a result of foreign currency fluctuations 
two foreign currency hedges aggregating million were in place as of september  the following table sets forth our domestic sales and sales outside the united states in fiscal   and  respectively 
in thousands domestic net sales    international net sales    total net sales    liquidity and capital resources as a result of the acquisition of our predecessor in and the acquisitions we completed since  we have increased the carrying value of certain tangible and intangible assets consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  our results of operations include a significant level of non cash expenses related to the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets  net of amortization  increased by approximately million in  primarily as a result of continued acquisition activity 
our capital requirements arise principally from indebtedness incurred in connection with the permanent financing for the acquisition and our subsequent refinancings  our obligation to pay rent under the sale leaseback facility as defined herein  our working capital needs  primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable  our capital expenditures  primarily related to purchases of machinery and molds  the purchase of various businesses and product lines in execution of our acquisition strategy  and the periodic expansion of physical facilities 
it is currently our intent to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy 
approximately million of cash was generated from operating activities in  an increase of million or from non cash depreciation and amortization charged against net income increased approximately million for the cash outflow resulting from the net change in working capital  net of the effects of acquisitions and divestitures  was million for  or an increase in cash flow of million  as compared to million in cash outflow for these changes are set forth in detail in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
although working capital decreased in  the increase in certain working capital accounts throughout is attributable to the higher level of business activity as reflected in our increased sales 
investing activities in used approximately million of cash 
decreased cash outflow used in investing activities as compared to resulted primarily from an decrease in net payments for businesses acquired of approximately million  and increase in the proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment of million  offset in part by an increase in capital expenditures of million  and a decrease in net payments from sds of million 
financing activities used approximately million of cash 
proceeds from long term debt relating to acquisitions of million were offset by the payments made on the revolving credit facilities in excess of proceeds of million and payments made on prior acquisition debt of million 
in addition  we paid down a further million on the term loan facilities above the results of the december refinancing and april bond issuance discussed below 
financing fees of million were paid in connection with the december refinancing and april bond issuance 
prior to the spin off  we were a party to a credit agreement the old credit agreement with the chase manhattan bank chase and certain other lenders 
on december   we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with chase and certain other lenders providing for a term loan facility of million the term loan facility due in a single payment on december   and a revolving credit facility of up to million for a period of up to five years the revolving credit facility and  together with the term loan facility  the credit facilities 
on december   we borrowed approximately million under the credit facilities and together with funds aggregating million million  the amount equal to the outstanding amounts under the old credit facilities attributable to sds on december  including accrued interest plus a cash dividend of million from sds to us  used such funds to repay all of the outstanding amounts under the old credit facilities  aggregating million including accrued interest 
on april   we issued million of unsecured senior notes in a private placement with exchange and registration rights  and in august we completed a registered exchange of the privately placed notes for similar notes that had been registered with the sec 
we used the proceeds from the issuance to repay all of our term loan facility million and a portion of our revolving credit facility 
the notes were offered at a discount of approximately million 
they will mature on april  interest is fixed at an annual rate of and is payable on april and october of each year  beginning on october  interest accrues from april  the notes are redeemable by us at any time in whole  or from time to time in part  at a price equal to the greater of i of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the applicable treasury yield as defined in the notes  the form of which is an exhibit to the related indenture dated as of april  plus basis points  plus accrued interest to the date of redemption 
these notes are guaranteed by our material us subsidiaries  which also guarantee our obligations under our bank credit facility 
on october   we issued million of senior convertible contingent debt securities codes in a private placement with registration rights 
the codes have an interest rate of subject to adjustment and also pay contingent interest under certain circumstances 
interest is payable on april and october of each year  beginning april  they will mature on october  the codes are convertible  subject to certain conditions  into apogent common stock at a price of per share  subject to adjustment 
we may redeem some or all of the codes on or after october  the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the codes outstanding on october  and on october   and  or subject to specified exceptions  upon a change of control event 
our material us subsidiaries guarantee apogent s obligations under the codes 
we used the proceeds from the issuance to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility in full  and for general corporate purposes 
we have promised to file one or more registration statements with the sec to register resales of the codes  the guarantees and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the codes by the beneficial owners thereof 
european economic monetary unit on january   eleven of the european union countries including one country in which we have material operations adopted the euro as their single currency 
at that time  a fixed exchange rate was established between the euro and the individual countries existing currencies the legacy currencies 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
following the introduction of the euro  the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries during a transition period from january  through january  beginning on january   the european central bank will issue euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
our german operating units affected by the euro conversion intend to keep their books in their respective legacy currencies through a portion of the transition period 
at this time  we do not expect euro conversions to have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 
cautionary factors this report contains various forward looking statements concerning our prospects that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of management 
we may also make forward looking statements from time to time in other reports and documents as well as oral presentations 
when used in written documents or oral statements  the words anticipate  believe  continue  estimate  goal  expect  objective  outlook and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the statements contained herein and such future statements involve or may involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  that could cause our actual results and performance to differ materially from what is expected 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referenced specifically in connection with such statements  the following factors could impact our business and financial prospects our holding company structure increases financial risks 
we are organized as a holding company  with all of our net sales generated through our subsidiaries 
approximately of our net sales and of our operating cash flow for were from foreign subsidiaries 
consequently  our operating cash flow and ability to service indebtedness depend in part upon the operating cash flow of our foreign subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of loans  dividends or otherwise 
their ability to pay dividends and make loans  advances and other payments to us depends upon statutory or other contractual restrictions that apply  which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of working capital and other assets 
our international operations pose currency and other risks 
we have significant operations outside the united states  where a significant portion of our revenue is generated 
we are therefore subject to risk factors affecting our international operations  including relevant foreign currency exchange rates  which can affect the cost of our products or the ability to sell our products in foreign markets  and the value in us dollars of sales made in foreign currencies 
our sales were reduced by million and million in and  respectively  by the impact of currency fluctuations 
other factors include our ability to obtain effective hedges against fluctuations in currency exchange rates  foreign trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws  regulations and other activities of foreign governments  agencies and similar organizations  risks associated with having major manufacturing facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the united states in several respects  including fiscal and political stability  and risks associated with an economic downturn in other countries 
in addition  world events can increase the volatility of the currency markets  and such volatility could affect our financial results 
our failure to keep pace with the technological demands of our customers or with the products and services offered by our competitors could significantly harm our business 
some of the industries served by our products are characterized by rapid technological changes and new product introductions 
some of our competitors may invest more heavily in research or product development than we do 
successful new product offerings depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to 
accurately anticipate customer needs  
innovate and develop new technologies and applications  
successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner  
price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and 
differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner and make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers  some of our products could become obsolete over time  in which case our customer relationships  revenue  and operating results would suffer 
our operating results may suffer if the industries into which we sell our products are in downward cycles 
some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical 
any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions could result in reduced demand for our products and could harm our business 
future acquisitions may not be available or may create transitional challenges 
a significant portion of our growth over the past several years has been achieved through our acquisition program 
our rate of continued growth is therefore subject to factors affecting our ability to continue pursuing our current acquisition strategy and to be successful with that strategy 
these factors include the cost of the capital required to effect our acquisition strategy  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices  competition for appropriate acquisition candidates  our ability to realize the synergies expected to result from acquisitions  our ability to retain key personnel in connection with acquisitions and the ability of our existing personnel to efficiently handle increased transitional responsibilities resulting from acquisitions 
we may incur restructuring or impairment charges that would reduce our earnings 
we have in the past and may in the future restructure some of our operations 
in such circumstances  we may take actions that would result in a charge and reduce our earnings 
these restructurings have or may be undertaken to realign our subsidiaries  eliminate duplicative functions  rationalize our operating facilities and products and reduce our staff 
these restructurings may be implemented to improve the operations of recently acquired subsidiaries as well as subsidiaries that have been part of our operations for many years 
our historical financial results as discussed in the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include special charges related to restructuring activities of approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
as a result of adjustments to prior restructuring reserves  we incurred special charges of million and million for and  respectively 
additionally  on october  we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life be tested at least annually for impairment 
this will require us to perform a transitional assessment for possible impairment as of october  we have not quantified the impact of adopting this standard 
we rely heavily upon sales to key distributors and original equipment manufacturers  and could lose sales if any of them stop doing business with us 
our three most significant distributors represent a significant portion of our revenues 
for example  sales to fisher scientific  vwr scientific  and allegiance healthcare corporation accounted for approximately   and of revenues in fiscal  respectively 
our reliance on major independent distributors for a substantial portion of our sales subjects our sales performance to volatility in demand from distributors 
we can experience volatility when distributors merge or consolidate  when inventories are not managed to end user demand  or when distributors experience softness in their sales or make alternate sourcing decisions 
we rely primarily upon the long standing and mutually beneficial nature of our relationships with our key distributors  rather than on contractual rights  to protect these relationships 
volatility in end user demand can also arise with large oem customers to whom we sell directly 
the loss of a substantial contract could adversely affect our business 
sales to our oem customers are sometimes unpredictable and wide variances sometimes occur quarter to quarter 
we could be injured by disruptions of our manufacturing operations 
we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce most of the products we sell 
any significant disruption of those operations for any reason  such as strikes  labor disputes or other labor unrest  power interruptions  fire  war  or other force majuere  could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business 
in particular  the supply of white glass  which is used in our clinical diagnostics segment s worldwide manufacturing operations  comes solely from our glass manufacturing facility in switzerland 
risks include delays encountered in connection with the periodic rebuilding of the sheet glass furnace or furnace malfunctions 
although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers  our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices 
the success of many of our products depends on the effectiveness of our patents  trademarks  and licenses to defend our intellectual property rights 
our success with many of our products depends  in part  on our ability to protect our current and future innovative products and to defend our intellectual property rights 
our subsidiaries products are sold under a variety of trademarks and trade names 
they own or license all of the trademarks and trade names we believe to be material to the operation of their businesses 
we also rely upon a combination of non disclosure and other contractual agreements and trade secret  copyright  patent  and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours 
we could be hurt by product liability claims or other litigation 
our business is subject to the risks of claims involving our products and other legal and administrative proceedings  including the expense of investigating  litigating and settling any claims 
although we currently maintain insurance against some of these risks  uninsured losses could occur 
our business is subject to regulatory risks 
our ability to continue manufacturing and selling those of our products that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration or other domestic or foreign governments or agencies is subject to a number of risks 
in the future  some of our products may be affected by the passage of stricter laws or regulations  reclassification of our products into categories subject to more stringent requirements  or the withdrawal of approvals needed to sell one or more of our products 
some of our products are affected by general levels of insurance and reimbursement 
the demand for and pricing of some of our products can be affected by changing levels of public and private health care budgets  including reimbursement by private or governmental insurance programs 
we could be harmed by the loss of key management 
the success of our operations depends in significant part upon the experience and expertise of our management team  both within apogent and in our operating subsidiaries 
any loss of these key personnel could harm our business 
our recent separation from sds poses a potential tax sharing and indemnification risk 
we recently spun off the dental businesses now owned by sds 
we and sds each agreed to indemnify the other with respect to certain indebtedness  liabilities  and obligations  including potential tax liabilities if future transactions change the tax treatment of the spin off 
our ability to collect on these indemnities from sds  if applicable  depends upon the future financial strength of sds 
we sometimes experience quarterly variations in our operating results 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results caused by a number of factors  including business and industry conditions  timing of acquisitions  distribution and oem customer issues  and other factors listed here 
all these factors make it difficult to predict operating results for any particular period 
other risks may arise 
we may be subject to risks arising from other business and investment considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings or in other publicly available written documents 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to reduce our risk from these foreign currency rate and interest rate fluctuations  we occasionally enter into various hedging transactions 
we do not anticipate material changes to our primary market risks other than fluctuations in magnitude from increased or decreased foreign currency denominated business activity or floating rate debt levels 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
foreign exchange we have  from time to time  used foreign currency options to hedge our exposure from adverse changes in foreign currency rates 
at september  we had two outstanding foreign currency options 
both options were entered into in march to hedge against the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on two notes issued in british pounds 
the options of million gbp and million gbp have maturity dates approximating those of the notes  of july  and july  respectively 
both options were priced at gbp 
these options are accounted for as a fair value hedge 
at september  we had no outstanding foreign currency options 
our foreign currency exposure exists primarily in the british pound and danish krone versus the us dollar 
hedging is accomplished by the use of foreign currency options  and the gain or loss on these options is used to offset gains or losses in the foreign currencies to which they pertain 
the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against risk that eventual cash flows from foreign activities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates and the effect of related changes on payments on long term debt denominated in foreign currencies 
recognized gains or losses on foreign currency contracts entered into to hedge long term debt are recorded as other income 
we did not enter into any other foreign currency options to hedge our exposure from operations in fiscal interest rates from time to time  we use interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to interest rate movements 
our net exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate instruments whose interest rates are determined by the prime rate as publicly announced by the chase manhattan bank and the eurodollar rate 
as of october   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
see note of the accompanying financial statements 
on december   due to the extinguishment of debt  interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges ceased to meet hedge criteria under sfas as modified by sfas the approximate fair value of the interest rate swaps on december  was million 
the company sold these interest rate swaps on december  for approximately million and realized a gain of million net of tax 
upon the sale of the interest rate swaps  the company reduced the unrealized gain recorded at october  in other comprehensive income to reflect the fair market value net of tax on the date of sale 
because these interest rate swaps were designated as a hedge against future variable rate interest payments and the extinguished debt  the gain will continue to be carried in other comprehensive income and recognized as an adjustment of yield interest expense of the credit facilities over the remaining term of the interest rate contract 
for the period december  through september  the company recognized a gain of  net of tax 
in addition to the aforementioned swaps  on september   the company entered into a securities lending agreement in which we purchased a united states treasury bond treasury with a par value of million  an interest rate of and a maturity date of august  concurrent with the purchase of the treasury  the company lent the security to an unrelated third party for a period of years 
in exchange for the loaned treasury  the company has received collateral equal to the market value of the treasury on the date of the loan  and adjusted on a weekly basis 
this securities lending transaction is related to the company s consistent hedging policy by fixing million of its floating rate debt 
for a period of five years the company is obligated to pay a rebate on the loaned collateral at an annual fixed rate of and is entitled to receive a fee for the loan of the security at a floating rate equal to libor minus 
thereafter  the company is required to pay the unrelated third party a collateral fee equal to the one week general collateral rate of interest as determined weekly in good faith by the unrelated third party  provided that such rate shall not exceed the federal funds rate in effect as of the day of determination plus and the company receives all distributions on or in respect to the treasury
