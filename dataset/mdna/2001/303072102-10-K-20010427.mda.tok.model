liquidity and capital resources general we finance our operations through credit provided by vendors and other suppliers  amounts borrowed under our million revolving credit facility and internally generated cash flow 
credit terms provided by vendors and other suppliers are usually net days 
amounts which may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility are based on a percentage of eligible inventories and receivables  as defined  outstanding from time to time  as more fully described below 
during fiscal and  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively

revolving credit facility in march  we entered into a new million revolving credit facility with a financial institution and terminated a prior revolving credit facility 
under the new revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to of our eligible inventory and of our eligible accounts receivable  as defined  up to million 
the credit facility includes a million sub facility for letters of credit 
as of february   interest on the credit facility was at the prime rate  or at our election  libor plus 
under the terms of the credit facility  the interest rate may increase or decrease subject to earnings before interest  tax obligations  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda  as defined  on a rolling four fiscal quarter basis 
accordingly  prime rate borrowings could range from prime to prime plus and libor borrowings from libor plus to libor plus 
the credit facility expires on march   subject to automatic one year renewal periods  unless terminated earlier by either party 
we are obligated to pay fees equal to per annum on the unused amount of the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on accounts receivable and inventory and requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth in the event that our borrowing availability is less than a specified amount 
at february   based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable  we were eligible to borrow million under the credit facility and had no outstanding balance 
subordinated notes in fiscal  we exchanged existing subordinated reorganization notes and junior subordinated reorganization notes for new subordinated notes and new junior subordinated notes that eliminated an estimated excess cash flow calculation previously used to determine the timing and amount of payments and provided a fixed debt payment schedule 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  we accounted for the exchange of the old notes as an extinguishment of debt  and  in connection therewith  recorded an extraordinary loss  net of tax benefit  of million 
this loss represented increases in the present value of the principal amount of the old notes and fees paid to the lenders 
the fees included the issuance of  shares of pre recapitalization common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of pre recapitalization common stock  both stated at fair market value when they were issued 
the new subordinated notes totaled million and were fully paid on december  the new junior subordinated notes are non interest bearing and are reflected on our balance sheets at the present value using a discount rate of 
as of february   the new junior subordinated notes had a face value of million and a related unamortized discount of million  resulting in a net carrying value of million 
the discount is amortized to interest expense as a non cash charge until the notes are paid in full 
we made a principal payment on the new junior subordinated notes of million during fiscal additional principal payments are scheduled on december  and december  million  on december  and december  million and a final payment on may  million 
we believe that our sources of cash  including the credit facility  will be adequate to finance our operations  capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
as of february   we had outstanding indebtedness  excluding capital leases  in the principal amount of million 
capital expenditures we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  which includes costs to open new stores  to renovate and relocate existing stores  to upgrade information systems and to renovate and expand our administrative offices 
we believe that future capital expenditures will be financed from internal cash flow 
we are currently developing a plan to relocate and expand our current distribution center in san diego  california 
this new distribution center would be approximately  to  square feet and service our west coast  arizona  nevada and new mexico markets 
it would become operational in our second quarter of fiscal as a result  we may incur additional capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately million 
we believe the capital expenditures for this facility will be financed from internal cash flow 
inflation in general  we believe that inflation has had no recent material impact on our operations and none is anticipated in the next fiscal year 
minimum wage increases we employ  both in our stores and in our corporate headquarters  a substantial number of employees who earn hourly wages near or at the minimum wage 
actions by both the federal and certain state governments have increased and may continue to increase the hourly wages that we must pay to such employees 
historically  we have mitigated such increases through policies to manage our ratio of wages to sales 
however  we can make no assurances that these measures and other steps taken will be adequate to control the impact of any hourly wage increases in the future and may have a negative impact on profitability in the future 
california utility costs in california  where we currently operate stores and which represents almost of our total store base  utility costs for electricity and natural gas have risen significantly over the past year 
these costs may continue to increase due to the actions of federal and state governments and agencies  as well as other factors beyond our control 
we have attempted to mitigate such increases through energy conservation measures and other cost cutting steps 
however  we can make no assurances that these measures and other steps taken will be adequate to control the impact of these utility cost increases in the future  nor can we make assurances as to what impact these utility cost increases may have on our sales related to our core customer base in california 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations we have historically realized our highest levels of sales and income during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the quarters ending in october and january as a result of the back to school august and september and holiday november and december seasons 
the seasonally lower sales in our first two quarters february through july  can result in losses during those quarters  even in years in which we will have full year profits 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
fin clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  with respect to the definition of an employee and accounting for modifications of outstanding awards 
this interpretation became effective july  we have applied fin to all new stock options or awards granted after july  and any modifications to existing options or awards performed after july  we believe the implementation of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab was amended by sab no 
b  which defers the effective date for all registrants with fiscal years that begin after december  to allow for the option of implementing no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal we have reviewed the impact of sab nos 
and b on our financial statements and its adoption does not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement was amended by sfas nos 
and  which defer the effective date to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and clarify certain provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
became effective for our first quarter of fiscal and we do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
cautionary statement for purposes of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in december  congress enacted the private securities litigation reform act of the act contains amendments to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of which provide protection from liability in private lawsuits for forward looking statements made by specified persons 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
certain statements in this annual report on form k  or in documents incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k  are forward looking statements 
those forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ from the results anticipated by the forward looking statements 
factors which may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated by forward looking statements include  among others  general economic and business conditions both nationally and in the regions in which we operate  government regulations including regulations regarding temporary immigration of agricultural works and minimum wages of agricultural and other workers  claims asserted against us  competition  changes in our business strategy or development plans  difficulties attracting and retaining qualified personnel  the inability to obtain adequate quantities of merchandise at favorable prices  and the other factors described in this annual report on form k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate debt obligations 
at february   fixed rate debt obligations totaled approximately million 
the fixed rate debt obligations are non interest bearing and are discounted at a rate of  resulting in a net carrying value of million 
maturities are million  million  million  million and million in fiscal    and  respectively 
while generally an increase in market interest rates will decrease the value of this debt  and decreases in rates will have the opposite effect  we are unable to estimate the impact that interest rate changes will have on the value of this debt as there is no active public market for the debt and we are unable to determine the market interest rate at which alternate financing would have been available at february
