item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the group owns two separate vehicle rental companies  dollar and thrifty 
they engage in the business of renting vehicles directly to retail and tour customers and providing vehicle leasing and other services to franchisees that rent to customers 
the majority of dollar s revenue is derived from renting vehicles to customers from company owned stores  while the majority of thrifty s revenue is generated from leasing vehicles and providing services to franchisees 
the group s revenues consist of o vehicle rentals revenue generated from renting vehicles to customers  including all related charges  through company owned stores  o vehicle leasing revenue generated from leasing vehicles to franchisees  o fees and services revenue generated from franchise fees and providing reservations  insurance  supplies and other products and services to franchisees  and o other revenue generated from franchise sales  parking income  non vehicle lease income and interest income derived from franchisees 
the group s expenses consist of o direct vehicle and operating costs related to the rental of revenue earning vehicles to customers and to the leasing of vehicles to franchisees  such as field personnel expenses  facility expenses  concessions and commissions paid to airport authorities  travel agencies and others  insurance and lease promotion expenses  net of certain incentives received from vehicle manufacturers  o vehicle depreciation and lease charges  net depreciation expense relating to revenue earning vehicles  net of gains and losses on the disposal of such vehicles  and lease charges for vehicles leased from third parties  o selling  general and administrative expenses  including headquarters personnel expenses  advertising and marketing expenses and reservation expenses  o interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest earned on restricted cash  cash and cash equivalents  relating primarily to revenue earning vehicle financing  and o amortization of cost in excess of net assets acquired 
the group s profitability is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of rental transactions  utilization of the vehicles and the number of vehicles leased to franchisees 
significant changes in the purchase or disposal price of vehicles or interest rates can also have a significant effect on the group s profitability  depending on the ability of the group to adjust the size of the fleet as well as pricing and lease rates for these changes
