selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of medical service revenues amounted to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
although operations of new centers result in additional revenues  while they are in the developmental stage their operating results adversely affect results of operations 
as a result of having centers in the developmental stage which have not achieved a sufficient patient count to sustain profitable operations  we have continued to experience operational losses 
interest expense increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year primarily as a result of additional equipment financing agreements 
compared to medical service revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects increased revenues of our pennsylvania dialysis centers of approximately  including increased revenues of approximately  for our dialysis center located in chambersburg  pennsylvania  which commenced operations in january   and increased revenues of approximately  for our manahawkin  new jersey center  which received regulatory approval in december  although the operations of new centers have resulted in additional revenues  they are still in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results will adversely affect our results of operations until they achieve a sufficient patient count to cover fixed operating costs 
interest and other income decreased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this decrease is largely due to a decrease in interest earned as a result of a decrease in invested funds 
cost of medical services sales as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in  reflecting an increase in supply costs as a percentage of sales and a decrease in healthcare salaries as a percentage of sales

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of medical services revenue amounted to for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year 
as a result of having centers in the developmental stage  which have not achieved a sufficient patient count to sustain profitable operations  we have continued to experience operational losses 
interest expense decreased by approximately  during the comparable periods largely as a result of reduced average outstanding borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources working capital totaled  at december   which reflected a decrease of approximately  during the current year 
included in the changes in components of working capital was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  which included net cash used in operating activities of  net cash used in investing activities of  including  loans to our parent  a  loan to mainstreet  additions to property and equipment of  primarily related to new centers  including  for purchase of land and construction of a building for our new valdosta  georgia center  and  proceeds from the sale of minority interest in subsidiaries  and net cash provided by financing activities of  including advances to our parent of  debt repayments of  borrowings of  on our vineland  new jersey development loan  and net proceeds from option and warrant exercises of 
the change in working capital reflected increases of approximately  in accounts receivable and  in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased sales activity 
we have mortgages on two of our buildings  one in lemoyne  pennsylvania and the other in easton  maryland  with first mortgages having a combined balance of approximately  at december   and  at december  in  we were in default of certain covenants relating to these mortgages 
the covenants principally related to debt service ratio requirements and rent cap requirements for which the bank has waived compliance 
the bank has liens on our real and personal property  including a lien on all rents due and security deposits from the rental of these properties 
an unaffiliated competitive maryland dialysis center continues to lease space from us in our building 
the maryland property has a second mortgage to secure a three year  loan to our vineland  new jersey subsidiary  which loan is guaranteed by the company and secured by that subsidiary s personal property exclusive of its dialysis equipment

we have an equipment financing agreement for kidney dialysis machines for our facilities  which has an outstanding balance of approximately  at december   and  at december  this included additional equipment financing of approximately  during see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we opened our sixth center in vineland  new jersey in february   and our seventh and eighth centers in georgia in november   and a center in ohio which we manage and in which we hold a minority interest  which opened in february  capital is needed primarily for the development of outpatient dialysis centers 
the construction of a station facility  typically the size of our dialysis facilities  costs in the range of  to  depending on location  size and related services to be provided  which includes equipment and initial working capital requirements 
acquisition of an existing dialysis facility is more expensive than construction  although acquisition would provide us with an immediate ongoing operation  which most likely would be generating income 
we presently plan to expand our operations through construction of new centers  rather than acquisition 
development of a dialysis facility to initiate operations takes four to six months and usually months or longer to generate income 
we consider four of our centers to be in the developmental stage  since they have not developed a patient base sufficient to generate and sustain earnings 
two of these centers were recently established  homerville  georgia november  and ohio february  
the two other developmental stage centers have been operational as of december   for approximately months manahawkin  new jersey and months carlisle  pennsylvania 
we are seeking to expand our outpatient dialysis treatment facilities and inpatient dialysis care 
such expansion requires capital 
we are presently in different phases of negotiations with physicians for additional outpatient centers 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy or that financing will be available to support such expansion

in january  we loaned  to our parent  medicore  inc  at an annual interest rate of  with the loan and accrued interest originally scheduled to be repaid on january  our parent utilized this loan to fund a loan by it to linux global partners  which invests in linux software companies  in conjunction with which our parent acquired a ownership interest in linux  which increased to in march   in conjunction with our parent borrowing an additional  from us on the same terms as the original loan to fund a loan of the same amount to linux global partners 
on august   our parent borrowed an additional  at interest  which additional funds it loaned to linux global partners on the same terms 
medicore extended the maturity of the loans to linux global partners to june  for additional consideration from linux global partners 
the maturity of the company s loans to the parent have been similarly extended

see item  certain relationships and related transactions 
in july   the company loaned  to mainstreet  a private company with whom we had a proposed merger transaction  which was subsequently terminated  pursuant to a one year secured convertible promissory note 
mainstreet defaulted in payment of that note on november   resulting in the company obtaining  shares of linux global partners  the collateral securing the mainstreet loan 
see item  certain relationships and related transactions and notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september   the company announced its intent to repurchase up to approximately  of its outstanding shares 
approximately  shares were repurchased for cancellation at a cost of  in the fourth quarter of see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current levels of working capital and available financing alternative will enable us to meet our liquidity demands for at least the next twelve months as well as expand our dialysis facilities and thereby our patient base 
new accounting pronouncement in june   the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires  among other things  that all derivatives be reorganized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and that these instruments be measured at fair value 
we are in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of fas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
due to the company s limited use of derivative financial instruments  the adoption of fas is not expected to have a significant effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
proposed merger and acquisition on october   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which mainstreet would merge with and ultimately own of our company 
the proposed merger was terminated in august  see note to notes to consolidated condensed financial statements 
impact of inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is subject to reimbursement rates established and regulated by the federal government 
these rates do not automatically adjust for inflation 
any rate adjustments relate to legislation and executive and congressional budget demands  and have little to do with the actual cost of doing business 
see operations medicare reimbursement and government regulation under item  business 
therefore  dialysis services revenues cannot be voluntary increased to keep pace with increases in nursing and other patient care costs 
increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not consider our exposure to market risks  principally changes in interest rates  to be significant 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities of which we held approximately  at december  interest rate risk on debt is managed by negotiation of appropriate rates for equipment financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate mortgage obligations which totaled  at december  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on our year end investments in government securities and a increase in rates on our year end mortgage debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our results of operations 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently use interest rate derivatives
