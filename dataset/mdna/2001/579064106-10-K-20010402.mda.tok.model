the increase in net revenue from to is due to increases in new customer purchases and increases in customer renewals of product licenses  as well as continued acceptance of our support services 
in addition  the increase also reflects positive results from our recent reorganization into four product groups  with four separate sales groups focused on selling their respective products 
the overall increase in net revenue in occurred despite the adverse impact in the fourth quarter of our decision to transition to a sell through model  which resulted in some of our distribution partners reducing their inventory levels  as described below 
the decrease in net revenue from to is due to our decision to limit distributor orders in an effort to realign channel inventory levels as a result of year concerns and increasing sales cycles for our products 
in december  in light of the business decision by some of our distributors  including our largest distributor  to reduce inventory levels  and due to the unpredictability of demand in the distribution channel  we began a transition from a sell in to a sell through business model 
results reported for the quarter and year ended december   include a significant reduction to net revenue due to some our distribution partners business decision to reduce their inventory levels by not replenishing their inventory and requesting returns over and above their contractual rights 
we expect to complete our transition to the sell through model in the first quarter of product revenue includes revenue from product licenses and hardware 
product revenue increased to million in from million in product revenue decreased to million in from million in the increase in product revenue from to is due to increases in new customer purchases and positive results from our recent reorganization into four product groups  with four separate sales groups focused on selling their respective products 
services and support revenues include revenues from software support and maintenance contracts  education and consulting services  which are deferred and recognized over the related service period 
service revenues increased to million in from million in service revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in services and support revenues resulted from growth in all categories of service revenues  principally due to the growth of our installed customer base and the resulting renewal of support and maintenance contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by increased price competition  a maturing anti virus market and an increasingly higher revenue base from which to grow 
our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of existing orders as well as expanding our customer base 
if our renewal rate or our pace of new customers slows  our net revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 
international revenue accounted for approximately   and  of net revenue for   and  respectively 
the decrease in international net revenue as a percentage of net revenue from to was due to under performance in sales operations  changes in sales management  a slow down due to softening market conditions  and continued weakness of the euro 
to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  we use non leveraged forward currency contracts 
however  our future results of operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations or by costs associated with currency risk management strategies 
other risks inherent in international revenue include the impact of longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  seasonality due to the slowdown in european business activity during the third quarter  tariffs and other trade barriers  uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstance  political instability in emerging markets and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international license revenue 
further  in countries with a high incidence of software piracy  we may experience a higher rate of piracy of our products 
cost of net revenue 
cost of net revenue increased to million in to million in  and decreased from million in the increase in cost of net revenues from to was primarily due to the increase in net revenue 
from to  the decrease in cost of net revenues was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue 
our cost of product revenue consists primarily of the cost of media  manuals and packaging for products distributed through traditional channels  royalties  and with respect to hardware based sniffer and e ppliance products  computer platforms and other hardware components 
cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in from to  cost of product revenues decreased from million in the increase in product cost of revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in product revenues 
the decrease in cost of product revenues from to was primarily due to a corresponding decrease in product revenues 
as a percentage of net product revenue  cost of product revenue was in  in  and in cost of services and support revenue consists principally of salaries and benefits related to employees providing customer support and consulting services 
in  the cost of services and support revenue increased to million from million in from to  cost of services and support revenue decreased to million from million in costs remained relatively flat in and cost of services and support revenue as a percentage of net services and support revenue was in  in  and in to the extent that the percentage of our net revenue  which is generated through traditional distribution channels  increases  our cost of net revenue will increase 
in future periods  we expect that cost of product revenue will increase in absolute terms and as a percentage of net revenue in conjunction with an expected increase in the number of hardware based products sold by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for our development and technical support staff 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively  research and development expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased from to due to the increase in staffing and equipment expense to support growth in our product and service offerings 
from to  excluding the effects of stock based compensation in  research and development expenses increased from million 
these increases were primarily due to the increase in staffing and equipment expense to support growth in our product and service offerings 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses were in  in  and in we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue 
we believe that our ability to maintain our competitiveness will depend in large part upon our ability to enhance existing products  develop and acquire new products and develop and integrate acquired products 
the market for computer software is characterized by low barriers to entry and rapid technological change  and is highly competitive with respect to timely product introductions 
the timing and amount of research and development expenses may vary significantly based upon the number of new products and significant upgrades under development and products acquired during a given period 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions and benefits for marketing  sales and customer support personnel and costs associated with advertising and promotions 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively  marketing and sales expenses increased to million from million in from to  excluding the effect of stock based compensation in  marketing and sales expenses increased from million in these increases were primarily due to continued investment in the marketing of our products and services  hiring and training of our enterprise level sales force  and advertising and promotions for mcafee

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for administrative personnel and general operating costs 
excluding the effect of stock based compensation of million and million for and  respectively  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million 
in  we recorded charges to cover million in doubtful accounts  the development of our e commerce business systems  expansion of our it infrastructure and the implementation of our new sap human resources module

from to  excluding the effects of stock based compensation in  general and administrative expenses increased from million in for the above mentioned events 
as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses were   and in the years ended december    and  respectively 
stock based compensation we expensed million and million in and  respectively 
stock based compensation charges relate to the repricing of employee stock options and the issuance of mcafee 
com stock options to our executives and employees 
we do not expect to incur charges related to these mcafee 
com option grants in this statement is forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that our actual performance will meet our current expectations 
see risk factors discussion beginning on page of this document 
the future 
however  we do expect significant stock based compensation charges related to repriced employee stock options 
on april   we offered to substantially all our employees  excluding executive officers  the right to cancel certain outstanding stock options and receive new options with exercise prices at the current fair value of the stock 
options to purchase a total of million shares were canceled and the same number of new options were granted at an exercise price of  which was based on the closing price of our common stock on april  the new options vest at the same rate that they would have vested under previous option plans 
as a result  options to purchase approximately million shares at were vested and outstanding at december  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  we recorded an initial stock based compensation charge in connection with this repricing 
this charge was calculated based on the difference between the exercise price of the new options and their market value on the date of acceptance by employees 
approximately million were expensed in the twelve months ended december   respectively 
as a result of the introduction of fin  stock options repriced by us on april  are subject to variable plan accounting treatment from july  accordingly  we have and will continue to remeasure compensation costs for the repriced options until the options are exercised  forfeited or canceled without replacement 
the first valuation period began with the effective date of fin which was july  the valuation has and will be based on any excess of the closing stock price at the end of the reporting period or date of exercise  forfeiture or cancellation without replacement  if earlier  over the fair value of our common stock on july   which was 
the resulting compensation charge to earnings will be recorded over the remaining vesting period  using the accelerated method of amortization discussed in fasb interpretation no 
when options are fully vested  the charge will be recorded to earnings immediately 
depending upon movements in the market value of our common stock  this accounting treatment may result in significant additional compensation charges in future periods 
in addition  variable plan accounting as described above  applies to options issued to employees of mcafee 
com and mycio 
com as a replacement for our options which were subject to the repricing described above 
as a result  we will record variable charges based on the movements in the fair value of mcafee 
com and mycio 
com common stock from july  as a result  during  we recorded a compensation charge to earnings of approximately million 
as of december   we  mcafee 
com and mycio 
com had options  outstanding and subject to variable plan accounting  amounting to million  million  and million  respectively 
amortization of intangibles 
we expensed million  million  and million of amortization related to intangibles in the years ended december   and  respectively 
intangibles consist of purchased goodwill and certain acquired technology 
the increase in amortization in was primarily a result of the amortization of the additions to goodwill related to mcafee 
com s acquisitions during in addition  in accordance with its accounting policy our subsidiary  mcafee 
com  performed a review of the carrying of the goodwill associated with one of its acquisitions and recognized an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was recorded as a result of mcafee 
com s year end review of technology acquired in the year and an assessment of its future potential 
mcafee 
com determined that certain storage technology purchased as part of the original acquisition was not to be incorporated into future products as a result of the nonviable internet advertising business model 
accordingly the full carrying value of the unamortized goodwill and purchased technology was written off 
the increase in amortization in related to a full year of amortization of intangibles that resulted from the acquisitions of magic solutions  inc  and cybermedia 
acquisition and other related costs the following table is a summary of acquisitions by the company in the three years ended december  common stock issued in purchase price of pooling of interests purchase transactions mcafee

com completed two acquisitions for total consideration  including the issuance of approximately  of its class a common stock  valued at approximately million 
the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the total combined purchase price was approximately million  including transaction costs 
mcafee 
com analyzed the intangible assets to determine whether any amount should be recorded as in process research and development  however mcafee 
com determined that the acquired technologies and products are largely dependent on the core technology and that new versions are released frequently and contain incremental rather than fundamental improvements 
based on this analysis million was recorded as goodwill and purchased technology  and is being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
in december  in accordance with its accounting policy  mcafee 
com  performed a review of the carrying of the goodwill associated with one of it s acquisitions and recognized an impairment charge of million 
mcafee 
com performed a review of the carrying value of the goodwill as it had been assessed that mcafee 
com would not use the technology purchased as part of the original acquisition 
accordingly the full value of the unamortized goodwill was written off 
the historical operations of these acquisitions were not material to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

lease costs and asset write downs include the costs of closing approximately facilities throughout the world million  the disposal of excess and obsolete assets primarily computer equipment which did not comply with our standards million  and the write off of goodwill and intangibles associated with discontinued dr 
solomon s products million 
the dr 
solomon s write off related to two minor products which we discontinued and which had no sales subsequent to the dr 
solomon s acquisition 
the severance and benefits charges related to company wide reductions in workforce following our major acquisitions in the second and third quarters of of approximately employees of which were in research and development functions  were in sales and marketing functions and the remainder were in administrative and other support functions 
substantially all terminated employees left our employment in the period the related accounting charge was recorded 
we retained a limited number of employees from each acquisition for short transition periods 
the cost of these employees was charged to operating expenses during the transition period 
the lease costs represent an estimate of lease expense during the period prior to re leasing the property together with losses on subleases  if any 
the leased facilities were substantially vacated in the period in which the related accounting charges were recorded 
the costs related to any facilities  which we used during this period  were charged to operations 
however  these charges were not material 
asset write downs  exclusive of the intangible assets of dr 
solomon s described above  comprised million in losses on company owned buildings which were written down to estimated values and million in net losses of computer and other miscellaneous assets 
in general  this equipment was discarded or sold for nominal value 
due to the immediate consolidation of facilities  depreciation allocable to these facilities and the related assets  during the transition period  was not material 
all the facilities acquired in our acquisitions identified for closure have been disposed of or subleased as of december  the in process research and development costs comprise approximately million and million in connection with the acquisitions of cybermedia in the three months ended september  and magic solutions in the three months ended june   respectively 
the following is a summary of the projects acquired and the assumptions used in determining the value of the in process research and development costs 
cybermedia the ongoing projects at cybermedia at the time of the purchase included upgrade versions of four products first aid and  uninstaller  guard dog  and oil change as well as work on technologies to be used in two of the our projects a replacement product for pc medic and mcafee office 
these upgrades will include new interfaces with the internet  enhanced use of active x controls and java and enhanced user interfaces 
at the date we acquired cybermedia  we estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately months to complete and would cost million 
the efforts required to complete the development of these projects principally relate to additional design efforts to integrate the technologies into our line of products  finalization of coding  and completion of prototyping  verification  and testing activities required to establish that products associated with the technologies can be successfully introduced 
the value of the in process technologies was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products  including costs to complete the development of the technologies or products  and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products  excluding the value attributed to integration with our products or that may have been achieved due to efficiencies resulting from the combined sales force or the use of our more effective distribution channel 
in conformity with the sec s revised guidelines for accounting for in process technologies  these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of which represents a premium of approximately over our average weighted cost of capital and excluding the value attributable to the use of the in process technologies in future products 
as of december   the projects related to this acquisition were completed 
magic solutions the ongoing projects at magic solutions at the time of the purchase comprised an upgrade version of support magic  magic solutions current product 
this upgrade  known as merlin enterprise  represents new technologies with significant enhanced functionality  including increased scalability  a bit browser based technology  an enhanced user interface and integrated management features 
at the date we acquired magic solutions  we estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately months to complete and would cost million

as of december   the projects related to this acquisition were completed 
interest and other income 
interest and miscellaneous income increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in interest and other income increased from to due to an increase in higher average cash balances invested at slightly higher interest rates 
from to  interest income decreased due to the reduced cash balances resulting from the acquisitions of magic and cybermedia and cash used to fund operating activities during the year 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased to million in from million in and from million in interest and other expense remained flat in interest and other expense remained relatively flat from to gain loss on investments 
in  we recognized a total gain of million on the sale of our venture and strategic investments  including a gain on the sale of shares of network associates japan  amounting to million 
this gain is offset by a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain of our venture and strategic investments 
this decline was based on the likelihood that the related company would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months 
in and  we recognized a loss of million and a gain of million  respectively from sale of marketable securities 
additionally  we recognized a loss of million on the liquidation of our direct web investment 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for   and was   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in non deductible acquisition related expenses  and a decrease in foreign earnings subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to was primarily due to the losses incurred in  and a decrease in non deductible acquisition related expenses 
the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets increased from to  as well as  from to the increase was due to increased uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize certain deferred tax assets primarily foreign tax credits 
if we cease to own at least of mcafee 
com s outstanding common stock  we may be required to include in our consolidated federal taxable income an amount equal to the excess of the cumulative mcafee 
com net operating losses absorbed in our prior year consolidated tax returns over our tax basis in mcafee 
com 
as of december   there were no excess amounts 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  for a combined total of million 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net loss before depreciation and amortization  bad debt expense  stock based compensation charge  and interest on our debentures offset by deferred taxes and gain on sale of investments 
in addition  there were decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  which amounts were offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash used in operating activities in consisted primarily of net loss before depreciation and amortization  bad debt expense  stock based compensation charge  interest on our debentures  realized loss on investments  and deferred taxes 
in addition  there were decreases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which amounts were offset by a decrease in deferred revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net income before acquired in process research and development  depreciation and amortization and interest on our debentures as well as an increase in deferred revenue and the tax benefit from exercise of non qualified stock options 
increases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset these factors 
our accounts receivable balance as a percentage of sales may increase due to our increased emphasis on server enterprise based sales and expanding international sales  both of which typically have longer payment terms 
additionally  our receivable collection has become more dependent on the longer payment cycle for vars  distributors and system integrators 
to address this increase in accounts receivable and to improve cash flow  we may from time to time take actions to encourage earlier payment of receivables and sell receivables 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we will be subject to greater general credit risks with respect thereto 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  primarily reflecting purchases of marketable securities and additions to fixed assets 
in  we obtained proceeds of million and million from our sale of goto 
com shares and the sale of less than of the shares of our japanese subsidiary  network associates japan  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million in consisting primarily of the repurchase of our common stock which represented approximately million 
the repurchases of our common stock were slightly offset by proceeds associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options and the sale of put options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in consisting primarily of the proceeds from mcafee 
com s initial public offering as well as proceeds associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and consisted primarily of the proceeds associated the issuance on the debentures noted above together with proceeds from the exercise of non qualified stock options 
as discussed above  in december  in light of the business decision by some of our distributors  including our largest distributor  to reduce inventory levels and due to the unpredictability of demand in the distribution channel  we began a transition from a sell in to a sell through business model 
we expect that our transition to the sell through model will be completed in the first quarter of in addition  some of our distributors are experiencing financial difficulties worldwide 
these factors may adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable from our distributors in in february  we settled all outstanding put options for a payment of approximately million 
as discussed below  in february we may be required to use a significant portion of our cash balances to redeem our outstanding zero coupon debentures 
we believe that our available cash and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
euro on january   the euro was introduced 
on that day  the exchange ratios of the currencies of the eleven countries participating in the first phase of the european economic and monetary union were fixed 
the euro became a currency in its own right and the currencies of the participating countries  while continuing to exist for a three year transition period  are now fixed denominations of the euro 
the conversion to the euro will have significant effects on the foreign exchange markets and bond markets and is requiring significant changes in the operations and systems within the european banking industry 
our information this statement is forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that our actual performance will meet our current expectations 
see risk factors discussion beginning on page of this document 
system is designed to accommodate multi currency environments 
as a result  we have the flexibility to transact business with vendors and customers in either euro or traditional national currency units 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures related to nondollar denominated sales and operating expenses in japan  canada  australia  europe  latin america  and asia 
we have recently expanded our business activities in europe 
as a result  we expect to see an increase in exposures related to nondollar denominated sales in several european currencies 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  australian dollar  and certain european currencies 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
we also maintain minority investments in non publicly traded companies 
these investments amounting to million are carried at cost less reductions for other than temporary impairments 
reasons for reductions for other than temporary impairments include but are not limited to  decline in value as if the related company would have insufficient cash flow to operate for the next twelve months 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps over six and twelve month time horizons 
beginning fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest and dividends at december  ending fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income at six and twelve month time horizons

the initial price to the public for our debentures was per  of face amount at maturity  which equates to a yield to maturity over the term of the bonds of on a semi annual bond equivalent basis 
the debentures are convertible into common stock at the rate of shares per  of face amount at maturity  which equates to an initial conversion price of per share 
the debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness as defined in the related indenture and effectively subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the debentures may be redeemed for cash at our option beginning on february  at the option of the holder  we will purchase the debentures as of february   february  and february  at purchase prices to be paid in cash or common stock or any combination thereof and subject to certain conditions equal to the initial issue price plus the accretion of the discount on the debentures to such dates 
the debentures may also be redeemed at the option of the holder if there is a fundamental change as defined in the related indenture at a price equal to the issue price plus the accretion of the discount on the debentures to the date of redemption  subject to adjustment 
assuming that as of february  all debenture holders require that we redeem their debentures  we would be required to pay an aggregate redemption price in cash and or shares of common stock equal to approximately million 
the number of shares  if any  issued in connection with any redemption will be based on the fair value of our common stock at the time of redemption 
quarterly operating results unaudited three months ended december  september  june  march  december  september  in thousands  except per share data statements of operations and other data net revenues       gross margin       income loss from operations      income loss before provision for income taxes and minority interest       net income loss      diluted earnings loss per share shares used in per share calculation diluted       three months ended june  march  statements of operations and other data net revenues   gross margin   income loss from operations   income loss before provision for income taxes and minority interest   net income loss   diluted earnings loss per share shares used in per share calculation diluted   we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  our revenue decreased from the fourth quarter of due to some of our distribution partners business decision to reduce their inventory levels by not replenishing their inventory and requesting returns over and above their contractual rights 
our revenues and results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations  particularly on a quarterly basis  and our revenues and results of operations could fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter and year to year 
causes of such fluctuations may include the volume and timing of new orders and renewals  the sales cycle for our products  the introduction of new products  distributor inventory levels and return rates  inventory levels  product upgrades or updates by us or our competitors  changes in product mix  changes in product prices and pricing models  seasonality  trends in the computer industry  general economic conditions such as the recent economic slowdown  extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation and the occurrence of unexpected events 
significant quarterly fluctuations in revenues will cause significant fluctuations in our cash flows and the cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and deferred revenue accounts on our balance sheet 
in addition  the operating results of many software companies reflect seasonal trends  and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be affected by such trends in the future 
these trends may include higher net revenue in the fourth quarter as many customers complete annual budgetary cycles  and lower net revenue in the summer months when many businesses experience lower sales  particularly in the european market
