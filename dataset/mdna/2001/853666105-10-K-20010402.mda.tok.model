item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in  cash used in operations amounted to million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in and million in the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in inventories as compared to and  and a decrease in net earnings as compared to in connection with the aforementioned increase in inventories and the related decrease in inventory turnover x in vs 
x in the reasons are two fold 
first  with respect to the temperature control segment  and as noted elsewhere  the related business is highly seasonal with sales of air conditioning parts being greatest in the second and third quarters of the year 
this seasonality requires the build up of inventory levels prior to the main selling season 
as discussed in our comparison of the year vs 
 temperature control sales were significantly below the prior year and forecasted amounts 
although significant reductions were made to temperature control production levels in  the short fall in net sales more than off set such reductions 
second  with respect to the engine management segment  in the third quarter of  engine management successfully acquired a new major customer which required inventory levels to be increased in order to fill the initial pipeline of orders from such customer 
in addition  the customer launch for new orders has extended into  versus the fourth quarter of  as originally planned 
in order to achieve significant inventory reductions and in order to improve our working capital position  the company has continued to monitor production levels in our temperature control business and reduced production and purchasing requirements for the engine management business 
cash used in investing activities was million in  as capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
for the three years ended december   and capital expenditures totaled million  million and million  respectively 
cash used by financing activities was million in  as million of principal payments of long term debt and million in repurchases of the company s common stock more than off set borrowings of million under line of credit arrangements 
dividends paid for the three years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
in the first two quarters of the company suspended the dividend due to a deterioration in financial performance 
the dividend was reinstated in the third quarter of as the company s financial results and prospects greatly improved 
in the third quarter of  the board of directors increased the regular quarterly dividend from 
to 
per share 
on november   the company entered into a new three year revolving credit facility with eight lending institutions  providing for a  unsecured line of credit 
the facility allows the company to select from two interest rate options  one based on a spread over the prime rate and the other based on a spread over libor 
the spread above each interest rate option is determined by the company s ratio of consolidated debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the terms of the revolving credit facility included  among other provisions  the requirement for a clean down  maintenance of defined levels of tangible net worth  various financial performance ratios and restrictions on capital expenditures  dividend payments  acquisitions and additional indebtedness 
at december  the company did not comply with certain covenant requirements for which the company received waivers and amendments on march  with the revolving credit facility set to expire on november   the company is currently negotiating with potential lenders to provide for a multi year revolving credit facility 
the company is expecting to complete the placement of such a facility by april  depending on the specific financing agreement  the company may be required to repay and extinguish certain long term debt obligations  as well as incur prepayment penalties 
in addition  should a new financing agreement not be entered into prior to april   the company is obligated to provide security interests in inventory and accounts receivable to the lending institutions party to the current revolving credit facility 
in connection with the company s senior note payable  at december   the company did not comply with certain covenant requirements 
the company elected to prepay the balance on march  in connection with this prepayment  the company reflected an extraordinary loss of approximately million in the first quarter of related to prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred loan costs 
on july   the company issued convertible subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of  the debentures are convertible into approximately  shares of the company s common stock  and mature on july  the proceeds from the convertible debentures were used to prepay an senior note payable  reduce short term bank borrowings and repurchase a portion of the company s common stock 
the company sells certain accounts receivable to an independent financial institution  through its wholly owned subsidiary  smp credit corp  a qualifying special purpose corporation 
in may smp credit corp 
entered into a three year agreement whereby it can sell up to a million undivided ownership interest in a designated pool of certain of these eligible receivables 
this agreement expires in march the terms of the agreement contain restrictive covenants  including the maintenance of defined levels of tangible net worth 
at december  and  net accounts receivables amounting to  and  respectively  had been sold under this agreement 
during the years through  the board of directors authorized multiple repurchase programs under which the company could repurchase shares of its common stock 
during such years  million in aggregate of common stock has been repurchased to meet present and future requirements of the company s stock option programs and to fund the company s esop 
as of december  the company has board authorization to repurchase additional shares at a maximum cost of million 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately million  primarily for new machinery and equipment 
the company s profitability and working capital requirements have become more seasonal with the increased sales mix of temperature control products 
our working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales begin to be received 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our lines of credit 
the company anticipates that its present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet its near term needs 
comparison of to net sales in were million  a decrease of million or when compared to net sales in temperature control decreased by million primarily due to a significant retail customer achieving substantial inventory reductions  loss of a major retail customer early in the year contributed approximately million to the overall decrease  and a very cool and wet summer in the northeast and mid west 
in connection with the lost customer  such customer was reacquired in the beginning of with respect to engine management  net sales in were million  an increase of million or when compared to the increase reflects the successful acquisition of a major new customer in the third quarter of contributed approximately million of net sales for the year ended december  
as discussed in more detail in our comparison of to  significant warranty and overstock returns in our temperature control segment adversely impacted financial performance in with respect to warranty returns  after thorough analysis of related warranty claims  the company has taken specific actions to reduce compressor warranty returns in and beyond 
the company has instituted new counterperson and installer training programs  increased emphasis on clinics and professional seminars for installers  and tightened rules for authorized warranty returns this the company believes to be the major improvement  which was previously not required 
beginning in  it is now a requirement that each and every compressor returned for warranty credit must have either a service repair work order or a purchase receipt providing proof that a number of additional auxiliary parts were replaced concurrently ie accumulator  orifice tube  in line filter  condenser and that an air conditioning system flushing with an approved solvent was performed 
not performing a twelve step process  that we have defined  will void the warranty 
with respect to overstock returns  was adversely impacted by the company s decision to accept customer returns in connection with the company s decision to discontinue the offering of certain temperature control products discussed in more detail in our to comparison 
the year was absent of any such significant decision 
in addition  during  the company placed further restrictions on the amounts that customers can return as overstock returns 
gross margins  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in temperature control gross margins were positively impacted by reduced customer returns and an increase in net pricing 
engine management margins were positively impacted by increased sales volume  increases in net pricing and certain cost reductions activities discussed below 
in connection with cost reduction activities  the year was benefited by the consolidation of three distribution centers into one in our temperature control segment  merging our existing fan clutch operations in our temperature control segment  and moving two us manufacturing plants to a single facility in mexico in the engine management segment 
the aforementioned initiatives improved operating income of temperature control and engine management segments by approximately million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased approximately million in  primarily a result of the cost reduction efforts described in the previous paragraph and an million decrease in bad debt expense as compared to operating income increased by million  or in results of the engine management division  as compared to a year ago  reflected an increase in operating income of million due to higher sales  favorable overhead absorption and cost reduction activities 
operating income at the temperature control division decreased by million  primarily due to the net sales decrease reasons cited above 
the company has strengthened its controls and procedures for accepting authorized customer warranty returns in  and has completed the consolidation of its manufacturing and distribution facilities 
these changes have had a favorable impact on results and are expected to provide future benefits 
other income  net  was approximately 
million  comparing favorable to other expense  net of million in this is primarily the result of our decision to exit the heat battery joint venture in canada  further discussed in our comparison of to interest expense increased by approximately million to million in  primarily do to higher average borrowings resulting from elevated inventory levels and decreased sales 
income tax expense decreased from million in to million in the effective tax rate also decreased from in to in due to a increase in earnings from the company s puerto and hong kong subsidiaries  which have lower tax rates than the united states statutory rate 
on march   the company prepaid the entire outstanding balance of the senior note payable in the amount of  in connection with this prepayment  the company incurred an extraordinary loss of  net of taxes  for prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred loan costs 
comparison of to net sales in were million  an increase of million or from the comparable period in the company s results include twelve months of sales of the temperature control business acquired from cooper industries moog automotive  while results reflect nine months 
excluding revenues from acquisitions not present in  sales decreased by million or  as compared to net sales in our temperature control division increased by million  however  after giving consideration to acquisitions not present in  net sales decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease is primarily a function of a higher level of warranty and overstock returns  non recurring costs of approximately million before income taxes associated with the consolidating and balancing of four seasons and cooper inventories in the field discussed below  and the negative impact of mild weather conditions on automotive air conditioning and heating product gross sales 
with respect to our engine management division  net sales decreased by million as compared to net sales declines in the engine management division reflect the continued weakness in the automotive aftermarket and reduced orders from a major customer  as this customer absorbed inventory acquired from aps holding corporation  a former customer currently in bankruptcy proceedings 
with respect to the company and specifically our temperature control segment  the product that contributes most significantly to defective returns is the air conditioning compressor 
the air conditioning compressor  not unlike electronic components  is subject to failure when an incomplete or inadequate repair job is done by the person servicing the automobile 
a large percentage of warranty returns historically have been received by the company in the fourth quarter of any given year 
this is because of the seasonal nature of the company s temperature control business 
the fourth quarter of was unusually high in dollars and was above the company s estimates 
the company believes that the major cause of the increase in warranty returns was two fold an increasing level of improper installations 
in many cases  after subsequent examination  it was found that an incomplete repair job on the vehicles was performed either by neglecting to flush the air conditioning system of contaminants  failure to notice defects elsewhere in the system or failure to replace auxiliary parts  and a mild summer resulting in customers returning compressors as allegedly defective that otherwise may not have been returned 
with respect to overstock returns  approximately million relates to the company s decision to discontinue the offering of certain temperature control products  previously sold by moog automotive under the brand names of murray and everco estimated to be of total and certain other products sold by the company under the four seasons brand name estimated to be of remaining total 
with the acquisition of moog automotive in  the company s brand offerings increased and in turn so did catalogue and inventory challenges 
traditionally  in these types of situations  the company has two choices  expand the product offering in the brands absent such products or to discontinue the product offerings  the company decided the latter 
in connection with decisions  such as these  products on the customer s shelves are negatively impacted 
the investment in these products need to be absorbed by either the company s customers or by the company allowing the customers to return such product as an overstock return 
the company decided the latter 
gross margins  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in on an overall basis  this decline reflects a higher mix of temperature control products with lower average gross margins than engine management products 
temperature control gross margins were negatively impacted by the customer returns and non recurring costs discussed above and by discounts related to a pre season selling program which was not present in engine management margins were negatively impacted by reduced sales volume and the related unfavorable changes in overhead absorption at certain facilities 
as a result  gross profit on a consolidated basis decreased in by million as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased approximately million in  primarily a result of sg a expenses related to entities acquired in  not present in and million related to severance payments primarily associated with personnel reductions in the corporate headquarters function 
such reductions are part of the company s cost reduction initiatives 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a decreased from to 
this decrease reflects the company s continued focus on cost reduction programs implemented in  the integration of cooper industries temperature control business into the existing four seasons infrastructure and lower compensation costs related to the company s eva incentive compensation program and retirement profit sharing program 
operating income decreased by million  or in  primarily due to the decline in gross profit discussed above 
results of the engine management division  as compared to a year ago  reflected a reduction in operating income of million due to lower sales and the negative impact on overhead absorption 
the underabsorption of overhead experienced at certain facilities has also been impacted by the divestiture of the service line business  which shared these facilities 
plans are being considered to reduce these costs in operating income at the temperature control division decreased by million  or  primarily for the reasons cited above 
the company has strengthened its controls and procedures for accepting authorized customer warranty returns in  and has completed the consolidation of its manufacturing and distribution facilities 
these changes are expected to have a favorable impact on results and beyond 
other expense  net  decreased from million in to million in  as gains from selling certain administrative and distribution facilities offset costs incurred in connection with the company s decision to exit its heat battery joint venture in canada  centaur thermal systems  inc centaur 
through a joint venture relationship with a ats automation tooling systems  inc a canadian corporation the company set out a goal to commercialize sales to the original equipment market  a market to which the company had only limited success in supplying products on an aftermarket basis dealer accessory only 
centaur s main business operation was manufacturing and selling heat batteries for automobiles 
although centaur had reached some limited commercial success  as an aftermarket accessory  dating back to  sales were limited with no large successes going into the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  it was mutually agreed to between the joint venture participants  that due to lack of significant commercial success and recurring losses  the joint venture would close 
in connection with this decision  we recorded an approximate million charge relating to writing down the company s investment to net realizable value 
beyond our investment  only insignificant costs were expended 
this action is part of the company s cost reduction efforts 
interest expense decreased by approximately million to million in  primarily due to more favorable borrowing rates 
income tax expense decreased from million in to million in however  the effective tax rate increased from in to in due to a decrease in earnings from the company s puerto rico and hong kong subsidiaries  which have lower tax rates than the united states statutory rate 
on july  the company prepaid the entire outstanding balance of the senior note payable in the amount of  in connection with this prepayment  the company incurred an extraordinary loss of  net of taxes  for prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred loan costs 
impact of inflation although inflation is not a significant issue  the company s management believes it will be able to continue to minimize any adverse effect of inflation on earnings 
this will be achieved principally by cost reduction programs and  where competitive situations permit  selling price increases 
future results of operations the company continues to face competitive pressures 
in order to sell at competitive prices while maintaining profit margins  the company is continuing to focus on overhead and cost reductions 
however  the company s main focus currently is to reduce inventory levels requiring reductions in production and purchasing levels 
gross margins have been  and will continue to be negatively impacted resulting from underabsorbed overhead 
at december  the company did not comply with certain covenant requirements for which the company received waivers and amendments on march  with the revolving credit facility set to expire on november   the company is currently negotiating with potential lenders to provide for a multi year revolving credit facility 
the company is expecting to complete the placement of such a facility by april  depending on the specific financing agreement  the company may be required to repay and extinguish certain long term debt obligations  as well as incur prepayment penalties 
in addition  should a new financing agreement not be entered into prior to april   the company is obligated to provide security interests in inventory and accounts receivable to the lending institutions party to the current revolving credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  the company is exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of its financing 
the company does not use any significant derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign currency options  interest rate swaps and interest rate agreements  to manage these risks  nor does it hold or issue derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
exchange rate risk the company has exchange rate exposure  primarily  with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the company s financial instruments which are subject to this exposure amount to approximately million  which includes million of indebtedness  million in accounts payable and million of accounts receivable 
the potential immediate loss to the company that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the earnings or cash flows of the company 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on the company s foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk at december  the company had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
the company invests its excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
due to the fact that the majority of the company s debt is at fixed rates with various maturities and due to the short term nature of cash investments  the potential loss to the company over one year  that would have resulted from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rates applicable to financial assets and liabilities on december  would not be expected to have a material impact on the earnings or cash flows of the company 
however  due to seasonality with respect to the company s short term financing  which is at variable rates  the market risk may be higher at various points throughout the year 
the company s existing three year credit facility provides a million unsecured line of credit  subject to a borrowing base as defined and consists of two variable based interest options 
depending upon the level of borrowings  under this credit facility  which may at times approach million  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have a material impact on the earnings or cash flows of the company
