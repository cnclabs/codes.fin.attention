item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
asset liability management the company s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is affected by net interest spread 
changes in net interest spread interest rate risk are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  customer options  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk policies designed to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
the board of directors approves acceptable interest rate risk levels designed to provide sufficient net interest income and market value of shareholder equity npv assuming specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
one measure of the company s exposure to interest rate risk is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of its major assets and liabilities as of march  repricing frequencies of assets are based upon contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  and the scheduled principal payments and estimated prepayments 
repricing of liabilities are based upon the contractual maturities  estimated decay rates for core deposits  and the earliest repricing opportunity for variable and floating rate instruments 
the company also had million of putable fhlb advances on the balance sheet as of march  that are assumed to reprice at their next put date 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if actual experience differed from that assumed 
march  months or less more than months to months more than months to months more than months to years more than years to years more than years total fair value dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash  investment securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and fhlb stock loans and mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities loans receivable  net total loans and mortgage backed securities total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities fixed maturity deposits core deposits total deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities based upon contractual maturities  repricing date and forecasted principal payments assuming normal amortization and  where applicable prepayments 
assumes annual decay rates ranging from 
putable borrowings are presented based upon their first put date 
the company s one year gap at march   was negative ie  more interest bearing liabilities reprice within one year than interest earning assets  this compares with positive at march  the change in the company s one year repricing gap between march  and is attributable  in part  to a change in the presentation of core deposits from decay rates with lives of more than five years to recognition that all core deposits are subjected to repricing within one year 
although the table indicates the company is more exposed to declining interest rates in the short term  a gap table is limited to measuring the timing risk and does not reflect the impact of customer options or basis risk 
to better measure the company s exposure to these and other components of interest rate risk  management relies on an internally maintained  externally supported asset liability simulation model 
the company forecasts its net interest income for the next twelve months  and its npv  assuming there are no changes in interest rates or the balance sheet structure from the current period end 
once this base case has been established  the company subjects its balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes of and basis points to the treasury yield curve 
prepayment speeds and the responsiveness of the various indices are estimated for each rate change level 
the model then re forecasts net interest income and npv 
the tables below indicate the results of the company s internal modeling of its balance sheet as of march  and once again  it should be noted that the internal calculation of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if the company s response to changes in interest rates included changes in the structure of its balance sheet 
march  percentage change change in interest rates in basis points net interest income net portfolio value this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income for the period from april  through march  assuming the company does not change the structure of its balance sheet 
this percentage represents the npv of the company assuming no changes to the balance sheet 
the results from the asset liability simulation model indicate that the company s net interest income would benefit  or increase  during periods of rising rates  and decline during periods of declining rates 
this is a direct result of the success of the company s strategic concentration on the four cs and core deposits 
the four cs generally have shorter durations  quicker response to rate changes  and are associated with more responsive indices than traditional single family loans 
additionally  core deposits have relatively low sensitivity to movements in market rates compared to cds 
march  percentage change change in interest rates in basis points net interest income net portfolio value this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income for the period from april  through march  assuming the company does not change the structure of its balance sheet 
this percentage represents the npv of the company assuming no changes to the balance sheet 
although the gap table indicates the company s net interest income should perform better in a rising rate environment  results from the asset liability simulation model indicate that yield compression would occur decreasing net interest income over the next twelve months 
these results reflect the impact rising rates would have in decreasing prepayments  assets encountering periodic and lifetime caps and other factors that are not included in the gap table 
the ots produces an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports 
the results of the ots model may vary from the bank s internal model primarily due to differences between assumptions utilized in the bank s internal model and the ots model  including estimated loan market rates  prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates 
as of march   the bank s sensitivity measure  as calculated by the ots  was a negative 
this represents a decrease in sensitivity of basis points from the march  results 
average balance sheets the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended march   and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are derived from average daily balances 
the yields include fees that are considered adjustments to yields

interest income interest income increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was attributable principally to a basis point increase in yield on average interest earning assets from for fiscal to for fiscal average interest earning assets increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the average yield on loans receivable  net increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in average yield on loans receivable  net reflects the bank s continuing emphasis on the four cs as well as the impact of a generally higher interest rate environment during fiscal the proportion of the loan portfolio comprised by the disbursed balance of the four cs increased million during fiscal to million or percent of loans receivable  net at march  from million or percent of loans receivable  net at march  originations of the four cs totaled million or percent of total originations for fiscal compared to million or percent of total originations for fiscal the average yield on the aggregate average balance of securities  increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in average yield on securities was attributable primarily to the increase in the general level of interest rates 
the one year cmt index to which of the company s securities portfolio is tied averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal one month libor  to which of the company s securities portfolio is tied averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal premium amortization net of discount accretion on securities of  for fiscal and million for fiscal decreased the yield on securities by basis points and basis points for fiscal and  respectively 
the weighted average cost basis of the securities held by the company at march  was percent of par value 
the increase in average interest earnings assets between fiscal and fiscal was comprised principally of a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable  net from billion to billion partially offset by a million decrease in the aggregate average balance of investment securities from million to million 
during fiscal  the company continued the strategy it began during fiscal of reducing its wholesale leverage securities funded with fhlb advances and other borrowings 
this strategy was undertaken in connection with the company s focus on enhancing its net interest spread and achieving an earnings stream and balance sheet comprised to a greater extent by the four cs on the asset side and core deposits on the liability side 
strong loan origination volumes of the four cs have provided an investment alternative for the company which is preferential to securities  and is consistent with its long term strategic objectives 
interest expense interest expense increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of deposits increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of cds increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal and the average cost of core deposits increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of fhlb advances and other borrowings was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increases in funding costs for deposits and fhlb advances and other borrowings reflect the increase in the general level of interest rates between fiscal and fiscal average interest bearing liabilities increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities was comprised of a million increase in the average balance of total deposits from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings from million for fiscal to million for fiscal provision for loan losses provision for loan losses was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in the provision for loan losses between fiscal and fiscal reflects the increase in the company s level of non accrual loans 
the bank s emphasis on the four cs has also resulted in a change in the overall risk profile of the bank s loan portfolio 
non accrual loans were million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  the allowance for loan losses was million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  non interest income non interest income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal core non interest income total non interest income excluding trading securities portfolio activity  fiscal gain on branch sale and fiscal marketable equity security impairment writedown increased  or between fiscal and fiscal to million 
deposit and related fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the  decrease in deposit and related fees was attributable to a  decrease in commissions earned from sales of non deposit investment ndi products to million for fiscal from million for fiscal ndi products consist primarily of third party annuities and mutual funds 
trust fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal trust fees for fiscal reflect a  non recurring downward adjustment of fees 
gain loss on sales of assets was  for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the million loss for fiscal includes a  writedown of a marketable equity security deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
loan and servicing fees of million for fiscal were comparable with fiscal higher volumes of loan payoffs during fiscal increased loan fee income in an amount comparable to the  prepayment fee received on a commercial loan during fiscal the net loss from trading activity was million for fiscal compared to a net gain of million for fiscal reflecting the dramatic change in the direction of the equity markets between the two periods 
non interest expense non interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased million or from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal compensation and benefits expense increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal included in compensation and benefits expense for fiscal and fiscal  respectively are non cash charges of million and million associated with the bank s esop and incentive plan 
the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was attributable  in part  to fiscal expenditures of  associated with increased marketing efforts directed toward the hispanic segments of the communities served by the bank 
hispanic marketing expenditures for fiscal are expected to equal or exceed the fiscal level 
the  decrease in other non interest expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was due primarily to office supplies expense 
income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal comparison of financial condition at march  and march  total assets decreased million or from billion at march  to billion at march  loans receivable  net decreased million from billion at march  to billion at march  loan originations were billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal the decrease in originations between fiscal and reflects the bank s de emphasis on family residential mortgage lending 
the weighted average initial contract rate for total loan originations was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal investment securities as defined earlier decreased million from million at march  to million at march the million increase in cash and cash equivalents from million at march  to million at march  reflects the acceleration in cash inflows during the fourth quarter of fiscal arising from increased levels of loan and investment security pre payments 
total liabilities decreased million or from billion march  to billion at march  total deposits increased million from billion at march  to billion at march  core deposits increased million during fiscal to million or percent of total deposits at march  fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased million from million at march  to million at march  the decrease in fhlb advances and other borrowings was facilitated by the strong deposit activity as well as the bank s strategy of de emphasizing wholesale leverage 
in response to the acceleration in cash inflows from loans and securities  the bank pre paid million of fhlb advances and other borrowings during the fourth quarter of fiscal total stockholders equity increased million from million at march  to million at march  the million increase is comprised principally of a million increase in retained earnings  substantially restricted  a million decrease in unearned stock based compensation and a million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss on securities available for sale 
the million increase in retained earnings  substantially restricted was attributable to the company s net earnings of million for fiscal partially offset by million attributable to the amount paid by the company to repurchase  shares of its common stock in excess of the original issuance price of the stock and million of cash dividends declared during fiscal the million decrease in unearned stock based compensation was attributable to the amortization of shares under the company s esop million and incentive plan million 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march general the company reported net earnings of million for fiscal compared to net earnings of million for fiscal the improvement in operating results between fiscal and fiscal was attributable principally to an increase in net interest income from million for fiscal to million for fiscal attributable to expansion of net interest rate spread coupled with growth in average interest earning assets and an increase in non interest income from million for fiscal to million for fiscal driven principally by a million gain on branch sale during fiscal interest income interest income increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was attributable to a million increase in average interest earning assets from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal and a basis point increase in yield on average interest earning assets from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in average interest earning assets between fiscal and fiscal was comprised principally of a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable  net from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in the aggregate average balance of securities from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the average yield on loans receivable  net increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal reflecting the bank s increased emphasis on the origination of the four cs 
the disbursed balance of the four cs increased million during fiscal to million or of loans receivable  net at march  from million or of loans receivable  net at march  the level of prepayments of higher yielding residential mortgage loans declined between fiscal and fiscal this decline resulted in a decrease in premium amortization on purchased loans 
this premium amortization  net of discount accretion  amounted to  or a basis point reduction in yield on loans receivable  net for fiscal compared to million or a basis point reduction in yield for fiscal at march   the bank s weighted average carrying value of loans purchased from others as a percentage of outstanding principal balance was the average yield on the aggregate average balance of securities was for fiscal compared to for fiscal consistent with the company s strategy of reducing wholesale leverage  maturing securities were not replaced 
premium amortization net of discount accretion on securities of million for fiscal and million for fiscal decreased the yield on investment securities by basis points and basis points for fiscal and  respectively 
the one year cmt index to which of the company s march  securities portfolio is tied  averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal one month libor  to which of the company s march  securities portfolio is tied  averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal the weighted average cost basis of the securities held by the company at march  was percent of par value 
interest expense interest expense decreased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities from for fiscal to for fiscal  partially offset by an million increase in average interest bearing liabilities from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities was comprised of a million increase in the average balance of deposits from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the million increase in the average balance of deposits during fiscal is net of million of deposits sold during the fiscal year 
the average cost of deposits decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal contributing to the decrease in the average cost of deposits was a million increase in the average balance of core deposits from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the average cost of fhlb advances and other borrowings was for fiscal compared to for fiscal provision for loan losses provision for loan losses was million for both fiscal and the consistency in provision for loan losses between fiscal and reflects the relationship between two factors 
the bank is experiencing improvement in its overall level of asset quality and has assessed an improvement in general economic conditions and property valuations in its market area 
at the same time  the bank s emphasis on the four cs is changing the overall risk profile of the bank s loan portfolio 
non performing loans were million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  the allowance for loan losses was million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  non interest income non interest income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase was attributable principally to a million gain on branch sale during fiscal deposit and related fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal trust fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal gain loss on sales of assets was million for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the million loss for fiscal includes a  writedown of a marketable equity security deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the increase in loan and servicing fees from million for fiscal to million for fiscal is attributable  in part  to a  prepayment fee received on a commercial loan during fiscal the net gain from trading activity was million for fiscal compared to  for fiscal non interest expense non interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased  or from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal compensation and benefits expense increased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal included in compensation and benefits expense are non cash charges of million and million associated with the bank s esop and incentive plan 
occupancy and equipment expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the  decrease in occupancy and equipment expense between fiscal and fiscal was attributable principally to a reduction in expenditures and reduced depreciation 
the  decrease in other non interest expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was due primarily to a  reduction in office supplies and expense resulting from renegotiation and consolidation of telecommunications services 
income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and securities  fhlb advances and other borrowings  proceeds from the maturation of securities and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of loans 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage and security prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
effective march  the ots adopted an interim rule eliminating the statutory liquidity requirement 
in its place  the ots adopted a policy  consistent with that of the other federal banking regulatory agencies  that liquidity be maintained at a level which provides for safe and sound banking practices and financial flexibility 
the bank s average liquidity ratios were  and for the years ended march   and  respectively 
this reflects management s strategy to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest earning assets  such as loans or other investments  depending on market conditions 
the bank has invested in corporate securities when the yields thereon have been more attractive than us government and federal agency securities of similar maturity 
while corporate securities are not backed by any government agency  the maturity structure and credit quality of all corporate securities owned by the bank meet the minimum standards set forth by the ots for regulatory liquidity qualifying investments 
the bank invests in callable debt issued by federal agencies of the us government when the yields thereon to call date s and maturity exceed the yields on comparable term and credit quality non callable investments by amounts which management deems sufficient to compensate the bank for the call options inherent in the securities 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and purchases of mortgage backed and other investment securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturation of investments and paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
principal payments on loans were billion  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
disbursements on loans originated and purchased  excluding loans originated for sale  were billion  billion and billion for the years ended march   and  respectively 
disbursements for purchases of mortgage backed and other investment securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
proceeds from the maturation of investment securities and paydowns of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were million  million and million for the years ended march   and respectively 
net cash provided by used in financing activities consisted primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and fhlb advances and other borrowings 
the net increases in deposits were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the net increases decreases in fhlb advances and other borrowings were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
at march   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
see item description of business regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the utilization of reverse repurchase agreements and fhlb advances 
at march   the bank had million of fhlb advances outstanding 
based upon pledged collateral in place  the company had available borrowing capacity of million as of march  no collateral was pledged under reverse repurchase agreements at march  other sources of liquidity include securities maturing within one year 
the company currently has no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures 
see item description of business general 
at march  the bank had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans of million and zero  respectively  compared to million and zero  respectively  at march  at march  and the company had no outstanding commitments to purchase mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and other investment securities 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet these commitments 
see item description of business general 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled billion 
the bank expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificate accounts will be retained by the bank at maturity 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts or market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
segment reporting the company  through the branch network of the bank  provides a broad range of financial services to individuals and companies located primarily in southern california 
these services include demand  time  and savings deposits  real estate  business and consumer lending  atm processing  cash management  and trust services 
while the company s chief decision makers monitor the revenue streams of the various company products and services  operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company wide basis
