many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed

you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our filings with the us securities and exchange commission 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of overview genaera corporation  formerly known as magainin pharmaceuticals inc  is a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines for serious diseases from genomics and natural products 
our research and development efforts are focused on anti angiogenesis  obesity  infectious diseases and respiratory diseases 
we changed our name from magainin pharmaceuticals inc to genaera corporation on march  since commencing operations in  we have not generated any revenue from product sales  and we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities 
we have incurred a loss in each year since our inception  and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that losses may fluctuate  and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately  we will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations 
results of operations revenues we have received no revenues from product sales 
revenues recorded to date have consisted principally of revenues recognized under collaborations with corporate partners 
we recorded revenue of  in reflecting the receipt of payments under the glaxosmithkline agreement entered into in february for locilex tm cream 
we had hoped to commercialize locilex tm cream in the near term 
however  with the fda s decision not to approve locilex tm cream  near term commercialization will not occur  and we will generate no revenues from locilex tm cream in the near future 
glaxosmithkline remains our exclusive sales  marketing and distribution partner for the north american territory for locilex tm cream 
we have no currently existing collaborations that will result in the realization of research and development revenues 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased in the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year ago  due to increases in squalamine development  clinical and manufacturing activity as well as preclinical and development activity in our mucoregulator  il antibody and produlestan programs 
research and development expenses decreased in the year ended december  as compared to those in the year ended december   due to reductions in manufacturing development  clinical and regulatory costs  and personnel expenses  principally due to decreased development activity relating to locilex tm cream 
the level of research and development expenses in future periods will depend principally upon the progress of our research and development programs and our capital resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs and professional fees and have decreased in as compared to the prior year due principally to the decrease in those costs 
general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  decreased compared to those in the year ended december   due to a reduction in personnel expenses 
other income and expense interest income increased during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  due to higher investment balances 
interest income decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  due to lower investment balances 
the increase in interest expense for the years ended december  and  as compared to the prior years  is due principally to the recognition of interest expense associated with the long term obligation to abbott laboratories 
net loss our goal is to conduct significant research  pre clinical development  clinical testing and manufacturing activities over the next several years 
we expect that these activities  together with projected general and administrative expenses  will result in continued and significant losses 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources cash and investments were  at december  as compared to  at december  the primary use of cash was to finance our operations 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities  including 
 raised from our initial public offering in december  
 raised from a public offering completed in february  
 raised from a private placement completed in october  
 raised from a public offering completed in august  
 raised from a private placement completed in august  
 raised from a public offering completed in december  
 raised from a private placement completed in december  
 raised from a public offering completed in october  
 raised from a private placement completed in may  
 raised from a private placement completed in august  and 
 raised from a private placement in december in addition to the above  we have funded our operations from contract and grant revenues  interest income and lease and debt financing 
current liabilities increased by  to  at december   due principally to increased research contract accruals related to squalamine development as well as the transfer of  owed to abbott to current liabilities as a result of our financing activities 
we had an agreement with abbott providing for the purchase of approximately  of bulk drug substance for locilex tm cream 
as fda approval of locilex tm cream did not occur  we renegotiated this agreement with abbott in  paying abbott  and receiving partial delivery of material 
an additional  is due to abbott and payable if we receive in excess of  of additional funds in any year beginning in  in which case of such excess over  shall be payable to abbott 
we have no further purchase commitments to abbott  and abbott has no further supply requirements to us 
long term accrued development expense decreased by  to  at december  due to the transfer of a portion of the amount owed abbott to current liabilities 
under the terms of our  note payable  we make monthly interest only payments at an annual rate of  with principal due in june we maintain cash and investments of  as collateral for the note payable 
in may  we entered into a research  development and commercialization collaboration agreement with genentech  inc under this agreement  we would have co developed with genentech an antibody to il for asthma  with options for other products in respiratory disease 
we simultaneously executed a stock purchase agreement with genentech pursuant to which we received from genentech approximately  in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our common stock and  representing the issuance of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  redeemable under certain circumstances 
we would have conducted development activities through phase ii clinical testing for pharmaceutical products covered by the collaboration agreement and genentech would have conducted phase iii clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing for such products 
we may have elected to co fund genentech s phase iii clinical and regulatory costs in return for a share of profits and losses resulting from the sales of covered product in the us we would have received a royalty on sales overseas and in the us if we elected not to fund the phase iii and regulatory costs 
future development funding would have been provided to us by genentech through the issuance of additional shares of the series a preferred stock to genentech 
cumulative preferred dividends under the series a preferred stock are payable in arrears on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of the prime rate plus 
in august  we sold approximately  shares of our common stock  through a private placement  at a price of per share 
net proceeds to genaera from the offering were approximately  after offering costs 
in november  we issued of our series a preferred stock to genentech for  which represented further il antibody development funding 
in december  genentech elected to terminate the collaboration agreement covering the il antibody development program and related respiratory technology 
as a result  all licensed technology under this agreement  exclusive of genentech improved technology  will be returned to us 
we expect to repartner this antibody development program during we will need to raise substantial additional funds in the future to continue our research and development programs and to commercialize our potential products 
if we are unable to raise such funds  we may be unable to complete our development activities for any of our proposed products 
we regularly explore alternative means of financing our operations and seek funding through various sources  including public and private securities offerings and collaborative arrangements with third parties 
we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds  and may be unable to obtain sufficient funding in the future on acceptable terms 
if we cannot obtain funding  we will need to delay  scale back or eliminate research and development programs or enter into collaborations with third parties to commercialize potential products or technologies that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or seek other arrangements 
if we engage in collaborations  we will receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
our capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  the demand for products based on our technology  if and when such products are approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
we had no significant capital commitments as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in only us government debt instruments that meet high quality credit standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure we may have to any one issue  issuer or type of investment 
as of december   our portfolio investments consisted of million in cash and million in u 
s government debt instruments having a maturity of less than one year 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio  management believes that a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average annualized yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
