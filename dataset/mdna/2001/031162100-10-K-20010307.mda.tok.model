financial outlook in december and early  the company filed regulatory submissions for the use of aranesp tm in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and chronic renal failure in the us  the european union  canada  australia and new zealand

the company expects the percentage increase of sales of epogen r and aranesp tm combined over epogen r sales to be in the range of high teens to low twenties 
patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government

in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of neupogen r are dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as governments for example  medicare and medicaid programs in the us and private insurance plans 
therefore  neupogen r sales may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the bases for reimbursement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income earned on the company s investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the company s short term borrowings effectively bear interest at variable rates and therefore  changes in us interest rates affect interest expense incurred thereon 
the company had reduced this exposure to interest rate changes by entering into an interest rate swap agreement  which expired during  that effectively changed the interest expense incurred on a portion of its short term borrowings to a fixed rate 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s long term borrowings because they all bear interest at fixed rates 
the following tables provide information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the company s investment portfolio and debt obligations  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the company has assumed its available for sale debt securities  comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities  are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
for the interest rate swap  the tables present the notional amount and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity date 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract
