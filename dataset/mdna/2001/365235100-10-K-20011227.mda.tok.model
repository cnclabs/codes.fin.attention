occupancy and other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes and insurance 
certain elements of the company s restaurant operating expenses and  in particular  occupancy costs  are relatively fixed 
however  a significant majority of the company s leases provide for periodic escalation of minimum annual rentals based upon increases in the consumer price index 
occupancy costs  as well as depreciation and amortization expenses  will vary between restaurants depending on whether a restaurant site is leased or owned

a restaurant is included in this computation after it has been open for full calendar months 
as a result  a restaurant may be included in this computation for only a portion of a given quarter or year 
the company s restaurants experience seasonal influences  as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is generally realized during the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings  and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its cash requirements principally from cash flow from operating activities  bank debt  mortgage financing  sale leaseback of owned properties and sale of company stock 
the company does not have significant receivables and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms when purchasing food and supplies 
for the fiscal year ended september   the company generated million from operating activities  repaid million under its bank line of credit  obtained million from equipment and mortgage financing with repayments of million and received million from the sale of the company s common stock pursuant to stock option plans and the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the company s principal capital requirement has been for funding the development of restaurants 
historically  the company has primarily leased the land and buildings for its restaurant operations 
the company does purchase land or land and buildings when favorable conditions are available 
the company currently owns the land or land and buildings for restaurants  including the land for certain sites the company expects to open during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal the company opened three owned salad buffet restaurant sites  six leased salad buffet restaurant sites  one leased slurp location  and one leased kitchen facility  reopened one leased restaurant site and completed sale leasebacks for five restaurant sites 
as of september   the company operated salad buffet restaurants  ladles restaurant  and slurp restaurant 
the company s principal capital requirement has been and will continue to be funding the development of restaurants 
for the year ended september   cash used in investing activities totaled million including million in proceeds from the sale lease back of five restaurant locations which partially offset the million of expenditures for the development of new restaurants 
the remaining capital expenditures primarily funded replacements and new additions at existing restaurants 
in addition to budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal of million for new restaurant openings  the company has budgeted million in expenditures for fiscal for capital improvements at existing sites 
see business unit economics 
as of september   the company had borrowed million of its million bank line of credit 
such credit line bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate  which totaled per annum as of september   or libor plus 
as of september   none of the million credit line was borrowed at libor 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by equipment and other assets 
the credit agreement will expire on december  and contains various financial covenants and restrictions  including restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends or to effect mergers or acquisitions without the bank s approval 
as of september   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenant provisions of the credit agreement 
however the financial institution has waived the violations through september  and has negotiated a new credit agreement with the company consisting of two term loans in the amount of million due december   and million  due march   respectively 
the new term loans require scheduled repayments of principal and interest at regular intervals throughout the terms of the agreement and bear interest at a rate equal to either the prime rate or libor plus  and prime rate or libor plus  respectively 
the new term loans are collaterized by equipment and other assets of the company 
this new agreement contains various financial covenants and restrictions 
in connection with the development of new restaurants  the company has over time obtained mortgage and equipment financing from approximately nine lenders  each of which has financed multiple loans 
the outstanding balance of each loan generally is between million and million 
the loans have varying maturity rates extending through august  interest rates generally ranging from through with an average interest rate of per annum  and in certain cases  pre payment penalties of one to two percent 
as of september   the outstanding balances on such loans aggregated approximately million 
in addition to funds generated from operations  sale leaseback of owned properties and the sale of the company s stock  the company will need to obtain external financing to complete its expansion plans for fiscal year and beyond 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed 
additionally  should the company s results of operations decrease or should costs or capital expenditures rise  the company may not have the ability to open new restaurants at its desired pace or at all  because capital may not be available 
see business risks expansion risks 
if these sources of financing are insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
there is no assurance that financing will be available to the company on favorable terms  or at all 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past four years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to guests 
effects of energy crisis the company continues to experience increased energy costs related to the california energy crisis and to higher natural gas prices in its other markets 
in addition to higher utility costs  the california energy crisis has resulted in electricity shortages that have caused power providers to implement rolling blackouts throughout the state 
disruptions in the power supply could occur in areas where company restaurants are located  causing those restaurants to experience temporary interruptions in operations 
such interruptions in operations may result in lost revenue and affect store profitability 
the increased utility and natural gas costs were not part of the company s original plan and will continue to affect the company s profitability 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the interruptions in power supplies resulting from the energy shortages in california will not also impact the company s operating results and ability to control costs in the future

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to tangible long lived assets that have a legal obligation associated with their retirement that results from the acquisition  construction or development or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied during the quarter ending december  to accomplish this  the company must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
the determination of fair value is complex and will require the company to gather market information and develop cash flow models 
additionally  the company will be required to develop processes to track and monitor these obligations

business risks in addition to other information in this form k  shareholders and prospective investors should consider carefully the following factors in evaluating the company and its business 
certain operating results and considerations in fiscal  and  the company experienced an increase of   and respectively  in comparable restaurant sales 
the company does not believe it has significant latitude to achieve comparable restaurant sales growth through price increases  and  as a result  the company does not believe that recent comparable restaurant sales are indicative of future trends in comparable restaurant sales 
the company believes that it may from time to time in the future experience declines in comparable restaurant sales  and that any future increases in comparable restaurant sales may be modest 
further  the company s newer restaurants have not historically experienced significant increases in guest volume following their initial opening period 
see selected financial data 
expansion risks the company opened ten salad buffet restaurants in fiscal  seventeen in fiscal  and ten in fiscal opening nine new restaurants and re opening one existing restaurant 
the company currently intends to open four restaurants in fiscal the company may experience difficulty in opening four restaurants in fiscal  including but not limited to hiring qualified restaurant managers and staff 
the company s ability to achieve its expansion plans will depend on a variety of factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control  including the company s ability to locate suitable restaurant sites  qualified managers  negotiate acceptable leases or purchase terms  obtain required governmental approvals  construct new restaurants in a timely manner  attract  train and retain qualified and experienced personnel and management  operate its restaurants profitably and obtain additional capital  as well as general economic conditions and the degree of competition in the particular region of expansion 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  delays in restaurant openings from time to time 
since its inception  the company has closed three non performing restaurants and currently plans on closing the remaining ladles restaurant and the slurp restaurant during the first half of fiscal due to poor operating performance 
given the number of restaurants in current operation and the company s projected expansion rate  there can be no assurances that the company will not close restaurants in the future 
any closure could result in a significant write off of assets  which could adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company incurs substantial costs in opening a new restaurant and  in the company s experience  new restaurants experience fluctuating operational levels for some time after opening 
owned restaurants generally require significantly more up front capital than leased restaurants 
as a result  an increase in the percentage of owned restaurant openings as compared to historical practice would increase the capital required to meet the company s growth plans 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully expand into new regions or that the company s existing or new restaurants will be profitable 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
see restaurant industry and competition  business expansion strategy and business competition 
restaurant industry and competition the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality and value of the food products offered  quality of service  price  dining experience  restaurant location and the ambiance of the facilities 
the company s primary competitors include mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  as well as traditional self service buffet and other soup and salad restaurants and healthful and nutrition oriented restaurants 
the company competes with national and regional chains  as well as individually owned restaurants 
the number of buffet and casual restaurants with operations generally similar to the company s has grown substantially in the last several years and the company believes competition among buffet style and casual restaurants has increased and will continue to increase as the company s competitors expand operations in various geographic areas 
such increased competition could increase the company s operating costs or adversely affect its revenues 
the company believes it competes favorably in the industry  although many of the company s competitors which have been in existence longer than the company  have a more established market presence and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company  which may give them certain competitive advantages 
in addition  the restaurant industry has few non economic barriers to entry 
therefore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not be able to successfully imitate and implement the company s concept 
the company has encountered intense competition for restaurant sites  and in many cases has had difficulty buying or leasing desirable sites on terms that are acceptable to the company 
in many cases  the company s competitors are willing and able to pay more than the company for sites 
the company expects these difficulties in obtaining desirable sites to continue for the foreseeable future 
cost sensitivity the company s profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor  utilities and other operating costs 
the company s dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects it to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could materially adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and minimum unemployment tax rates  rent increases resulting from the rent escalation provisions in the company s leases  and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the company 
the company believes recent relatively favorable inflation rates and part time labor supplies in its principal market area have contributed to relatively stable food and labor costs in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue or that the company will have the ability to control costs in the future 
see reliance on key suppliers and distributors  and business 
importance of key employees the company is heavily dependent upon the services of its officers and key management personnel involved in restaurant operations  purchasing  expansion and administration 
in particular  the company is dependent upon the management and leadership of its four executive officers  michael p 
mack  david w 
qualls  r 
gregory keller and kenneth j 
keane 
the loss of any of these four individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of the company and its individual restaurants depends upon the company s ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified restaurant operations and other management personnel 
the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
see business restaurant operations restaurant management and business restaurant operations customer service 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business experiences seasonal fluctuations as a disproportionate amount of the company s net income is generally realized in the second  third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher average sales and lower average costs 
quarterly results have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income on a quarterly basis may fluctuate and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
see quarterly results and seasonality 
geographic concentration in california and florida  restaurant base thirty seven of the company s existing salad buffet restaurants are located in california and eighteen are located in florida 
accordingly  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in these regions  including natural disasters  such as hurricanes which have occurred annually in recent years in florida  or other acts of god that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s significant investment in  and long term commitment to  each of its restaurant sites limits its ability to respond quickly or effectively to changes in local competitive conditions or other changes that could affect the company s operations 
in addition  the company has a small number of restaurants relative to some of its competitors 
consequently  a decline in the profitability of an existing restaurant or the introduction of an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s result of operations than would be the case in a company with a larger number of restaurants 
see business restaurant facilities and business expansion strategy 
reliance on key suppliers and distributors the company utilizes sole source suppliers for certain produce and grocery items 
in addition  in order to minimize price fluctuations  the company enters into fixed price supply contracts that typically have terms of two months to one year and generally do not have minimum purchase requirements 
however  in the event that the company s suppliers are unable to make the required deliveries due to shortages or interruptions caused by adverse weather or other conditions or are relieved of their contract obligations due to an invocation of an act of god provision  the company would need to renegotiate these contracts or purchase such products and groceries elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that the company s produce and grocery costs would not as a result be higher  and such higher costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial conditions and results of operations 
the company has several local produce distributors and also distributes other grocery items through its own distribution system out of one warehouse on the west coast and one on the east coast 
all produce and groceries purchased by the company are channeled from the growers and other suppliers to the company s warehouses  restaurants and restaurant commissaries through these distributors 
in the event that any of these distributors were to cease distribution on behalf of the company  the company would be required to make alternate arrangements for produce 
there can be no assurance that the company s distribution expense would not be greater under such alternate arrangements 
see cost sensitivity and business restaurant operations 
legal matters the company is from time to time the subject of complaints  threat letters or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect the company and its restaurants  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether the company is liable 
the company is party to various legal actions relating to former employees 
in the opinion of management  after reviewing the information which is currently available with respect to these matters  and consulting with the company s counsel  any liability which may ultimately be incurred will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the company 
see legal proceedings 
government regulation the company s business is subject to and affected by various federal  state and local laws 
each restaurant must comply with state  county and municipal licensing and regulation requirements relating to health  safety  sanitation  building construction and fire prevention 
the company s restaurants are subject to federal and state laws governing wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime 
congress and various states including california passed proposals that imposed increases in state or federal minimum wages in    and there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to pass increased costs on to its guests 
the company is subject to the americans with disabilities act of  which requires certain accommodations to the company s restaurant designs to allow access for people with disabilities 
in addition  the company is subject to the regulations of the immigration and naturalization service ins 
given the location of many of the company s restaurants  even if the company s operation of those restaurants is in strict compliance with ins requirements  the company s employees may not all meet federal citizenship or residency requirements  which could lead to disruptions in its work force 
additionally  legislative proposals are currently under consideration by congress and state legislators to require employers to pay for health insurance for all employees 
anti takeover measures certain provisions of the company s restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of the company 
such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
certain of these provisions allow the company to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent and impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
the issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of the holders of the common stock 
in certain circumstances  such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated since the initial public offering of the common stock in may quarterly operating results of the company and other restaurant companies  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the restaurant industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
see market for company s common equity and related stockholder matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term interest rates as the company s line of credit is tied to the prime rate 
as of september   the company had million in debt outstanding under the credit facility 
based on a hypothetical basis point adverse change in prime rates  net interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise would decrease earnings and cash flows 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on debt  nor can there be any assurance that long term fixed rate debt will be available at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated results due to adverse changes in interest rates or debt availability 
the company did not have any foreign currency or other market risk or any derivative financial instruments at september
