as is generally the case in the recreational vehicle industry  various factors can influence sales 
these factors include demographics  changes in interest rates  competition  restrictions on the availability of financing for the purchase of recreational vehicles as well as significant changes in the availability and price of of gasoline 
the company s business is also seasonal in that normally the majority of sales occur in the second and third quarter 
prior to  the company operated two manufacturing divisions  lancaster  california and elkhart  indiana 
during  the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan of restructuring whereby the company implemented a plan to cease production operations at its elkhart  indiana manufacturing plant and potentially sell all or part of the real estate the facility occupied 
this decision was based upon the company s evaluation of costs and the product quality of the recreational vehicles being produced in elkhart 
concurrent with this decision  the company completed an expansion of its lancaster facility to accommodate the expected rise in production 
throughout the company retained its wholesale motorhome sales  warranty and service operations at the indiana production facility 
in december  the company sold the indiana facility 
two key transactions adversely impacted the company s results of operations during in addition to the aforementioned restructuring charge for the production closure of the elkhart facility  the company reached a settlement of an existing class action lawsuit against the company 
pursuant to the settlement  the company was required to pay  plus issue coupons to all members of the class for a discount of on future repairs or  towards the purchase of a new rexhall vehicle 
the company reported the impact from these transactions as charges in the accompanying statement of operations aggregating  for the restructuring and  for the lawsuit settlement during during  the company s restructuring effort was completed and  of the restructuring charge was reversed 
in the fourth quarter of   of the legal settlement was reversed as a result of less than expected coupon redemptions 
to counter the short term and long term effects of the bankruptcy of the company s largest dealer in  the company established it s own retail operations in mesa  arizona  price i  inc dba price one rv 
under the terms of the repurchase agreements with the bankrupt dealer s lenders  while the company was only obligated to repurchase million of motorhomes  they elected to repurchase million in order to keep this inventory from being dumped on the market at substantially lower prices 
as of december   the company had resold million of the repurchased inventory 
the retail operations at price one rv did not begin in earnest until october of  but management expects this to become a profitable venture for the company 
it is not certain how long the company will maintain its retail operations due to ever changing market conditions and government regulations 
result of operations comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december net revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the number of units shipped  net of repurchase units  in decreased to in from  in  a decrease of 
the average net selling price increased approximately during the period due to a higher mix of diesel units and units with double slides 
the decline in net revenues is primarily attributable to the first down market in years for class a motorhomes and the bankruptcy of the company s largest dealer 
management believes the driver of the overall down turn in the market is declining consumer confidence since the stock market started dropping in march of this triggered a domino effect that led to a tightening of credit for retail dealers and consumers 
management cannot determine when these conditions will improve 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for  a decrease of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the decrease in sales created a smaller absorption base for manufacturing overhead  which was the primary driver behind the decrease in gross margin 
manufacturing overhead includes costs such as depreciation  indirect labor  shop supplies  utilities  insurance  etc 
the nature of these costs is less variable than materials and labor  so overhead absorption suffers in periods of quickly declining base 
management believes that prudent steps were taken to reduce these costs as market conditions dictated  and this small decline in gross margin compares favorably to the rest of the industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
this reduction was primarily attributed to lower warranty costs and management s quick reaction to market conditions by holding these costs down 
despite those actions  the reduction in sales caused sg a to increase as a percent of net revenues from in to in the company s effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared with for basic and diluted net income per share was 
and 
respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to basic and diluted net income per share of and  respectively  in the decrease in basic and diluted net income per share was due to decreased net revenues and the effects of the legal settlement and gain on sale of fixed assets during  which were not a source of income in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the number of units shipped in increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
the average net selling price increased approximately during the period 
the increase in average per unit selling price results from a increase in diesel model sales over the prior year and continued increases in double slide unit sales 
the increases in these higher priced models were complimented by the strong demand for rexhall s lower priced vision and american clipper models  whose sales increased by over sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for  an increase of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the increase in gross profit remained steady as the company was able to hold most material costs stable and pass on the few increases that were necessary 
while there was no material change in production labor cost  the introduction of the millennium edition motorhome in late resulted in a temporary increase in direct labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for overall  sg a expense remained relatively unchanged from the prior year 
within this cost category several areas of cost increased in conjunction with sales but were offset by other reductions in cost 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from in to in results from the increased sales level while maintaining the level of administrative spending 
at december   the company s most significant obligations under the masterjohn legal settlement had been completed

forward looking statements our statements of our intentions or expectations are forward looking statements based on assumptions and on facts known to us today 
those assumptions will become less valid over time  but we do not intend to update this report 
rexhall s business is seasonal  and we are approaching the period when sales have usually declined 
low interest rates  low unemployment  and ready availability of motor fuel have in the past been associated with favorable recreational vehicle sales as has occurred in and however  the recent interest rate and gas prices increases  coupled with recent reports of decreased consumer confidence may reduce future sales levels 
the seriousness of a potential decline cannot be predicted 
many of rexhall s competitors are substantially larger  and of its suppliers and dealer s also have greater economic power so that the volume and prices of both supplies and sales may be adversely affected 
management intends to remain aware of these factors and react to them  but cannot predict their timing or significance 
item a quantitiative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of its business the company is exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
after an assessment of these risks to the company s operations  the company believes that its primary market risk exposures relating to interest rates within the meaning of regulation s k item are not material and are not expected to have any material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results or operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year 
the company s line of credit permits a combination of fixed and variable rates at the company s option  which management believes reduces the risk of interest fluctuations
