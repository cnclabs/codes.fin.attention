these decreases were partially offset by an increase in ip telephony semiconductor revenues resulting from the commercial release of our audacity t product in fiscal product revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a significant decrease in unit shipments of our consumer videophone systems and average selling prices asps realized on those shipments 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in unit shipments of our videoconferencing semiconductor and video monitoring system products 
license and other revenues consist primarily of technology licenses  including royalties earned pursuant to such licenses  and nonrecurring engineering fees for services performed by us for our customers 
license and other revenues for fiscal also included service revenues resulting from the integration of u force s professional services organization after the acquisition of u force in june license and other revenues increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to u force professional service revenues of million  offset by a decrease in royalties earned under a license agreement with ess technology  inc for certain of our video compression technology  which expired in october license and other revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from the million reported in fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in nonrecurring engineering fees 
revenues from our ten largest customers in the fiscal years ended march    and accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during the fiscal years ended march    and  no customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
sales to customers outside the united states represented   and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
specifically  sales to the asia pacific region represented   and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
our sales to europe represented   and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
cost of revenues and gross profit the cost of product revenues consists of costs associated with components  semiconductor wafer fabrication  system and semiconductor assembly and testing performed by third party vendors  and direct and indirect costs associated with purchasing  scheduling  and quality assurance 
gross profit from product revenues was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
product gross margin was for fiscal and fiscal  compared to in fiscal the million decrease in gross profit from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to a significant decrease in sales of our video monitoring and consumer videophone products due to our exit from those businesses 
gross profit in fiscal was also impacted by lower average selling prices asps realized on sales of our videoconferencing semiconductors  offset by a significant increase in ip telephony semiconductor sales 
the significant increase in product gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase in higher margin videoconferencing semiconductor and video monitoring system revenues and due to higher gross margins realized on sales of our viatv products 
in addition  fiscal gross profit and margins were significantly impacted by a million charge associated with the write off of viatv product inventory due to our decision to cease production of the viatv product line and withdraw from our distribution channels 
gross profit from license and other revenues  substantially all of which were nonrecurring  was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
associated gross margins were   and in fiscal   and the significant decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due to reduced margins associated with our professional service revenues in fiscal this was a result of lower than expected utilization of our professional services resources and the elimination of the professional services organization as part of the restructuring of our canadian operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  system prototype design and fabrication  mask  prototype wafer  and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development efforts 
research and development costs  including software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
higher research and development expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal were due primarily to increases in personnel  resulting from the acquisition of u force and increases in hosted ipbx development efforts  higher consulting expenses associated with the development of a graphical user interface for the hosted ipbx product  higher depreciation and maintenance expenses as a result of additional lab equipment and computer aided design tools  and increased stock compensation charges of approximately  related to stock option bonus programs 
higher research and development expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal were due primarily to increased spending related to hosted ipbx system software development 
significant expenses were also incurred in fiscal related to development efforts associated with the audacity t processor and media hub products 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources  and general management 
such costs also include advertising  sales commissions  trade show  and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses during the year ended march  as compared to the comparable period in the prior year is due primarily to a one time million charge related to the sale of million shares of our common stock to stmicroelectronics that we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge reflected the discount from the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the related agreement 
the decrease also reflects lower headcount and other costs required to support viatv and video monitoring sales  promotion  and support activities due to our exit from the consumer videophone and video monitoring businesses 
these decreases were substantially offset by increased expenses associated with the addition of the u force sales  marketing  finance  and corporate organizations  costs incurred related to our name change  and increased stock compensation charges 
the increase in expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of the million charge discussed above 
this increase was offset by lower costs associated with the marketing  advertising  and promotion of the viatv product line and lower headcount required to support these activities as we exited the consumer videophone business 
in process research and development and amortization of intangibles we incurred in process research and development charges of million in the first quarter of fiscal related to the acquisition of odisei sa odisei  and million in the second quarter of fiscal related to the acquisition of u force  inc u force 
a discussion of these acquisitions follows below 
u force  inc the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of u force  inc on june  for a total purchase price of million 
u force  based in montreal  canada  was a developer of ip based software applications and a provider of professional services 
u force was also developing a java based service creation environment sce that is designed to allow telecommunication service providers to develop  deploy  and manage telephony applications and services to their customers 
the purchase price was comprised of netergy common stock with a fair value of approximately million comprised of i  shares issued at closing of the acquisition  and ii  shares to be issued upon the exchange or redemption of the exchangeable shares the exchangeable shares of canadian entities held by former employee shareholders or indirect owners of u force stock 
the exchangeable shares held by u force employees are subject to certain restrictions  including our right to repurchase the exchangeable shares if an employee departs prior to vesting 
in addition  we also agreed to issue one share of preferred stock the special voting share that provides holders of exchangeable shares with voting rights that are equivalent to the shares of common stock into which their shares are convertible 
we also assumed outstanding stock options to purchase  shares of u force common stock for which the black scholes pricing model value of approximately million was included in the purchase price 
direct transaction costs related to the merger were approximately  the purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the book value of u force s assets and liabilities  which we believe approximated their fair value 
in addition  we engaged an independent appraiser to value the intangible assets  including amounts allocated to u force s in process research and development 
the in process research and development related to u force s initial products  the sce and a unified messaging application  for which technological feasibility had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
the estimated percentage complete for the unified messaging and sce products was approximately and  respectively  at june  the fair value of the in process technology was based on a discounted cash flow model  similar to the traditional income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value  net of tax 
in developing cash flow projections  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including estimated aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  characteristics of the potential market for the technology  and the anticipated life of the technology 
projected annual revenues for the in process research and development projects were assumed to ramp up initially and decline significantly at the end of the in process technology s economic life 
operating expenses and resulting profit margins were forecasted based on the characteristics and cash flow generating potential of the acquired in process technologies 
risks that were considered as part of the analysis included the scope of the efforts necessary to achieve technological feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
we also considered the risk that if we failed to bring the products to market in a timely manner  it could adversely affect sales and profitability of the combined company in the future 
the resulting estimated net cash flows were discounted at a rate of 
this discount rate was based on the estimated cost of capital plus an additional discount for the increased risk associated with in process technology 
based on the independent appraisal  the value of the acquired u force in process research and development  which was expensed in the second quarter of fiscal  approximated million 
the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
amounts allocated to goodwill  the value of an assumed distribution agreement  and workforce were being amortized on a straight line basis over three  three  and two years  respectively 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows in thousands in process research and development  distribution agreement  workforce  u force net tangible assets  goodwill  our consolidated financial statements include the results of the operations of u force from the date of the acquisition  june   the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal odisei sa in may  we acquired odisei  a privately held  development stage company based in sophia antipolis  france  that was developing software for managing voice over ip networks 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the acquisition of odisei on may  for approximately  shares of netergy s common stock and approximately  of contingent shares  which were subsequently issued to odisei employee shareholders in march approximately  of the shares issued to odisei employees are subject to repurchase as of march  if the employee departs prior to vesting 
the purchase price was approximately million  which includes approximately  of acquisition related costs 
the purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the book value of odisei s current assets and liabilities  which we believed approximated their fair value 
in addition  we engaged an independent appraiser to value the intangible assets  including amounts allocated to odisei s in process research and development 
the in process research and development related to odisei s initial product for which technological feasibility had not been established and was estimated to be approximately complete 
the fair value of the in process technology was based on a discounted cash flow model  which discounted expected future cash flows to present value  net of tax 
in developing cash flow projections  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including estimated aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  characteristics of the potential market for the technology  and the anticipated life of the technology 
projected annual revenues for the in process research and development projects were assumed to ramp up initially and decline significantly at the end of the in process technology s economic life 
operating expenses and resulting profit margins were forecasted based on the characteristics and estimated cash flow generating potential of the acquired in process technology 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in market conditions and technology 
the resulting estimated net cash flows were discounted at a rate of 
this discount rate was based on the estimated cost of capital plus an additional discount for the increased risk associated with in process technology 
based on the independent appraisal  the value of the acquired odisei in process research and development  which was expensed in the fiscal year ended march   was million 
the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
amounts allocated to goodwill and workforce are being amortized on a straight line basis over five and three years  respectively 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows in thousands in process research and development  workforce net tangible liabilities goodwill  our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended march  include the results of odisei from the date of acquisition 
amortization of intangible assets charged to operations was million and  during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  after a significant number of employees had resigned  we discontinued our canadian operations acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of u force in june we closed our offices in montreal and hull  quebec and laid off all remaining employees resulting in the cessation of most of the research and development efforts and all of the sales and marketing and professional services activities associated with the u force business 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a one time charge of million in the quarter ended march  the restructuring charges consisted of the following in thousands employee separation fixed asset losses and impairments  intangible asset impairments  lease obligation and termination employee separation costs represent severance payments related to the employees in the montreal and hull offices who were laid off 
the impairment charges for fixed assets of approximately million included write offs of abandoned and unusable assets of approximately million  a loss on sale of assets of  and a charge for assets to be disposed of  the loss on sale of assets of  was attributable to the sale of office  computer  and other equipment of the montreal office 
we received common stock of the purchaser valued at approximately  as of the date of sale 
fair value of assets to be disposed was measured based on expected salvage value  less costs to sell 
these assets are expected to be sold or abandoned  depending on re sale market conditions  within the next six to twelve months 
the impairment charges for intangible assets represented the write off of the unamortized intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of u force 
the charges of approximately million included million for the goodwill related to the acquisition   for the assembled workforce  and  related to a distribution agreement 
the impairments were directly attributable to the cessation of operations in canada 
we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the intangible assets related to these operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the lack of estimated future net cash flows related to the acquired products necessitated an impairment charge to write off the remaining unamortized goodwill 
the distribution agreement asset was written off because we will no longer provide products and services to customers under that agreement 
in march we terminated the lease for our primary facility in montreal 
pursuant to the lease termination agreement  we are obligated to pay rent on the montreal facility through may  we recorded charges for this rental obligation as well as the related lease termination costs 
we are actively seeking a third party to sublet our vacant facility in hull  quebec  and have recorded a charge for estimated lease termination and related costs 
cash payments related to the restructuring  which included all employee separation costs and certain lease termination costs  approximated  during our fourth fiscal quarter ended march  as of march   the remaining estimated cash requirements of approximately  are related to lease obligations and anticipated lease termination costs 
the restructuring and discontinuation of our canadian operations will reduce our operating expenses and cash used in operations beginning in fiscal from june  date of acquisition of u force to march   we incurred operating expenses  excluding restructuring charges  of approximately million  and net cash outflows of approximately million related to our canadian operations 
as a result of the cessation of operations in canada  we do not expect to incur significant related operating expenses or cash outflows in fiscal other income  net in fiscal   and  other income  net  was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million decrease in gains realized from the sale of equity investments  offset by an increase in interest income resulting from higher average cash equivalent and short term investment balances as compared to fiscal the increase in other income  net  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million gain realized from the sale of an equity investment  offset by approximately  of losses realized on the sale of certain of investments classified as available for sale 
interest expense interest expense increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to an increase in interest charges and amortization of both the debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with the convertible subordinated debentures issued in december provision for income taxes the provisions of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively  represent certain foreign taxes 
there was no tax provision for the year ended march  due to the net losses incurred 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in while the california credit will carryforward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  the weight of objective available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  and thus a full valuation allowance was recorded at march  and march  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force reached several conclusions regarding the accounting for debt and equity securities with beneficial conversion features  including a consensus requiring the application of the accounting conversion price method  versus the use of the stated conversion price  to calculate the beneficial conversion feature for such securities 
the securities and exchange commission required companies to record a cumulative catch up adjustment in the fourth quarter of calendar related to the application of the accounting conversion price method to securities issued after may  accordingly  we recorded a million non cash expense during the quarter ended december  to account for a beneficial conversion feature associated with the convertible subordinated debentures and related warrants issued in december  and we have presented it as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
we are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal pursuant to the issuance of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date of sfas by one year 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which amends certain terms and conditions of sfas we do not expect that the adoption of sfas  as amended  will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  representing a decrease of million from march  we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  decreases in accounts payable and accrued compensation of million and  an increase in other current and non current assets of million  and a non cash adjustment for a gain on sale of investments of  cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of  an increase in other accrued liabilities of  and non cash items  including restructuring charges of million  depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development of million  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  and stock compensation charges of  cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of assets and the license of technology associated with our video monitoring line of million  offset by acquisitions of property and equipment of million and cash paid for acquisitions  net  of  cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of the company s common stock totaling million  offset by debt repayments of  and repurchases of common stock and exchangeable shares of  for the year  cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  and a non cash adjustment for a gain on sale of investments  net  of million 
cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of million  and non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development of million  and discount on issuance of common stock of million 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is attributable to proceeds from the sale of an investment of million  offset by acquisitions of property and equipment of million and cash paid for acquisitions  net  of  cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated debentures of million and sales of the company s common stock totaling million  offset by debt issuance costs of  for the year  cash and cash equivalents increased million 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in accounts payable of  cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in inventory of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and non cash items  including stock compensation expense of  and depreciation and amortization of  cash used in investing activities in fiscal is primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of net proceeds from the repayment of stockholders notes receivable and sales of the company s common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
as of march   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under noncancelable operating leases 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations  if any  will satisfy our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
we may  however  need additional working capital shortly thereafter 
accordingly  we may raise additional financing at some point during the next twelve months in order to meet our cash requirements for fiscal we will be evaluating financing alternatives prior to that time 
we may also seek to explore business opportunities  including acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or products that will require additional capital from equity or debt sources 
additionally  the development and marketing of new products could require a significant commitment of resources  which could in turn require us to obtain additional financing earlier than otherwise expected 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing as needed on acceptable terms  or at all  which may require us to reduce our operating costs and other expenditures  including reductions of personnel and suspension of salary increases and capital expenditures 
alternatively  or in addition to such potential measures  we may elect to implement other cost reduction actions as we may determine are necessary and in our best interests  including the possible sale or cessation of certain of our business lines 
any such actions undertaken might limit our opportunities to realize plans for revenue growth and we might not be able to reduce our costs in amounts sufficient to achieve break even or profitable operations 
factors that may affect future results we may need to raise additional capital to support our growth  and failure to do so in a timely manner may cause us to delay our plans for growth or cause us to implement additional cost reduction strategies as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations  if any  will satisfy our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may  however  need additional working capital shortly thereafter 
accordingly  we may seek additional financing at some point during the next twelve months in order to meet our cash requirements in fiscal we may also seek to explore business opportunities  including acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or products that will require additional capital from equity or debt sources 
additionally  the development and marketing of new products could require a significant commitment of resources  which could in turn require us to obtain additional financing earlier than otherwise expected 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing as needed on acceptable terms  or at all  which may require us to reduce our operating costs and other expenditures  including reductions of personnel and suspension of salary increases and capital expenditures 
alternatively  or in addition to such potential measures  we may elect to implement other cost reduction actions as we may determine are necessary and in our best interests  including the possible sale or cessation of certain of our business lines 
any such actions undertaken might limit our opportunities to realize plans for revenue growth and we might not be able to reduce our costs in amounts sufficient to achieve break even or profitable operations 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
we have a history of losses and we are uncertain as to our future profitability we recorded an operating loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  and had an accumulated deficit of million at march  in addition  we recorded operating losses for the fiscal years ended march  and we expect that netergy  as well as its subsidiaries individually  will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  and such losses may be substantial 
we will need to generate significant revenue growth to achieve profitability 
given our history of fluctuating revenues and operating losses  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve profitability on either a quarterly or annual basis 
the growth of our business and future profitability depends on future ip telephony revenue we believe that our business and future profitability will be largely dependent on widespread market acceptance of our ip telephony products 
our videoconferencing semiconductor business has not provided  nor is it expected to provide  sufficient revenues to profitably operate our business 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from the sale of our ip telephony products 
if we are not able to generate significant revenues selling into the ip telephony market  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
success of our ip telephony product strategy assumes that there will be future demand for ip telephony systems 
in order for the ip telephony market to continue to grow  several things need to occur 
telephone service providers must continue to invest in the deployment of high speed broadband networks to residential and commercial customers 
ip networks must improve quality of service for real time communications  managing effects such as packet jitter  packet loss  and unreliable bandwidth  so that toll quality service can be provided 
ip telephony equipment must achieve the reliability that users of the pstn have come to expect from their telephone service 
ip telephony service providers must offer cost and feature benefits to their customers that are sufficient to cause the customers to switch away from traditional telephony service providers 
if any or all of these factors fail to occur  our business may not grow 
our future operating results may not follow past or expected trends due to many factors and any of these could cause our stock price to fall our historical operating results have fluctuated significantly and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future  and a decline in our operating results could cause our stock price to fall 
on an annual and a quarterly basis  there are a number of factors that may affect our operating results  many of which are outside our control 
these include  but are not limited to changes in market demand  the timing of customer orders  competitive market conditions  lengthy sales cycles and or regulatory approval cycles  new product introductions by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  the management of inventory  the level of international sales  continued compliance with industry standards  and general economic conditions 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including  product mix  the recognition of license and other revenues for which there may be little or no corresponding cost of revenues  product pricing  the allocation between international and domestic sales  the percentage of direct sales and sales to resellers  and manufacturing and component costs 
the markets for our products are characterized by falling average selling prices 
we expect that  as a result of competitive pressures and other factors  gross profit as a percentage of revenue for our videoconferencing semiconductor products will continue to decrease for the foreseeable future 
average selling prices asps realized to date for our ip telephony semiconductors have been lower than those historically attained for our multimedia communication semiconductor products resulting in lower gross margins 
in the likely event that we encounter significant price competition in the markets for our products  we could be at a significant disadvantage compared to our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources  and therefore may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
variations in timing of sales may cause significant fluctuations in future operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business may be derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  including oem customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
anticipated orders from customers may fail to materialize 
delivery schedules may be deferred or canceled for a number of reasons  including changes in specific customer requirements or international economic conditions 
the adverse impact of a shortfall in our revenues may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for such shortfall 
announcements by our competitors or us of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products  which would also have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
as a result of these and other factors  it is likely that in some or all future periods our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which would likely result in a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to manage our inventory levels effectively  which may lead to inventory obsolescence that would force us to lower our prices our products have lead times of up to several months  and are built to forecasts that are necessarily imprecise 
because of our practice of building our products to necessarily imprecise forecasts  it is likely that  from time to time  we will have either excess or insufficient product inventory 
excess inventory levels would subject us to the risk of inventory obsolescence and the risk that our selling prices may drop below our inventory costs  while insufficient levels of inventory may negatively affect relations with customers 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we depend on purchase orders from key customers and failure to receive significant purchase orders in the future would cause a decline in our operating results historically  a significant portion of our sales has been to relatively few customers  although the composition of these customers has varied 
revenues from our ten largest customers for the fiscal years ended march    and accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of total revenues 
substantially all of our product sales have been made  and are expected to continue to be made  on a purchase order basis 
none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
in the future  we will need to gain purchase orders for our products to earn additional revenue 
further  substantially all of our license and other revenues are nonrecurring 
the ip telephony market is subject to rapid technological change and we depend on new product introduction in order to maintain and grow our business ip telephony is an emerging market that is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent introductions of new and enhanced products  and continuing and rapid technological advancement 
to compete successfully in this emerging market  we must continue to design  develop  manufacture  and sell new and enhanced semiconductor and ip telephony software products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost 
these new and enhanced products must take advantage of technological advancements and changes  and respond to new customer requirements 
our success in designing  developing  manufacturing  and selling such products will depend on a variety of factors  including the identification of market demand for new products  product and feature selection  timely implementation of product design and development  product performance  cost effectiveness of products under development  effective manufacturing processes  and success of promotional efforts 
additionally  we may also be required to collaborate with third parties to develop our products and may not be able to do so on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays will likely occur in the future 
if we are unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  if such new or enhanced products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance  or if such new product introductions decrease demand for existing products  our operating results would decline and our business would not grow 
the long and variable sales and deployment cycles for our ip telephony software products may cause our revenue and operating results to vary our ip telephony software products  including our hosted ipbx and sce products  have lengthy sales cycles  and we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort without making a sale 
a customer s decision to purchase our products often involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy product evaluation and qualification process 
in addition  the length of our sales cycles will vary depending on the type of customer to whom we are selling and the product being sold 
even after making the decision to purchase our products  our customers may deploy our products slowly 
timing of deployment can vary widely and will depend on various factors  including the size of the network deployment  the complexity of our customers network environments  our customers skill sets  the hardware and software configuration and customization necessary to deploy our products  and our customers ability to finance their purchase of our products 
as a result  it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which our customers may purchase our products  and our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  orders for our products will be delayed or canceled and substantial product returns could occur  which could harm our business many of the potential customers for our hosted ipbx and unified messaging products have requested that our products be designed to interoperate with their existing networks  each of which may have different specifications and use multiple standards 
our customers networks may contain multiple generations of products from different vendors that have been added over time as their networks have grown and evolved 
our products must interoperate with these products as well as with future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
in some cases  we may be required to modify our product designs to achieve a sale  which may result in a longer sales cycle  increased research and development expense  and reduced operating margins 
if our products do not interoperate with existing equipment or software in our customers networks  installations could be delayed  orders for our products could be canceled or our products could be returned 
this could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
intense competition in the markets in which we compete could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue and prevent us from achieving profitability we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or new technologies 
if our competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the sales or market acceptance of our products and services  increase price competition or make our products obsolete 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing  and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive  which in turn will cause our business to suffer 
in addition  our focus on developing a range of technology products  including semiconductors and related embedded software  hosted ipbx solutions  and service creation software  places a significant strain on our research and development resources 
competitors that focus on one aspect of technology  such as software or semiconductors  may have a considerable advantage over us 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  are substantially larger  and have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  technical  and other resources 
for example  certain competitors in the market for our semiconductor products maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
many also have greater name recognition and a larger installed base of products than us 
competition in our markets may result in significant price reductions 
as a result of their greater resources  many current and potential competitors may be better able than us to initiate and withstand significant price competition or downturns in the economy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively  and any failure to do so would harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if we do not develop and maintain successful partnerships for ip telephony products  we may not be able to successfully market our solutions we are entering into new market areas and our success is partly dependent on our ability to forge new marketing and engineering partnerships 
ip telephony communication systems are extremely complex and no single company possesses all the required technology components needed to build a complete end to end solution 
we will likely need to enter into partnerships to augment our development programs and to assist us in marketing complete solutions to our targeted customers 
we may not be able to develop such partnerships in the course of our product development 
even if we do establish the necessary partnerships  we may not be able to adequately capitalize on these partnerships to aid in the success of our business 
inability to protect our proprietary technology or our infringement of a third party s proprietary technology would disrupt our business we rely in part on trademark  copyright  and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and abroad 
we seek to protect our software  documentation  and other written materials under trade secret and copyright law  which afford only limited protection 
we also rely in part on patent law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
as of march   we held forty united states patents  including patents relating to programmable integrated circuit architectures  telephone control arrangements  software structures  and memory architecture technology  and had a number of united states and foreign patent applications pending 
we cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in issued patents 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in the united states or internationally where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited  and competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around any patent of ours 
we have in the past licensed and in the future expect to continue licensing our technology to others  many of who are located or may be located abroad 
there are no assurances that such licensees will protect our technology from misappropriation 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
there has been substantial litigation in the semiconductor  electronics  and related industries regarding intellectual property rights  and from time to time third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
our broad range of technology  including systems  digital and analog circuits  software  and semiconductors  increases the likelihood that third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
if we were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities for such infringement  which could be material 
we could also be required to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in these discussions and actions or that other actions alleging infringement by the company of third party patents will not be asserted or prosecuted against the company 
we rely on certain technology  including hardware and software licensed from third parties 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  existing licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  we may be required to license technology from third parties in the future to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain third party licenses required to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
continued reductions in levels of capital investment by telecommunication service providers might impact our ability to increase revenue and prevent us from achieving profitability the market for the services provided by telecommunication service providers who compete against traditional telephone companies has only begun to emerge  and many of these service providers are still building their infrastructure and rolling out their services 
these telecommunication service providers require substantial capital for the development  construction  and expansion of their networks and the introduction of their services 
financing may not be available to emerging telecommunication service providers on favorable terms  if at all 
the inability of our current or potential emerging telecommunication service provider customers to acquire and keep customers  to successfully raise needed funds  or to respond to any other trends such as price reductions for their services or diminished demand for telecommunication services generally  could adversely affect their operating results or cause them to reduce their capital spending programs 
if our current or potential customers are forced to defer or curtail their capital spending programs  sales of our hosted ipbx and sce products to those telecommunication service providers may be adversely affected  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  many of the industries in which telecommunication service providers operate have recently experienced consolidation 
the loss of one or more of our current or potential telecommunication service provider customers  through industry consolidation or otherwise  could reduce or eliminate our sales to such a customer and consequently harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the failure of ip networks to meet the reliability and quality standards required for voice communications could render our products obsolete circuit switched telephony networks feature very high reliability  with a guaranteed quality of service 
the common standard for reliability of carrier grade real time voice communications is  meaning that the network can be down for only a few minutes per year 
in addition  such networks have imperceptible delay and consistently satisfactory audio quality 
emerging broadband ip networks  such as lans  wans  and the internet  or emerging last mile technologies such as cable  dsl  and wireless local loop  may not be used for telephony unless such networks and technologies can provide reliability and quality consistent with these standards 
our products must comply with industry standards and fcc regulations  and changes may require us to modify existing products in addition to reliability and quality standards  the market acceptance of telephony over broadband ip networks is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other 
ip telephony products rely heavily on standards such as h  sip  sgcp  mgcp  h 
gcp  and megaco to interoperate with other vendors equipment 
there is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application  and about the definition of the standards themselves 
we also must comply with certain rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc regarding electromagnetic radiation and safety standards established by underwriters laboratories as well as similar regulations and standards applicable in other countries 
standards are continuously being modified and replaced 
as standards evolve  we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with various existing and evolving industry standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our ip telephony products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future regulation or legislation of the internet could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business at present there are few laws or regulations that specifically address access to or commerce on the internet  including ip telephony 
we are unable to predict the impact  if any  that future legislation  legal decisions or regulations concerning the internet may have on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regulation may be targeted towards  among other things  assessing access or settlement charges  imposing tariffs or imposing regulations based on encryption concerns or the characteristics and quality of products and services  any of which could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business 
the increasing growth of the broadband ip telephony market and popularity of broadband ip telephony products and services heighten the risk that governments will seek to regulate broadband ip telephony and the internet 
in addition  large  established telecommunication companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of the broadband ip telephony market  which may be contrary to our interests 
we may transition to smaller geometry process technologies and higher levels of design integration  which could disrupt our business we continuously evaluate the benefits  on an integrated circuit  product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to reduce costs related to the development and production of our semiconductors 
we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important for us to remain competitive 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes  which has resulted and could continue to result in reduced yields  delays in product deliveries  and increased expense levels 
moreover  we are dependent on relationships with our foundries and their partners to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented  we may experience delays in product introductions and incur increased expenses 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
we cannot predict whether higher levels of design integration or the use of third party intellectual property will adversely affect our ability to deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
we depend on subcontracted manufacturers to manufacture substantially all of our products  and any delay or interruption in manufacturing by these contract manufacturers would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may harm our business we outsource the manufacturing of our semiconductor products to independent foundries 
our primary semiconductor manufacturer is taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation tsmc 
while tsmc has been a valuable and capable supplier  there are no assurances or supply contracts guaranteeing that they will continue to supply us with our required wafer supply 
furthermore  taiwan is always subject to geological or geopolitical disturbances that could instantly cut off such supply 
we also rely on other third party manufacturers for packaging and testing of our semiconductors 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with our subcontract manufacturers or our component suppliers 
there can be no assurance that our subcontract manufacturers will be able or willing to reliably manufacture our products  in volumes  on a cost effective basis or in a timely manner 
for our semiconductor products  the time to port our technology to another foundry  the time to qualify the new versions of product  and the cost of this effort as well as the tooling associated with wafer production would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if we discover product defects  we may have product related liabilities which may cause us to lose revenues or delay market acceptance of our products products as complex as those we offer frequently contain errors  defects  and functional limitations when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced such errors  defects or functional limitations 
we sell products into markets that are extremely demanding of robust  reliable  fully functional products 
therefore  delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of such products  which could damage our credibility with our customers and adversely affect our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  such errors  defects or functional limitations could cause problems  interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
alleviating such problems may require significant expenditures of capital and resources by us 
despite our testing  our suppliers or our customers may find errors  defects or functional limitations in new products after commencement of commercial production 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  product repair or replacement costs  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we have significant international operations  which subject us to risks that could cause our operating results to decline sales to customers outside of the united states represented   and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
specifically  sales to customers in the asia pacific region represented   and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively  while sales to customers in europe represented   and of our total revenues for the same periods  respectively 
substantially all of our current semiconductor and system level products are  and substantially all of our future products will be  manufactured  assembled  and tested by independent third parties in foreign countries 
international sales and manufacturing are subject to a number of risks  including general economic conditions in regions such as asia  changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunication standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations 
we are also subject to geopolitical risks  such as political  social  and economic instability  potential hostilities  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with our international operations 
a significant decline in demand from foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we need to hire and retain key personnel to support our products the development and marketing of our ip telephony products will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel  management  and other resources 
competition for highly skilled engineering  sales  marketing  and support personnel is intense because there are a limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our market  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are principally located 
any failure to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth 
we currently do not have employment contracts with nor maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we are involved in a litigation matter that could seriously harm our financial condition on april   we  along with sun microsystems  inc  netscape communications canada inc  burntsand inc  and intraware canada inc  were sued by milinx business services  inc and milinx business group inc 
collectively  milinx in the supreme court of british columbia  canada the court 
milinx has alleged that we failed to perform certain contractual obligations and knowingly misrepresented the capabilities of its products 
the lawsuit seeks general  special  and aggravated damages totaling in excess of canadian million plus interest  costs  and any other relief which the court may choose to provide 
we believe we have valid defenses against the claims alleged by milinx and intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously 
however  due to the nature of litigation and because the lawsuit is in the very early pre discovery stages  we cannot determine the possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred either in the context of a trial or a negotiated settlement 
should we not prevail in any such litigation  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
our stock price has been highly volatile the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
it may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technical innovations  loss of key personnel  new products or new contracts by us  our competitors or their customers  and developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general market conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and other factors which could be unrelated to  or outside our control 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against the issuing company 
if our stock price is volatile  we may also be subject to such litigation 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would disrupt business and could cause a decline in our operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
the location of our headquarters facility subjects us to the risk of earthquakes our corporate headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers in europe and asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  the vast majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  all of our arrangements with our semiconductor foundry and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have foreign subsidiaries and are thus exposed to market risk from changes in exchange rates 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
we invest our surplus cash and cash equivalents in money market funds that bear variable interest rates  and  accordingly  fluctuations in interest rates do not have an impact on the fair values of such investments
