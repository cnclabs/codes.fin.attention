the branded product program enables foodservice operators to offer nathans hot dogs and other proprietary items for sale within their facilities 
in conjunction with this program  foodservice operators are granted a limited use of the nathans trademark with respect to the sale of hot dogs and certain other proprietary food items and paper goods

cash used in investing activities of  is comprised primarily of  relating to capital improvements of company owned restaurants and other fixed asset additions  lease termination costs and other costs of  pursuant to our final divestiture plan in connection with our acquisition of miami subs  cash received on notes receivable of  and proceeds from the sale of assets of  cash used in financing activities of  represents repayments of notes payable and obligations under capital leases 
in connection with our acquisition of miami subs  we determined that up to underperforming restaurants would be closed pursuant to our divestiture plan 
to date  we have terminated leases on of those properties 
we are continuing to market two of the remaining properties for sale and will terminate the lease for the last unit upon the lease expiration in may as of march   we have accrued approximately  for lease reserves and termination costs  as part of the acquisition  for units with total future minimum lease obligations of  with remaining lease terms of year up to approximately years 
we may incur future cash payments  consisting primarily of future lease payments including costs and expenses associated with terminating additional leases that were not part of our divestiture plan 
on may   pursuant to an order of condemnation  we sold a company owned restaurant to the state of florida for  and repaid the outstanding mortgage of approximately  plus accrued interest 
additionally  in june  we expect to sell our restaurant in the paramus park mall to a franchisee for  in cash and concurrently enter into a sub lease for the property 
we expect that we will reinvest in certain existing restaurants in the future and that we will fund those investments from our operating cash flow 
we do not currently expect to incur significant capital expenditures to develop new company owned restaurants 
we also guarantee certain equipment financing for franchisees with a third party lender 
our maximum obligation for loans funded by the lender as of march  was approximately million 
management believes that available cash  marketable investment securities  and internally generated funds should provide sufficient capital to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we maintain a  uncommitted bank line of credit and have not borrowed any funds to date under this line of credit 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations  the effects of weather and economic conditions 
historically  sales and earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in our marketplace for our company owned nathan s stores  which is principally the new york metropolitan area 
miami subs restaurant sales have historically been strongest during the period march through august  which approximates our first and second quarters  as a result of a heavy concentration of restaurants being located in florida 
as a result  we believe that future revenues may become slightly more seasonal 
impact of inflation during the past several years  our commodity costs have remained relatively stable 
as such  we believe that inflation has not materially impacted earnings during that period of time 
last year we experienced increased costs of our meat products and utilities resulting from increased commodity costs 
we also experienced increased costs for insurance attributable to the hardening of the insurance markets 
last year  various legislators proposed additional changes to the minimum wage requirements 
during  different bills were passed by the senate and the house of representatives proposing to further increase the federal minimum wage  although  no legislation was passed 
at this time  there are no pending federal minimum wage proposals  however  we believe that there will be continued pressure to pass new federal minimum wage legislation in the future 
we further believe that any further increases in the minimum wage could have a significant financial impact on us 
prolonged increases in labor  food and other operating expenses could adversely affect our operations and those of the restaurant industry and we might have to reconsider our pricing strategy as a means to offset reduced operating margins

forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements represent our current judgment regarding future events 
although we would not make forward looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so  we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties  many of which we are not aware 
these risks and uncertainties  many of which are not within our control  include  but are not limited to economic  weather  legislative and business conditions  the availability of suitable restaurant sites on reasonable rental terms  changes in consumer tastes  ability to continue to attract franchisees  the ability to purchase its primary food and paper products at reasonable prices  no material increases in the minimum wage  and our ability to attract competent restaurant and managerial personnel

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in short term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments which are reinvested when they mature throughout the year 
although our existing investments are not considered at risk with respect to changes in interest rates or markets for these instruments  our rate of return on short term investments could be affected at the time or reinvestment as a result of intervening events 
we have invested our marketable investment securities in intermediate term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments and a highly liquid investment limited partnership that invests principally in equities 
these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the performance of the equity markets 
the interest rate on our borrowings are generally determined based upon prime rate and may be subject to market fluctuation as the prime rate changes as determined within each specific agreement 
we do not anticipate entering into interest rate swaps or other financial instruments to hedge our borrowings 
the cost of commodities are subject to market fluctuation 
we have not attempted to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we purchase using future  forward  option or other instruments 
as a result  our future commodities purchases are subject to changes in the prices of such commodities 
foreign franchisees generally conduct business with us and make payments in  united states dollars  reducing the risks inherent with changes in the values of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have not purchased future contracts  options or other instruments to hedge against changes in values of foreign currencies
