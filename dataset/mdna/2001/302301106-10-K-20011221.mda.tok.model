item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis compares the results of operations for the month periods ending september    and fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
for purposes of management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  all comparisons reflect the pro forma effects of applying the new accounting principle described below to the consolidated financial statements as if the change had occurred on september  summary financial data fiscal years ended september pro forma dollars in thousands  except as indicated operations sales    service charges    total revenues    cost of sales    net revenues    restructuring expense  income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle   cumulative effect on prior years to september  of change in method of revenue recognition  net  net income loss   other data gross margin average annual inventory turnover x x x average inventory per location at year end average loan balance per location at year end average pawn loan at year end whole dollars average yield on loan portfolio redemption rate expenses and income as a percentage of total revenue store operating administrative depreciation and amortization interest income loss before income taxes income loss before cumulative effect stores in operation beginning of year acquired new openings sold  combined  or closed end of year average number of locations during the year average locations in operation during the period is calculated based on the average of the stores operating at the beginning and end of each month during such period 
results of operations in fiscal  the company adopted a restructuring plan  including the closure of several under performing stores 
the restructuring plan and its effects are described more fully below 
the company s primary activity is the making of small  non recourse loans secured by tangible personal property 
the income earned on this activity is pawn service charge revenue 
while the company s average store count during fiscal was down from fiscal due to the restructuring  its pawn service charge revenue decreased only  or million from fiscal to million 
this represents an increase in same store pawn service charge revenue million offset by the decrease in pawn service charge revenue from the forty seven closed stores million 
at september   same store pawn loan balances were above september  and the annualized yield on the average pawn loan balance decreased percentage points to 
variations in the annualized loan yield  as we saw between these periods  are due generally to changes in the level of loan forfeitures and a mix shift between loans with different yields 
in fiscal  pawn service charge revenue decreased million from fiscal to million as a result of a decrease in same store pawn service charge revenue million  offset somewhat by pawn service charge revenue from new stores not open the full month period million 
at september   same store pawn loan balances were below september  and the annualized yield on the average pawn loan balance increased by percentage points to 
a secondary  but related  activity of the company is the sale of merchandise  primarily collateral forfeited from its pawn lending 
for fiscal  merchandise sales decreased approximately million from fiscal to million  primarily due to a reduction in sales from closed stores million 
also contributing to the change were increases in wholesale jewelry sales million  offset by a decrease in same store merchandise sales million or  and other revenues million 
for fiscal  merchandise sales increased approximately million from fiscal to million 
increases in wholesale jewelry sales million  new stores merchandise sales million  and other revenues million were offset by a decrease in same store merchandise sales million or 
fiscal overall gross margins on sales improved percentage points from fiscal to 
margins on merchandise sales  excluding jewelry scrapping  improved percentage points  partially due to the absence of a restructuring charge to cost of goods as was seen in fiscal percentage points 
this improvement in merchandise sales margins comprised percentage points of the improvement in overall gross margins 
a increase in jewelry scrapping jewelry is generally scrapped at a loss  reduced the overall gross margins improvement by percentage points 
inventory shrinkage was of merchandise sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal for fiscal  gross margins on merchandise sales decreased percentage points from fiscal to 
this decrease was largely due to the impact of increased jewelry scrapping activity percentage points  and the charge to cost of goods related to the fourth quarter restructuring discussed above of a percentage point 
improved margins on merchandise sales percentage points and lower levels of inventory shrinkage in fiscal v 
in fiscal partially offset the impact from jewelry scrapping and the restructuring charge 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  the company identified and liquidated specific categories of jewelry that were overstocked 
this excess inventory had a cost basis of approximately million and generated cash proceeds of approximately million 
at the end of fiscal  the company also offered unsecured short term loans  commonly referred to as payday loans in of its pawnshops 
in five locations  the company originates short term loans 
in locations  the company is the marketer  servicer  processor  and collector of short term loans originated by county bank  a federally insured delaware banking corporation 
after origination of the short term loans  the company is entitled to purchase an participation in the loans made by county bank and marketed by the company 
short term loan terms range from one to days  averaging about days 
the fee per loaned is typically per day period  but varies in certain locations 
the loans and related fees reported in the company s consolidated financial statements reflect only the company s participation interest in such loans 
in fiscal  short term loan service charge revenue increased million from fiscal to million as a result of offering the short term loan product in additional locations 
unlike pawn loans  short term loans are unsecured  and their profitability is highly dependent upon the company s ability to manage the default rate and collect defaulted loans 
the company considers a loan defaulted if the loan has not been repaid or refinanced by the maturity date 
although defaulted loans may be collected through subsequent collection efforts  the company charges defaulted loans and related fees to bad debt expense when they default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
when defaulted loans are collected  the amount collected is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense at the time of collection 
during fiscal  the company experienced a net default rate defaults net of collections measured as a percent of loans made of 
the company provides for a valuation allowance on both the principal and fees receivable  based on recent net default rates 
net defaults and changes in the principal valuation allowance are charged to bad debt expense 
in fiscal  the company s bad debt expense  included in store operating expense  was million 
changes to the fee receivable valuation allowance are charged to service charge revenue 
in fiscal  store operating expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased percentage points to 
administrative expenses measured as a percentage of total revenues decreased percentage points from fiscal to 
this expense level improvement is largely due to improved cost management and the closure of lower volume stores 
on a per average store basis  operating expenses in fiscal were up slightly to  from  in fiscal administrative expenses per average store decreased during fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  store operating expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased of a percentage point from fiscal to 
exclusive of stores opened in fiscal and  store operating expenses decreased from in fiscal to of total revenues in fiscal newer stores generally have a higher level of operating expense relative to revenues than do mature stores 
administrative expenses measured as a percentage of total revenues increased percentage points from fiscal to  primarily due to non capitalizable software development costs approximately million  higher labor related costs  and other inflationary cost increases 
depreciation and amortization expense  when measured as a percent of total revenue  increased of a percentage point in fiscal to  primarily due to additional software depreciation 
depreciation and amortization expense  when measured as a percent of total revenue  increased of a percentage point in fiscal to 
the increase was a net effect of greater revenues and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  primarily due to investments made in new stores 
in fiscal  interest expense increased million to million 
the increase was primarily due to higher interest rates  offset somewhat by lower average debt balances 
at september   the company s total long term debt was million compared to million at september  in fiscal  interest expense increased million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher interest rates coupled with increased average debt balances needed to fund new store expansion and other capital expenditures 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was million of pretax loss compared to an income tax benefit of million of pretax loss for fiscal and an income tax expense of million of pretax income for fiscal exclusive of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the fiscal income tax benefit was million of pretax loss 
the decrease in effective tax rate for fiscal compared to the fiscal benefit before valuation allowance is due to non tax deductible items having a greater percentage effect on a smaller pre tax loss 
a valuation allowance of million was established during the year ended september   to offset certain deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the realization of the deferred tax assets 
no additional valuation allowance was recorded for the year ended september   because management believes that it is more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of expected future taxable income from continuing operations 
uncertainties that might impact the realization of the deferred tax assets include possible declines in sales  margins and revenues 
the amount of expected future taxable income that would have to be generated to realize the deferred tax asset is approximately million 
projected levels of pre tax earnings for financial reporting purposes over the next three years  primarily attributable to ordinary and recurring operating results  are sufficient to generate the required amount of taxable income noted above 
the company intends to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for additional valuation allowance  if any 
operating income before depreciation  amortization  and restructuring for fiscal increased million over fiscal to million 
same store net revenue growth million  expense management million and the closure of under performing stores million account for the earnings improvement 
after depreciation  amortization  interest expense  the fiscal restructuring charge  and other non operating items  the fiscal net loss improved to million from fiscal s million net loss before the million cumulative effect of the accounting change adopted in fiscal net loss for fiscal was million compared to net income of million for fiscal  assuming the effect of the cumulative change in accounting principle is applied retroactively 
the increase in net loss resulted from several factors  including the cumulative effect of changing to a preferable revenue recognition method million  recognition of a restructuring charge million  lower gross margins on merchandise sales million  the establishment of a valuation reserve on the company s deferred tax asset million  and higher operating  administrative  and interest expenses 
accounting change during the second quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of revenue recognition on pawn loans by reducing the accrual of pawn service charge revenues to the estimated amount that will be realized through loan collection  and recording forfeited collateral at the lower of the principal balance of the loan or estimated market value 
previously  pawn service charges were accrued on all loans  and the carrying value of the forfeited collateral was the lower of cost principal amount of loan plus accrued pawn service charges or market 
the company believes the new method of revenue recognition is preferable in that it better aligns reported net revenues and earnings with current economic trends in its business and the management of the company 
in addition  the company believes the new method improves comparability of its operating results and financial position with similar companies 
this change was made effective october   the first day of the company s fiscal year 
the million cumulative effect of this accounting change on prior years net of a tax benefit of million increased net loss for the year ended september  of the net loss per share for the year ended september   per share is attributable to the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
restructuring pursuant to a restructuring plan  the company decided to close stores and recorded a pretax charge of million million net of tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal the total pretax charge included million included in restructuring expense on the consolidated statement of operations for the write down to realizable value the closed stores property  equipment  pawn loans outstanding  intangible assets  and the estimated costs for the settlement of lease obligations  administrative costs  severance costs  and other exit costs 
also included in the total charge is approximately million included in restructuring expense on the consolidated statement of operations related to other restructuring charges  primarily severance for administrative staff reductions 
all charges for severance included in the restructuring related to employees notified of their position elimination prior to september  the million pretax charge included a million write down of inventory included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statement of operations for discounts expected in liquidating these stores remaining inventory 
of the stores  were closed as of june   resulting in employee terminations 
in june  the company re evaluated the seven remaining stores and decided to continue their operation  based on their improved operating performance and future outlook 
accordingly  the company reversed the million restructure accrual related to these seven stores 
the company recorded an additional million restructure expense for the store previously closed  primarily to account for lease obligations costing more than originally estimated  resulting in a net credit to restructuring expense of million in fiscal of the million net credit  million is for the anticipated administrative costs and loss from disposing of fixed and intangible assets and is recorded as a credit to the restructuring expense  where the charge was recorded in september the remaining million was originally charged to cost of goods sold to write these stores inventory down to liquidation value  and was credited to cost of goods sold in fiscal  as the company no longer expects to sell this inventory at liquidation prices 
the results of operations from the closed stores were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended september  total revenues   operating loss   at september   the company had a remaining restructuring reserve of million 
it is anticipated that all remaining material cash outlays required for these store closings and related restructuring costs will be made during fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s million fiscal cash flow from operations consisted of million of earnings before non cash depreciation and amortization  a million income tax refund  and the collection of a million note receivable  reduced by million restructuring expenditures and other changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased to million from million in fiscal excluding restructuring expenses of million and the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  the company s most significant item in reconciling net loss to cash flow from operations was a million decrease in inventory  compared to a million increase in inventory in the year earlier period 
in fiscal  the company invested million in property and equipment and million in funding the net increase in short term loans 
these investments and a million reduction in debt were funded by cash flow from operating activities of million  million in proceeds from the sale of assets  primarily the sale leaseback of owned properties  and million of cash on hand 
during fiscal  the company completed sales and sale leasebacks of certain non core assets and twenty owned properties in accordance with its restructuring plan 
during fiscal  the company plans to complete sale leasebacks of other owned properties 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations and proceeds from sale leasebacks will be adequate to fund planned capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and required debt payments during the coming year 
however  there can be no assurance that the sale of these assets will be completed or that cash flow from operating activities will be adequate for these expenditures 
effective december   the company amended and restated its credit agreement 
among other things  the amendment extends the maturity date to october  the amended credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility and a term loan of approximately million  which are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
availability under the revolving credit facility continues to be tied to loan and inventory balances 
the term facility must be paid in full by july  these term facility payments will be made from operating cash flow and the sale of assets  primarily sale leaseback transactions of owned properties 
interest on the revolving credit facility will accrue at the agent bank s prime rate prime plus basis points  but will be payable monthly at prime plus basis points 
the accrued but unpaid interest will be payable upon the earlier of the refinancing or maturity of the revolving credit facility 
interest on the term loan will accrue and be paid monthly at prime plus basis points 
the company pays a commitment fee of basis points on the unused amount of the revolving facility 
the company believes that the financial covenants established in the amended credit facility will be achieved based upon the company s current and anticipated performance 
based upon management s expected performance for fiscal  including the sale leaseback of certain assets and the availability under the revolving credit facility  the company believes that there is adequate liquidity to fund the company s operations and to make the required principal payments under the term loan during fiscal however  material shortfalls or variances from anticipated performance or the delay in the sale of certain of its assets could require the company to seek a further amendment to the amended credit facility or alternate sources of financing  or to limit capital expenditures to an amount less than that currently anticipated or permitted under the amended and restated credit facility 
seasonality historically  pawn service charge revenues are highest in the fourth fiscal quarter july  august and september due to higher loan demand during the summer months and merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season and tax refunds
