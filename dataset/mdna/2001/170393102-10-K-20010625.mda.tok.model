overview in the past fiscal year  we engaged in three business segments diagnostic products which develops  manufactures and markets our l d x r system the l d x system which performs near patient diagnostic tests that assist in assessing the risk of certain cholesterol related diseases  certain liver diseases  and in the monitoring of therapy to treat that diseases 
wellcheck which conducts consumer testing within the united states that assesses the risk of certain cholesterol related and other diseases and assists in the monitoring of therapy to treat those diseases 
wellcheck 
com which provides interactive tools to consumers through the internet to better assess the risk of certain cholesterol related and other diseases and to monitor and motivate personal health management of those diseases 
diagnostic products currently manufactures and markets the l d x system  including the l d x analyzer and a variety of single use test cassettes  in the united states and internationally 
the l d x system allows health care providers to perform individual tests or combinations of tests with a single drop of blood from a fingerstick within five minutes 
our current products measure and monitor blood cholesterol  related lipids  glucose and liver function  and are used to test patients at risk of or suffering from heart disease  diabetes or liver disease 
wellcheck currently provides cholesterol and related testing services and education to the general public using the l d x system and creates opportunities for sales of test cassettes manufactured by our diagnostic products business 
wellcheck s professionals provide high quality services and offer test event expertise to both event sponsors and consumers 
as part of our testing services  we utilize our proprietary teams technology which automates registration  data acquisition and information management at promotional  corporate wellness and other consumer testing events and provides consumers with a personalized risk assessment for heart disease 
substantially all of wellcheck s revenue is derived from promotional programs with major pharmaceutical companies marketing lipid lowering statin drugs 
we believe an opportunity exists to further expand our testing services business in the promotional  corporate wellness  retail markets and other convenient venues which broaden consumer access to testing while assisting consumer product companies  such as pharmaceutical companies  in customer acquisition 
our goal is to develop the first nationwide consumer testing services company for chronic diseases 
we launched wellcheck 
com operations in october to develop website content and teams technology to provide consumers with interactive tools to learn about and manage cholesterol related diseases 
based on our determination that adequate sponsor funding for a retail oriented  chronic disease management model roll out was unavailable at present  we refocused on expanding our activities in the promotional and corporate wellness market 
as a result  our wellcheck 
com business unit and its consumer oriented website have been repositioned as a technology support tool for our wellcheck business 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash  non recurring charge of million to reflect the impairment of certain intangible assets associated with the development of wellcheck 
com s website and database 
more recently we merged wellcheck 
com into wellcheck 
we intend to operate and manage wellcheck and wellcheck

the  provision for income taxes in fiscal represented the estimated federal and state alternative minimum taxes payable  reduced for the use of nols and tax credit carryforwards

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the wellcheck 
com segment  for a write off capitalized website and database development cost 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional legal and other charge of million in regards to resolving a class action lawsuit 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company  to date  has not engaged in derivative and hedging activities  and accordingly  does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the financial reporting and related disclosures of the company 
the company will adopt sfas no 
 as required by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of the fasb statement no 
 beginning with the first quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of  the financial accounting standards board issued an exposure draft related to business combinations 
if the final results are adopted as proposed  as of january   the company will no longer be required to amortize goodwill as a charge to earnings 
in addition  the company will be required to periodically review goodwill for potential impairment 
if an impairment is found to exist  a charge will be taken against earnings in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company cannot currently determine the amount of an impairment charge  if any  that would be recorded upon adoption 
factors affecting future operating results we have no prior experience in the testing services business  and if this new business is not successful  we will be greatly harmed 
the testing services business being pursued by our wellcheck business unit is completely new to us and our management team 
this will make it more difficult for us to successfully develop this new business 
also  we will be devoting significant resources to developing this new business 
if we are not successful in developing this new business  our diagnostic products business will be greatly harmed 
even if we are successful at developing the new business  the demands of attempting to grow this new business may prevent us from devoting significant time and attention to our traditional diagnostic products business  and that business may decline 
our operating results may suffer if we are unable to manage geographically diverse operations 
we have managed and operated our traditional business almost exclusively from our hayward  california headquarters 
our new wellcheck business requires us to operate in multiple geographically dispersed locations and adapt our management and financial systems and controls to this new geographically dispersed business 
if we cannot successfully manage our geographic expansion  the testing services business will not succeed and we will not recover our large investment in the testing services business 
as a result  our business would suffer 
our new testing services business requires significant management attention and financial resources to develop and if this new business is not successful  our business will suffer 
the continued development of our new testing services business will require significant management attention and financial resources 
these expenditures are likely to materially affect our operating results as a whole 
we may need to seek additional capital to help fund these start up expenses 
the required additional capital may not be available to us at favorable or acceptable terms when required  or at all 
if we cannot obtain required additional capital  we may have to change our business strategy  which would be disruptive to our business 
if we raise additional capital through borrowings  the terms of such borrowings may impose limitations on how our management may operate the business in the future 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity  this may result in a dilution of existing shareholders interests in us 
also  equity issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders 
if we fail to integrate any future acquisitions  our business will be harmed 
we may use acquisitions of existing testing services businesses as a significant part of the development of our new testing business 
these acquisitions could be very costly  could result in dilution to existing investors and could result in integration problems that harm the business as a whole 
any acquisition could result in expending significant amounts of cash  issuing potentially dilutive equity securities or incurring debt or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
any of these acquisition financing approaches could materially harm our operating results and business 
acquisitions may also result in difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products  services and personnel of the acquired company or business 
these difficulties could result in additional expenses and in diversion of management attention  which could prevent the new business from being successful 
any of these results could harm us financially 
our l d x system has not yet achieved broad market acceptance in all of our target markets and if broad market acceptance does not occur  our operating results will be harmed 
our l d x system  including the l d x analyzer our only product platform and single use test cassettes  will continue to account for substantially all of the revenue of our diagnostics products business for the foreseeable future 
if this revenue does not grow  our overall business will be severely harmed 
for us to increase revenue  sustain profitability and maintain positive cash flows from operations  the l d x system must gain much broader market acceptance among health care providers  particularly physician office laboratories and pharmacies 
we have made only limited sales to physician office laboratories and pharmacists to date relative to the size of the available markets 
factors that could prevent broad market acceptance of the l d x system include low levels of awareness of the availability of our technology in both the physician and other customer groups  the l d x system s accuracy  ease of use  rapid test time  reliability and cost effectiveness compared to other testing alternatives  the growing prevalence of managed care may adversely affect the physician office laboratory market  as a growing number of physicians are salaried employees and have no financial incentive to perform testing  many managed care organizations have contracts with laboratories  which require participating or employed physicians to send patient specimens to contracted laboratories  physicians are under growing pressure by medicare and other third party payors to limit their testing to medically necessary tests  and limited availability and amount of reimbursement for performing tests on the l d x system 
if we do not achieve broad market acceptance  our diagnostic products business will not grow 
even if we are successful in continuing to place l d x analyzers at physician office laboratories  pharmacies and other near patient testing sites  there can be no assurance that placement of l d x analyzers will result in sustained demand for our single use test cassettes 
we are relying in significant part on income from the core diagnostic product business to finance our strategic expansion 
if the diagnostic products business does not grow  the new business will not succeed 
these results will cause severe financial harm to us 
as a result of these many hurdles to achieving broad market acceptance for the l d x system  demand for the l d x system may not be sufficient to sustain revenue and profits from operations 
because the l d x system currently contributes the vast majority of our revenue  we could be required to cease operations if the l d x system does not achieve and maintain a significant level of market acceptance 
our business has experienced a history of operating losses and fluctuating operating results  which may cause our stock price to fall 
historically  we have experienced significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our first profitable quarter was the second quarter of fiscal  and our first profitable year was fiscal however  we recorded a net loss of million for fiscal our profitability and positive cash flows from operations in the future will require broadening market acceptance of our existing product offerings  successfully developing  introducing and marketing additional test cassettes or other products for our diagnostic products business  and successfully developing our new testing services business 
we may experience significant fluctuations in revenue and results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis in the future 
quarterly operating results will fluctuate due to numerous factors  including the timing and amount of expenditures required for the continued development of our new testing services business  the timing and level of market acceptance of the l d x system  the timing of the introduction and availability of new tests  the timing and level of expenditures associated with research and development activities  the timing and level of expenditures associated with expansion of sales and marketing activities and overall operations  our ability to reduce the cost of cassette manufacturing  variations in manufacturing efficiencies  the timing and establishment of strategic distribution arrangements and the success of the activities conducted under such arrangements  changes in demand for our products based on changes in third party reimbursement  competition  changes in government regulation and other factors  the timing of significant orders from  and shipments  to customers  product pricing and discounts  variations in the mix of products sold  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly demand for our products may cause our manufacturing operations to fluctuate in volume  increase uncertainty in operational planning and or affect cash flows from operations 
many of our expenses are made in advance  based on our expectations of future business needs 
these costs are largely fixed in the short term 
as a result  when business levels do not meet expectations  our fixed costs will not be recovered and we will experience losses 
this situation is likely to result in the future because of the variability and unpredictability of our revenue 
this also means that our results will likely not meet the expectations of public market security analysts or investors at one time or another  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly 
if we do not successfully develop  introduce and market new tests  our business will be harmed 
most of our revenue comes from our diagnostics products business 
we anticipate this will continue for the near term 
we also rely on revenue from the diagnostics products business to fund the development of our new testing services business 
we believe our diagnostic products business will not grow significantly if we do not develop new tests to use with the l d x system 
if new tests are not developed and accepted in the market  our business will not grow significantly and will be harmed 
developing new tests involves many significant problems and risks  including research and development is a very expensive process  research and development takes a very long time to result in a marketable product  significant costs including diversion of resources may be incurred in development before knowing if the development will result in a test that is commercially viable  a new test will not be successful unless it is effectively marketed to its target market  the manufacturing process for a new test must be reliable  cost efficient  and high volume and must be developed and implemented in a timely manner to produce the test for sale  new tests must meet a significant market need to be successful  and new tests must obtain proper regulatory approvals to be marketed 
we could experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new tests 
for example  regulatory clearance or approval of any new tests may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
we have experienced difficulties obtaining regulatory approval for tests in the past 
because the fda s evaluation of applications for clia waived status is not based on precisely defined  objectively measurable criteria  we cannot predict the likelihood of obtaining waived status for future products 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes 
we internally manufacture all of the single use test cassettes that are used with the l d x analyzer 
the manufacture of single use test cassettes is a highly complex and precise process that is sensitive to a wide variety of factors 
we have  in the past  experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields that have adversely affected gross margins and delayed product shipments 
if we do not maintain acceptable manufacturing yields of test cassettes or experience product shipment delays  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of test cassettes because of raw materials variations or impurities  manufacturing process variances and impurities  and decreased manufacturing equipment performance 
our cassette manufacturing lines would be costly and time consuming to repair or replace if their operation were interrupted 
the interruption of our manufacturing operations or the loss of employees dedicated to the manufacturing facility could severely harm our business 
the risks involving our manufacturing lines include as our production levels have increased  we have been required to use our machinery more hours per day and the down time resulting from equipment failure has increased  the custom nature of much of our manufacturing equipment increases the time required to remedy equipment failures and replace equipment  we have a limited number of employees dedicated to the operation and maintenance of our manufacturing equipment  the loss of whom could impact our ability to effectively operate and service such equipment  and we manufacture all cassettes at our hayward  california manufacturing facility  so manufacturing operations are at risk to interruption from earthquake  fire  power outages or other events affecting this one location 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california s current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage ie when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently have backup generators to maintain only a limited amount of power and no alternate sources of power in the event of a prolonged blackout 
our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
our operating results may suffer if we do not reduce our manufacturing costs 
we believe we will be required to reduce manufacturing costs for new and existing test cassettes to achieve sustained profitability 
we currently operate two manufacturing lines for dry chemistry cassettes 
we are installing and validating a third manufacturing line that is currently in preproduction validation and should be fully operational in july the complexity and custom nature of our manufacturing process increases the amount of time and money required to add an additional manufacturing line 
despite our efforts  the new manufacturing line may not be completed in a timely fashion  or at all 
also  we may need to implement additional cassette manufacturing cost reduction programs 
failure to implement the new dry chemistry manufacturing line could prevent us from satisfying customer orders in a timely manner  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business 
failure to implement the new line could also prevent us from reducing manufacturing costs for dry chemistry tests  and prevent us from achieving sustained profitability 
our operating results may suffer if we do not develop new manufacturing processes and a new manufacturing line to market immunoassay tests in development 
we may be required to build a new cassette manufacturing line to manufacture the immunoassay test cassettes under development 
to date  we have not developed the processes and production equipment necessary for an immunoassay cassette manufacturing line 
if we fail to successfully develop an immunoassay cassette manufacturing line and achieve acceptable yields we may not be able to cost effectively satisfy customer orders 
this development would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on single source suppliers for inputs to our manufacturing process and failure of our suppliers to provide supplies to us could harm our business 
we currently depend on single source vendors to provide subassemblies  components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
any supply interruption in a single source subassembly  component or raw material could restrict our ability to manufacture products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified 
we may not be successful in qualifying additional sources of supply on a timely basis  or at all 
failure to obtain a usable alternative source could prevent us from manufacturing our products  resulting in inability to fill orders  customer dissatisfaction and loss of business 
this would likely severely harm our business 
in addition  an uncorrected impurity or supplier s variation in a raw material  either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process  could interfere with our ability to manufacture products 
because we are a small customer of many of our suppliers and we purchase their subassemblies  components and materials with purchase orders instead of long term commitments  our suppliers may not devote adequate resources to supplying our needs 
any interruption or reduction in the future supply of any subassemblies  components or raw materials currently obtained from single or limited sources could severely harm our business 
if we are successful in growing sales  our business will be harmed if we cannot effectively manage the operational and management challenges of growth 
if we are successful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance for the l d x system  we will be required to expand our operations  particularly in the areas of sales  marketing and manufacturing 
as we expand our operations  this expansion will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on our management  operating and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate any such growth and compete effectively  we will be required to implement and improve our information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to implement and improve operational  financial and management systems or to manage our work force as required by future growth  if any  could harm our business and prevent us from improving our financial condition as a result of increased sales 
we depend on distributors to sell our products  and have had difficulty in the past maintaining some distributor relationships 
to increase revenue and achieve sustained profitability  we will have to maintain and expand our existing distribution relationships and develop new distribution relationships 
we are dependent on such distributors to assist us in promoting market acceptance of the l d x system 
if we do not maintain and expand these relationships  our sales will not grow and our business will be greatly harmed 
we have in the past had problems maintaining relationships with our distributors to the pharmacy market 
distribution agreements with amerisource health corporation and bergen brunswig corporation  both national distributors to the pharmacy market  were cancelled due to contractual performance issues 
also  we may not be able to enter into and maintain new arrangements on a timely basis  or at all 
even if we do enter into additional distributor relationships  those distributors may not devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products 
we do not have the ability to prevent distributors from distributing products that compete with our products 
the distributors may also give higher priority to the products of our competitors 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial part of our revenue 
sales to a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period 
we have experienced periods in which sales to some of our major customers  as a percentage of total revenue  have fluctuated due to delays or failures to place expected orders 
we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future periods 
in fiscal  physician sales and service  inc accounted for approximately of our total revenue and gmr accounted for less than of our total revenue 
in fiscal  physician sales and service  inc accounted for approximately of our total revenue and gmr accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers 
customers generally purchase our products pursuant to cancelable short term purchase orders 
our results of operations have been negatively affected in the past by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by delays in or cancellations of orders 
if we were to lose a major customer or if orders by or shipments to a major customer were to otherwise decrease or be delayed  our results of operations would be harmed 
if third party reimbursement for use of our products is eliminated or reduced  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail 
in the united states  healthcare providers that purchase products such as the l d x system generally rely on third party payors  including private health insurance plans  federal medicare  state medicaid and managed care organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the product is being used 
we will not be able to successfully market our products if their purchase and use is not subject to reimbursement from government health authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
if this reimbursement is not available or is limited  healthcare providers will be much less likely to use our products  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business will likely fail 
there are current conditions in the healthcare industry that increase the possibility that third party payors may reduce or eliminate reimbursement for tests using our products in certain settings 
these conditions include third party payors increasingly scrutinize and challenge the prices charged for medical products and services  healthcare providers are moving toward a managed care system in which they provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per patient and authorize fewer elective procedures  such as uses of our products for diagnostic screening  general uncertainty regarding what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party payors and how that will affect use of products such as ours  which may deter healthcare providers from adopting the use of our products  and an overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both domestic and international  to reduce the cost of products and services  including products offered by us 
market acceptance of our products in international markets is also dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare systems 
reimbursement and healthcare systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the united states or international markets  and current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future 
also  future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may adversely affect demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
any of these events could materially harm our business 
see business third party reimbursement 
if the healthcare system in the united states undergoes fundamental change  these changes may harm our business 
we believe the healthcare industry in the united states is likely to undergo fundamental changes due to current political  economic and regulatory influences 
we anticipate that congress  state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems 
potential alternatives include mandated basic healthcare benefits  controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and medicare and medicaid spending  the creation of large insurance purchasing groups  price controls and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system 
we expect legislative debate to continue in the future and for market forces to demand reduced costs 
we cannot predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state health care reform measures  future private sector reform or market forces may have on our business 
any changes in the healthcare system could potentially have extremely negative effects on our business 
our products are subject to multiple levels of government regulation and any regulatory changes are difficult to predict and could be damaging to our business 
the manufacture and sale of our diagnostic products  including the l d x system  are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
we are not able to commence marketing or commercial sales in the united states of any of the new tests we develop until we receive required clearances and approvals 
the process of obtaining required regulatory clearances and approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
as a result  our new tests under development  even if successfully developed  may never obtain such clearance or approval 
additionally  certain material changes to products that have already been cleared or approved are subject to further review and clearance or approval 
medical devices are subject to continual review  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a cleared product may result in restrictions on the product s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we lose previously obtained clearances  or fail to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements  we may not be able to market the affected products  which would depress our revenue and severely harm our business 
in addition  any future amendment of or addition to regulations impacting our products could prevent us from marketing the l d x system 
regulatory changes could hurt our business by increasing burdens on our products or by reducing or eliminating certain competitive advantages of the l d x system s waived status 
food and drug administration clearance or approval of products such as ours can be obtained by either of two processes the k clearance process  which generally takes from four to twelve months but may take longer  and the pre market approval process  which is a longer and more costly process than a k clearance process  involves the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information and generally takes one to three years but may take significantly longer 
if our future products are required to obtain a pre market approval  this would significantly delay our ability to market those tests and significantly increase the costs of development 
the use of our products and those of our competitors is also affected by federal and state regulations  which provide for regulation of laboratory testing  as well as by the laws and regulations of foreign countries 
the scope of these regulations includes quality control  proficiency testing  personnel standards and inspections 
in the united states  clinical laboratory testing is regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement act of the l d x analyzer  our total cholesterol  high density lipoproteins  triglycerides and glucose tests in any combination and our alt test cassette have been classified as waived from the application of many of the requirements under the clinical laboratory improvement act 
we believe this waived classification is critical for our products to be successful in their markets 
any failure of our new tests to obtain waived status under the clinical laboratory improvement act will severely limit our ability to commercialize such tests 
loss of waived status for existing diagnostic products or failure to obtain waived status for new products could limit our sales and revenue  which would severely harm our business 
we may face fines or our manufacturing facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations 
our manufacturing processes and  in certain instances  those of our contract manufacturers  are subject to stringent federal  state and local regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in many things  including warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
any of these could harm our business 
we and our contract manufacturers are also subject to federal  state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture of healthcare products and diagnostic devices  including quality system regulations  which requires the maintenance of a quality system consistent with fda regulations  iso en requirements  which is an industry standard for maintaining and assuring conformance to quality standards  and other foreign regulations and state and local health  safety and environmental regulations  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products or require us to incur significant costs to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations  which could harm our business 
our business depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology through patents and other means  which may not be successful or may require costly litigation to enforce 
our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we have nine united states patents and have filed patent applications relating to our technology internationally under the patent cooperation treaty and individual foreign patent applications 
the risks of relying on the proprietary nature of our technology include our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  or  if issued  such patents may not offer protection against competitors with similar technology  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future  and the rights created under our patents may not provide a competitive advantage  competitors  many of which have substantially greater resources than us and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents covering technologies that are more effective than ours 
this could render our technologies or products obsolete or uncompetitive or could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets  the medical products industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings conducted in the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions 
litigation may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming and will likely result in substantial diversion of attention of technical and management personnel 
in the past  patent infringement claims have been asserted against us 
in december  an injunction was filed in zug  switzerland by roche diagnostics  a subsidiary of roche holdings  ltd  seeking a cease and desist order barring us and two of our distributors from distributing hdl assay single use test cassettes in switzerland 
the complaint alleges that we violated a roche european patent for hdl 
the court is expected to reach a decision on the merits of the complaint in the next several months 
additionally  in january  a complaint was filed in the district court  dusseldorf  germany against us and two of our distributors seeking a cease and desist order barring the distributors from shipping hdl single use test cassettes into germany 
the complaint alleges we and our distributors violated a roche german priority patent for hdl by selling our single use test cassette containing a hdl assay 
the court has requested additional information be submitted by both parties  but has not made any ruling or set additional court dates 
in september  we were served a complaint  no 
ei ti roch  filed in vienna  austria by roche diagnostics  seeking a cease and desist order barring us and one of our distributors from distributing hdl assay single use test cassettes in austria 
the complaint alleges that we violated a roche european patent for hdl 
at this point  no schedule has been set regarding court activity 
we believe all suits are without merit and intend to defend the cases vigorously 
we do not believe that we engaged in any wrongdoing and that the outcome of this matter will not result in a material adverse effect  however  there can be no assurance that the lawsuits will be resolved in our favor 
we rely on trade secrets  technical know how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
we may also not be able to meaningfully protect our right to our trade secrets 
we depend on technology that we license from others  which may not be available to us in the future and would prevent us from producing our products and severely harm our business 
our current products incorporate technologies which are the subject of patents issued to  and patent applications filed by  others 
we have obtained licenses for certain of these technologies 
we may in the future be required to obtain licenses for new products 
we may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also may not be able to develop alternative approaches if we are unable to obtain licenses 
also  our current and future licenses may not be adequate for the operation of our business 
failure to obtain adequate licenses on commercially reasonable terms could prevent us from producing our products and severely harm our business 
we may not be able to effectively compete against other providers of diagnostic products and testing services  which could cause our sales to decline 
the markets for diagnostic products and testing services in which we operate are intensely competitive 
our competition consists mainly of clinical and hospital laboratories  as well as manufacturers of bench top analyzers 
to achieve market acceptance for the l d x system  we must demonstrate that the l d x system is an attractive alternative to bench top analyzers as well as to clinical and hospital laboratories 
this will require physicians to change their established means of having such tests performed 
the l d x system may not be able to compete with these other testing services and analyzers 
in addition  companies having a significant presence in the market for therapeutic monitoring  such as abbott laboratories  beckman coulter  inc and roche diagnostics  a subsidiary of roche holding  ltd 
have developed or are developing analyzers designed for near patient testing 
these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than us 
these competitors also offer broader product lines than us  have greater name recognition than us and offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
in addition  several smaller companies are currently making or developing products that compete or will compete with ours 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
even if we do have such resources and capabilities  we may not employ them successfully 
failure to retain our key personnel and attract additional qualified employees could hurt our operations 
our success depends in significant part on the continued service of certain key scientific  technical  regulatory and managerial personnel 
our success will also require us to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in those areas 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are located  because of the number of attractive technology employment opportunities and the extremely high cost of living 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel or attract or retain other necessary highly qualified personnel in the future 
if we do not keep our key personnel or attract other needed employees  we will not be able to grow our business 
sale of our diagnostic products and performance of our services may subject us to liability claims  and if our insurance is insufficient  this liability could severely harm our business 
sale of our products and performance of our testing services entail risk of product and professional claims 
if any of these claims are brought  we may have to expend significant resources defending against them 
if we are found liable for any of these claims  we may have to pay damages that could severely hurt our financial position 
loss of these claims could also hurt our reputation  resulting in our losing business and market share 
the medical testing industry has historically been litigious  and we face financial exposure to these liability claims if use of our products results in personal injury or improper diagnosis 
we also face the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall 
we currently maintain product liability professional liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate 
insurance is expensive and difficult to obtain  and product liability insurance may not be able to be maintained in the future on acceptable terms  in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability 
inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability could prevent or inhibit the continued commercialization of our products 
in addition  a product liability claim in excess of relevant insurance coverage or a product recall could severely hurt our financial condition 
we may need additional capital in the future to support our growth  and such additional funds may not be available to us 
we intend to expend substantial funds for capital expenditures related to expansion of our manufacturing capacity  research and development  expansion of sales and marketing activities and other working capital and general corporate purposes 
also  we plan to expend significant amounts in developing our new testing services business 
although we believe our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow anticipated to be generated by future operations and available bank borrowings under an existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future  we may still require additional financing 
for example  we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in expanding manufacturing capacity for existing cassettes or in the course of completing required additional development  obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  obtaining waived status under clia or introducing or scaling up manufacturing for new tests 
developing our new testing services business may also require more capital than we currently anticipate 
this possibility is increased given our lack of experience in the markets addressed by this new business 
if additional financing is needed  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could prevent us from developing our products and our business 
we have made use of devices to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our poison pill anti takeover plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the poison pill may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the poison pill may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the poison pill 
our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors 
the market price of our stock has in the past been  and is likely in the future to continue to be  highly volatile 
these fluctuations could result in substantial losses for investors 
factors that cause our stock price to fluctuate include quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements by us and our competitors of technological innovations or new commercial products  government regulation  changes in the current structure of the healthcare financing and payment systems  developments in or disputes regarding patent or other proprietary rights  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for medical products and high technology companies and which are often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies  and general economic  political and market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action suits have been filed against the issuing company 
this type of litigation has been brought against us in the past and could be brought against us in the future  which would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
any adverse determination in such litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
if third party sponsorship of our testing services business is eliminated or reduced  our revenue will be greatly reduced and our business may fail 
wellcheck derives the majority of its revenue from third parties using our testing services to promote their products 
if the third parties decline to participate in the future or the amount of sponsorship is reduced  consumers will be much less likely to use our testing services and our revenue will be greatly reduced and our business will likely fail 
our wellcheck segment has a contract with gmr which is in effect until january  but can be cancelled with a thirty day notice 
we must locate an adequate number of testing venues for the testing services business 
for our testing services business to succeed  we must maintain the current number of testing sites and find a greater number of locations and more diverse venues to perform consumer testing 
we must convince operators of the venues of the testing services economic benefits 
if the number of testing sites do not increase or are reduced  our business could be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures our exposure to market risks is inherent in our operations  primarily to interest rates relating to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  we are subject to interest rate risks on cash  cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
we have concluded that the fair market value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates due to the nature of our marketable securities  which do not exceed fiscal and have primarily fixed interest rates 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments 
total fair value in thousands cash  cash equivalents    short term marketable securities    weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities    weighted average interest rate qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to the available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to a significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio
