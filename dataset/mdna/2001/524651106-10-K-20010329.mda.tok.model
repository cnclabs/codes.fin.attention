results of operations revenue 
revenue is derived from primarily two sources i product license revenue  derived from the sale of product licenses to resellers and end users  including large scale enterprises  and royalty revenue  derived from initial license fees and ongoing royalties from product licenses of source code to oems  and ii service and support revenue  derived from providing software updates  support and education and consulting services to end users 
product license revenue is generally recognized when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection of resulting receivables is probable 
for sales to domestic distributors  product license revenue is recognized upon sale by the distributor to the end user  since these distributors generally have unlimited rights of return  and we historically have not been able to make reasonable estimates of product returns for these distributors 
we also incur additional internal costs to assist our distributors in selling our products to end users 
for sales to certain value added resellers in the fiscal years ended december  and  product license revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash from these value added resellers since the arrangements with these resellers may include extended payment terms  which in some cases  are contingent upon them receiving payment from their end user customer 
estimated product returns are recorded upon recognition of revenue from customers having rights of return  including exchange rights for unsold products and product upgrades 
provisions for estimated warranty costs and anticipated retroactive price adjustments are recorded at the time products are shipped 
product license revenue from royalty payments is recognized upon receipt of royalty reports from oems related to their product sales 
revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
service and support revenue consists primarily of revenue received for providing maintenance ie  software updates and technical support  on site support  consulting and training 
revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
revenue allocated to education and consulting services  or derived from the separate sales of these services  is recognized as the related services are provided 
when contracts contain multiple obligations eg products  updates  technical support and other services wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  the company accounts for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by statement of position any revenue related to updates or technical support in these arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
change in millions product license service and support total revenue sources of revenue as a percent of total revenue 
product license service and support product license revenue decreased for  when compared to  primarily due to the implementation of our new software subscription licensing model during the second quarter of and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in sales volume of our software products resulting from the headcount turnover within the sales force 
the increase in product license for  when compared to  is primarily as a result of the continued acceptance of our networker family of products  particularly to large scale enterprises  as well as increased royalty revenue 
the increase of sales and marketing personnel as well as sales and marketing programs helped to increase the market acceptance of our products and product sales 
service and support revenue increased for  when compared to  primarily as a result of increased maintenance renewals over a larger installed base and  to a lesser extent  growth in our consulting and education services 
the increase in service and support revenue for  when compared to  is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of registered customers electing to subscribe to support contracts and to renew software support contracts after the initial one year term 
our increase in internal staffing for software support helped to increase new sales and renewals of our software support contracts 
we expect that service and support will increase in absolute dollars in  but at a growth rate less than in revenue by geography 
change in millions domestic international total revenue revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 
domestic international domestic revenue decreased for  when compared to  primarily due to a decrease in sales volume of our products given the turnover in the headcount of the domestic sales force and the implementation of our new software subscription licensing model during the second quarter of international revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued market acceptance of our products overseas as we continue to invest in international sales offices and to sign international distributors and resellers 
the majority of international sales during these periods were made in europe and canada 
we intend to grow sales by increasing productivity of the domestic sales force and further expanding our international operations 
in order to successfully expand international sales  we must continue to establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel for these operations and recruit additional international resellers 
cost of revenue 
change in millions product license service and support cost of revenue as a percent of related revenue 
product license service and support cost of product license revenue includes costs of production personnel  packaging and documentation  freight and royalties 
product gross margin remained constant at in  when compared in product gross margin increased to in  when compared to in  primarily due to the phase out of reselling third party products through qualix direct telesales organization prior to our acquisition in april cost of service and support revenue includes costs associated with providing customers with services  such as consulting and education  telephonic and on site support and product updates 
costs include primarily salaries and costs to recruit  develop and retain personnel  packaging  documentation and delivery of product updates and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization 
cost of service and support revenue increased million in  when compared to  and was driven by increases in the support function and expansion of our consulting and education services 
service and support headcount increased to in from in cost of service and support revenue increased million in  when compared to  primarily due to supporting a larger installed base of products as well as providing higher support levels to customers 
service and support headcount increased to in from in service and support gross margin decreased to in  when compared to in and in  primarily due to the increased staffing to support as discussed above and outsourcing certain of our consulting arrangements 
total gross profit was million in  million in and million in  representing gross margin of in  in and in the decrease in total gross margin for  when compared to  relates primarily to the decrease in service and support gross margin during operating expenses 
change in millions sales and marketing research and development general and administrative operating expenses as a percent of total revenue 
sales and marketing research and development general and administrative sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as salaries  benefits  commissions and promotional and advertising expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to increased recruiting costs  air travel and facilities expenses and  to a lesser extent  an increase in our headcount to employees in from employees in the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million in  when compared to  was primarily attributable to an increase in employee related expenses resulting from increased headcount to from in and as a result of additional marketing and promotional activities to increase awareness of our products 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of total revenue  as we continue to moderately expand our sales and marketing staff 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as salaries  benefits and facilities and equipment costs 
the increase in research and development expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits as headcount ramped significantly in as a result of our acquisitions of intelliguard in april and vinca in july under purchase accounting  the results of operations of these companies were added to our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
accordingly  we have a full year of salary and benefits costs in the increase in research and development expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to the increased staffing and associated support for engineers necessary to expand and enhance our product line 
the number of research and development personnel increased from in to employees in and decreased to employees in we believe that research and development expenses will continue to increase slightly in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of total revenue  as we continue to invest in developing new products and enhancing existing products 
general and administrative expenses primarily include employee related costs of our finance  human resources  facilities  information systems and other administrative departments 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and other compensation  recruiting costs  legal and other professional services and bad debt expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to increased staffing and related costs required to manage and support our expansion 
general and administrative personnel increased from employees in to employees in and decreased to employees in we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of revenue  as we make certain investments in infrastructure in the first half of and continue to expand our operations internationally 
amortization of intangibles was million in  million in and million in during  we recorded additional intangibles related to the acquisitions of intelliguard totaling million and vinca totaling million 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are amortizing these intangibles on a straight line basis over periods ranging from seventeen months to five years from the dates of acquisition 
we expect to amortize intangibles of million in  million in  million in and million in we incurred acquisition related expenses of million related to fulltime in and million related to software moguls in such expenses consisted primarily of investment banking  accounting and other professional fees and costs relating to the closure of duplicative facilities and severance costs 
in addition  we incurred professional fees of million in connection with our proposed acquisition of ontrack data international  inc during the fourth quarter of in january  we entered into a mutual termination agreement with ontrack to immediately terminate the proposed acquisition 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our acquisitions of intelliguard during the second quarter of and vinca during the third quarter of  we purchased in process research and development of million and million  respectively 
during and  we did not acquire any purchased in process research and development projects 
the fair value of intelliguard s and vinca s core technologies  existing products  as well as the technology currently under development were determined by independent appraisers using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward by a premium of for the in process projects from the intelliguard acquisition and to for the in process projects from vinca acquisition to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
we expect that the pricing models related to these acquisitions will be considered standard within the high technology industry 
however  we have not and do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
the intelliguard projects included in in process research and development and the percent complete  the estimated cost to complete and the value assigned to each project follows in thousands estimate percent estimated cost value project completion to complete assigned a b  c the vinca projects included in in process research and development and the percent complete  the estimated cost to complete and the value assigned to each project as follows in thousands estimate percent estimated cost value project completion to complete assigned a b c  d  e  f  g  h  i  continued development of these technologies remains a significant risk to legato due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time of the acquisition and potentially result in impairment of any other assets related to the development activities 
interest income  net 
interest income  net was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest income  net relates primarily to an increase in interest rates for  when compared to  and interest earned from the increased cash balances for  when compared to provision for benefit from income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes was million in as compared to a provision for income taxes of million in and million in  with an effective tax rate of in  in and in the difference in the effective tax rate for  when compared to  is primarily attributable to our net loss in versus net income in and the effect of non deductible amortization and foreign tax expense related to foreign income 
the increase in the effective tax rate for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to the impact of non deductible merger and amortization expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions of fulltime  intelliguard and vinca during liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million as of december  as compared to million as of december  as of december   we had working capital of million  no long term debt and stockholders equity of million 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily by cash from operations and sales of our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of increases to accrued liabilities and deferred revenue of million  depreciation and amortization of million  the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million and a provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million partially offset by the net loss of million and increases in deferred tax assets of million and other assets of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net income of million plus the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  depreciation and amortization of million  the write off of purchased in process research and development costs of million  a provision for doubtful accounts and returns reserve of million offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities of million and by million attributable to the change in deferred taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net income of million plus the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  depreciation and amortization of million and the change in operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by million attributable to the change in deferred taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in purchases of property and equipment increased to million in from million in and from million in as a result of supporting the growth in our operations as well as investing in information technology infrastructure 
in  investing activities also consisted of net payments of million for the purchases of intelliguard and vinca as well as a million investment in a private company 
in  the net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected the purchase of property and equipment partially offset by a decrease in our net cash investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock 
during  we also received million in connection with the sale of one qualifying accounts receivable on a non recourse basis 
however  subsequent to year end  the agreement and related receivable was cancelled 
as a result  the proceeds received have been presented as a financing activity rather than cash from operating activities 
the short term loan was repaid in based on our current operating plan  we believe our current cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
while we are exposed with respect to interest rate fluctuations in many countries  our interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in the us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
we invest in high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
cash equivalents are highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less as of the date of purchase 
investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
as of december   the carrying value approximated fair value 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our investments in marketable securities as of december  dollars in millions 
carrying interest value rate investment securities short term investments fixed rate long term investments fixed rate total investment securities cash equivalents variable rate foreign currency risk 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could seriously harm our financial results 
substantially all of our international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore  reduce the demand for our products 
reduced demand for our products could seriously harm our financial results 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the application of opinion for a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  the impact of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance for revenue recognition under certain circumstances 
the accounting and disclosures prescribed by sab were effective for the year ended december  and did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations
