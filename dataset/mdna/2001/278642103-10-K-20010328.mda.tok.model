when used in this document  the words expects  anticipates  intends and plans and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements made in this document should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this document 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this document 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below 
overview we pioneered online person to person trading by developing a global online trading platform that will help practically anyone buy or sell practically anything 
our service permits sellers to list items for sale  buyers to bid on items of interest and all ebay users to browse through listed items in a fully automated  topically arranged  intuitive and easy to use online service that is available hours a day  seven days a week 
we have extended our online offerings to include regional and international trading  autos  premium priced items  and through our acquisition of half 
com and our recently introduced buy it now feature  we now offer fixed price functionality 
additionally  billpoint provides online billing and payment solutions 
we also expanded into the traditional auction business  also called offline trading  with our acquisitions of butterfields and kruse 
substantially all of our revenues come from fees and commissions associated with online and offline trading services 
online revenue is primarily derived from placement fees  success fees  commissions paid by sellers  and commissions paid by buyers for premium priced items 
sellers pay a nominal placement fee  and by paying additional fees  sellers can have items featured in various ways 
sellers also pay a success fee based on the final purchase price 
in addition  we receive revenues from end to end service providers whose services increase the velocity of transactions to the site  revenues from commercial alliances designed to build out a category or other functions and from direct advertising which includes promotional payments from unrelated third parties 
although we expect these end to end  commercial alliance and direct advertising revenues to increase in the future  they are subject to considerable uncertainty 
see risk factors our revenue from end to end service providers  commercial alliances and advertising is subject to factors beyond our control 
to date  online payment solutions provided by billpoint and fixed price trading provided by half 
com have not made significant contributions to net revenues  although we expect billpoint s and half 
com s revenues to increase in the future 
offline revenue is derived from a variety of sources including sellers commissions  buyers premiums  bidder registration fees  and auction related services including appraisal and authentication 
we expect that the online business will continue to represent the majority of revenue growth in the foreseeable future 
acquisitions half 
com on july   we acquired half 
com 
half 
com provides a fixed price  person to person e commerce site allowing people to buy and sell previously owned goods at discounted prices 
in connection with the merger  we issued  or reserved for issuance  a total of approximately  shares of our common stock to half 
com s existing shareholders  option holders and warrant holders 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
internet auction on february   we acquired a majority interest in internet auction co  ltd  a south korean company internet auction 
internet auction introduced person to person trading in korea when it launched in april internet auction is listed on the kosdaq and is expected to continue to trade on kosdaq 
we acquired  of the outstanding shares of internet auction  slightly more than  at a fixed price of  korean won per share or approximately million in the aggregate 
the transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the purchase price will be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
ibazar sa on february   we signed a binding agreement to acquire ibazar sa ibazar 
ibazar is based in paris and introduced online  person to person trading in france when it launched in october currently  ibazar has websites in belgium  brazil  france  italy  the netherlands  portugal  spain  and sweden 
as consideration for of the outstanding shares of ibazar  we will issue approximately  shares of our common stock  subject to a minimum valuation of approximately million and a maximum valuation of approximately million  based on the value of our stock at closing 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase business combination and is subject to various regulatory approvals 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net revenues 
the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative payroll expense on employee stock options amortization of acquired intangibles merger related costs total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net interest expense income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in consolidated companies net income it is difficult for us to forecast revenues or earnings accurately  and the operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
although accurate revenue forecasts are difficult  we have begun to recognize the seasonal nature of our business because many of our users reduce their activities on our website during the thanksgiving and christmas holidays and with the onset of good weather 
we have historically experienced our strongest quarter of online growth in our first fiscal quarter  although our shift to more practical items may cause our seasonal patterns to look more like a typical retailer 
both butterfields and kruse have significant quarter to quarter variations in their results of operations depending on the timing of auctions and the availability of high quality items from large collections and estates 
butterfields typically has its best operating results in the traditional fall and spring auction seasons and has historically incurred operating losses in the first and third quarters 
kruse typically sees a seasonal peak in operations in the third quarter 
seasonal or cyclical variations in our business may become more pronounced over time and may harm our results of operations in the future 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting net revenues  it is also difficult to forecast income statement expense categories as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expense categories as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
as a general note  we expect costs to increase in absolute dollars across all income statement categories 
to a large extent  the changes in the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented are due to the growth of the online business  which will be the primary focus of our year over year comparisons 
net revenues we derive revenue from a variety of sources including listing  success and featured item fees  end to end services  commercial alliances  sponsorships and other advertising 
in addition  we derive commissions and rental income from our traditional offline auction operations 
our net revenues increased from million to million for the years ended december  and and further increased to million in the year ended december  the successive year over year growth from through was predominantly the result of increased use of our website  reflected in the growth in the number of registered users  listings and gross merchandise sales 
we expect that future revenue growth will be largely driven by the growth of online services including end to end services  commercial alliance revenues and direct advertising 
the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
as it relates to ebay  sab requires that listing and featured item fee revenue be recognized ratably over the estimated period of the auction 
we implemented sab in the first quarter of  and the effect was insignificant 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues for online operations consists primarily of costs associated with customer support and site operations 
the costs included are compensation  employee and facilities costs for customer support and site operations personnel  isp connectivity charges and depreciation on site equipment 
cost of net revenues in traditional auction operations primarily includes compensation for auction  appraisal  and customer support personnel and direct auction costs  such as event site rental 
cost of net revenues increased from million or of net revenues to million or of net revenues for the years ended december  and and further increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of sales to million or of net revenues in the year ended december  the successive year over year growth from through was due almost entirely to our online business  including our international operations  as well as our acquisition of billpoint in and half 
com in the increase in absolute dollars in expenditures for the online service resulted from the continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations departments  depreciation of the equipment required for site operations  software licensing fees and isp connectivity charges 
the decrease in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenue from to resulted from cost management in customer support and site operations and increases in higher gross margin businesses such as autos and end to end trading solutions 
as a result of these efficiencies  we expect the cost of net revenues to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net revenues in sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses for both the online and traditional auction businesses are comprised primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  advertising  tradeshow and other promotional costs  employee and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million or of net revenues to million or of net revenues for the years ended december  and and further increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of sales to million or of net revenues in the year ended december  the successive year over year growth from through was primarily the result of growth in online and traditional advertising  including expenses for various marketing agreements  personnel related costs  costs associated with the use of outside services and consultants and miscellaneous user and promotional costs 
online sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars for as we plan to build the ebay brand more broadly 
we expect to build our brand further with continued advertising impressions delivered under the strategic alliances with america online aol  autotrader 
com and go 
com a wholly owned subsidiary of the walt disney company an increase in mass media advertising and the expansion of international advertising 
sales and marketing expenses in the traditional auction businesses are expected to remain comparable with historical levels 
product development product development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our product development staff  payments to outside contractors  depreciation on equipment used for development  employee and facilities costs 
our product development expenses increased from million or of net revenues to million or of net revenues for the years ended december  and and further increased to million or of net revenues in the year ended december  the successive year over year growth from through was primarily the result of an increase in personnel related costs as we significantly increased the size of our product development staff  expenses related to contractors and consultants employed within product development departments  and maintenance and depreciation for equipment used in research and development 
the year over year increase also resulted from the addition of product development operations at billpoint in and half 
com in including a one time  stock based compensation expense at half 
com resulting from the acquisition 
product development expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars during future periods primarily from personnel additions  the continued impact of billpoint and half 
com product development  additional depreciation costs as we continue to purchase equipment to improve and expand operations both domestically and internationally and expected amortization costs associated with the phased rollout of our next generation three tier architecture 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel and  to a lesser extent  fees for external professional advisors  provisions for doubtful accounts  employee and facilities costs 
our general and administrative expenses increased from million or of net revenues to million or of net revenues for the years ended december  and and increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of sales to million or of net revenues in the year ended december  the year over year increases resulted from growth in personnel related expenses in order to meet the demands of our expanding business  including operations in new countries and the integration of new businesses  fees for professional services  employee and facilities costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in the infrastructure that is necessary for our business 
payroll expense on employee stock options we are subject to employer payroll taxes on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these employer payroll taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised and sold based on actual gains realized by employees 
our quarterly results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that the stock options are exercised by employees and  consequently  the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed 
amortization of acquired intangible assets from time to time we have purchased  and expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses in order to maintain our leadership role in online trading 
these purchases may result in the creation of intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization in the related periods 
our amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in absolute dollars from  or of net revenues to million or of net revenues for the years ended december  and and further increased in absolute dollars to million or of net revenues in the year ended december  we expect the amortization of intangible assets to increase in due to our recent acquisition of internet auction in korea and our agreement to acquire ibazar sa both acquisitions will be accounted for as purchase business combinations 
merger related costs in  ebay incurred direct merger related transaction costs of million which were primarily related to the acquisitions of billpoint  butterfields  kruse and alando 
de 
ag 
in  ebay incurred direct merger transaction costs of million primarily associated with the acquisition of half 
com 
there were no comparable expenses for the same period in as opportunities present themselves  ebay may continue to acquire new companies  such acquisitions could lead to additional direct and indirect expenses which could negatively affect ebay s results of operations 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and investments offset by foreign exchange gains or losses 
our interest and other income  net increased from million or of net revenues to million or of net revenues for the years ended december  and and increased to million or of net revenues in the year ended december  the year over year increases resulted from interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we expect interest and other income will continue to exceed interest expense in provision for income taxes our effective federal and state income tax rates were   and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the tax rates in and include the effects of our acquisitions 
additionally  we receive tax deductions for gains realized by employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recognized as a component of paid in capital 
we have provided for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these stock option deductions 
prior to the acquisition by ebay in  butterfields was taxed as an s corporation 
in connection with the acquisition  butterfields status as an s corporation was terminated  and butterfields became subject to federal and state income taxes 
the supplemental pro forma financial information presented in the financial statements includes an increase to the provisions for income taxes based upon a combined federal and state tax rate 
this rate approximates the statutory tax rate that would have been applied if butterfields were taxed as a c corporation prior to the acquisition 
stock based compensation in connection with granting certain stock options from may through may  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation totaling million  which is being amortized over the four year vesting period of the options 
in connection with certain stock options granted between july and march by companies that we subsequently acquired  we recorded unearned compensation totaling million 
of the total unearned stock compensation  approximately million  million and million was amortized in  and  respectively 
of the amortization in  approximately was related to the acquisition of half 
com 
we expect additional amortization of unearned stock compensation as a result of our acquisition of internet auction and potential acquisition of ibazar sa liquidity and capital resources since inception  ebay has financed operations primarily from net cash generated from operating activities 
we obtained additional financing from the sale of preferred stock and warrants  proceeds from the exercise of those warrants  proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from our net income before non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and changes in accrued expenses offset by changes in accounts receivable and other assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the primary use for invested cash in the periods presented was purchases of investments  property  and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in we remained cash flow positive from financing activities primarily due to our public offering in and our subsequent follow on offering in to a lesser extent  financing activities included the sale of common stock under employee benefit plans 
in  net cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the issuance of common stock to third parties by our subsidiaries 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december   but expect such expenditures to approximate million during without taking into account any acquisitions 
of the million  approximately million has been committed for capital expenditures relating to hardware and software for the development of our new architecture 
the remaining balance will be used primarily for computer equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
we also have total minimum lease obligations of million under certain noncancellable operating leases and notes payable obligations of million through august under our agreement with aol  we will pay aol million over the four year term of the contract 
to date  we have paid million on the contract 
in february  we signed an agreement with go 
com 
in consideration for this agreement  we will pay a minimum of million to go 
com over the four year term 
in  disney announced that it was dissolving go 
com  consequently  ebay is currently in the process of renegotiating new contract terms with disney 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  our business could suffer 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

in july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus with respect to eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
eitf addressed whether a company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of the goods or services or the net amount retained that is  the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a supplier because it has earned a commission or fee 
we adopted eitf  and such adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives 
this consensus provides guidance on the recognition  measurement  and income statement classification of sales incentives which are offered voluntarily by a vendor without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction 
we evaluated the provisions of the guidance in conjunction with our policies and concluded that we are in compliance with this pronouncement 
in july  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 classification in the statement of cash flows of the income tax benefit realized by a company upon employee exercise of a non qualified stock option 
eitf addresses the cash flow statement presentation of the tax benefit associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options

we adopted eitf effective july  such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing ebay 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or such other risks actually occur  our business could be harmed 
we have a limited operating history our company was formed as a sole proprietorship in september and was incorporated in may we have only a limited operating history on which you can base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
as an online commerce company still relatively early in our development  we face substantial risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties 
to address these risks and uncertainties  we and our subsidiaries must do the following maintain and increase our number of registered users  items listed on our service and completed sales  expand into new areas  maintain and grow our website and customer support operations at a reasonable cost  continue to make trading through our service safer for users  maintain and enhance our brand  continue to develop and upgrade our technology and information processing systems  continue to enhance and expand our service to meet the changing requirements of our users  provide superior customer service  remain attractive to our commercial partners  respond to competitive developments  and attract  integrate  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may be unable to accomplish one or more of these goals  which could cause our business to suffer 
in addition  accomplishing one or more of these goals might be very expensive  which could harm our financial results 
our operating results may fluctuate our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following our ability to retain an active user base  to attract new users who list items for sale and who purchase items through our service and to maintain customer satisfaction  our ability to keep our website operational and to manage the number of items listed on our service  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business  operations and infrastructure  foreign  federal  state or local government regulation  including investigations prompted by items improperly listed or sold by our users  the introduction of new sites  services and products by us or our competitors  volume  size  timing and completion rate of trades on our websites  consumer confidence in the security of transactions on our websites  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to accommodate growth  technical difficulties or service interruptions  our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner  our ability to retain key employees in both our online businesses and our acquisitions  our ability to successfully integrate and manage our acquisitions  our ability to successfully expand our product offerings involving fixed price trading  the ability of our land based auction businesses to acquire high quality properties for auction  the timing  cost and availability of advertising in traditional media and on other websites and online services  the timing of payments to us and of marketing and other expenses under existing and future contracts  consumer trends and popularity of some categories of collectible items  the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns  the level of use of the internet and online services  increasing consumer acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce and  in particular  the trading of products such as those listed on our websites  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet and e commerce industries 
our limited operating history and growing competition make it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and almost all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions for items that are listed and sold during that quarter 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
our failure to manage growth could harm us we currently are experiencing a period of expansion in our headcount  facilities and infrastructure  and we anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in our customer base and number of listings as well as our expansion into new geographic areas  types of goods and alternative methods of sale 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
the areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following the websites 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we are regularly introducing 
this is expensive and the increased complexity of our websites increases the cost of additional enhancements 
if we are unable to increase the capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand for this capacity  our websites may become unstable and may cease to operate for periods of time 
we have experienced periodic unscheduled downtime 
continued unscheduled downtime would harm our business and also could anger users of our website and reduce future revenues 
customer support 
we are expanding our customer support operations to accommodate the increased number of users and transactions on our websites 
if we are unable to hire and successfully train sufficient employees or contractors in this area in a cost effective manner  users of our websites may have negative experiences  and current and future revenues could suffer or our margins may decrease 
customer accounts 
our revenues are dependent on prompt and accurate billing processes 
if we are unable to grow our transaction processing abilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed  our ability to collect revenue will be harmed 
we must continue to hire  train and manage new employees at a rapid rate 
the majority of our employees today have been with us less than one year and we expect that our rate of hiring will continue at a very high pace 
if our new hires perform poorly  or if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training and integrating these new employees  or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
this is a special challenge when we acquire new operations with different systems 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
we may be unable to hire  train  retain and manage required personnel or to identify and take advantage of existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities 
we may not maintain profitability we believe that our continued profitability will depend in large part on our ability to do the following maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers  manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our websites  customer support and international and product expansion  increase our brand name awareness  and provide our customers with superior community and trading experiences 
we are investing heavily in marketing and promotion  customer support  further development of our websites  technology and operating infrastructure development 
the costs of these investments are expected to remain significant into the future 
in addition  we have significant ongoing commitments in some of these areas 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
the existence of several larger and more established companies that are enabling online sales as well as new companies  many of whom do not charge for transactions on their sites and others who are facilitating trading through other pricing formats eg fixed price  reverse auction  group buying  etc 
may limit our ability to raise user fees in response to declines in profitability 
in addition  we are spending in advance of anticipated growth  which may also harm our profitability 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely upon our historical results as indications of our future performance 
acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other harmful consequences we have acquired a number of businesses  including our recently completed acquisitions of half 
com and internet auction company ltd 
in korea and our announced acquisition of ibazar sa  and may in the future acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are strategic 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time at both companies during the period of negotiation through closing and further diversion of such time after closing from focus on operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  decline in employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  and the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had been smaller  private companies 
prior to the four large acquisitions we made in  we had almost no experience in managing this integration process 
many of our acquisitions to date have involved either family run companies or very early stage companies  which may worsen these integration issues 
foreign acquisitions involve special risks including those related to integration of operations across different cultures  currency risks and the particular economic and political risks associated with specific countries 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions may not be realized 
future acquisitions or mergers could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
future acquisitions or mergers may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
even if available  this financing may be dilutive 
the inability to expand our systems may limit our growth we seek to generate a high volume of traffic and transactions on our service 
the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our websites  processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain large numbers of users 
our revenues depend primarily on the number of items listed by users  the volume of user transactions that are successfully completed and the final prices paid for the items listed 
we need to expand and upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure both to meet increased traffic on our site and to implement new features and functions  including those required under our contracts with third parties 
we may be unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our service or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely fashion 
we use internally developed systems to operate our service for transaction processing  including billing and collections processing 
we must continually improve these systems in order to accommodate the level of use of our website 
in addition  we may add new features and functionality to our services that would result in the need to develop or license additional technologies 
we capitalize hardware and software costs associated with this development in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include such amounts in property and equipment 
our inability to add additional software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could have adverse consequences 
these consequences include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of the users experience of our service and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
our failure to provide new features or functionality also could result in these consequences 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or to integrate smoothly any newly developed or purchased technologies with our existing systems 
these difficulties could harm or limit our ability to expand our business 
unauthorized break ins or other assaults on our service could harm our business our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data  public release of confidential data or the inability to complete customer transactions 
in addition  unauthorized persons may improperly access our data 
we have experienced an unauthorized break in by a hacker who has stated that he can in the future damage or change our system or take confidential information 
we have also experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our website unavailable for periods of time 
these and other types of attacks could harm us 
actions of this sort may be very expensive to remedy and could damage our reputation and discourage new and existing users from using our service 
there are many risks associated with our international operations we are expanding internationally 
in  we acquired alando 
de 
ag  a leading online german personal trading platform  and began operations in the united kingdom and  through a joint venture  in australia 
in the first quarter of  we further expanded into japan and formally launched our localized canadian operations 
in october  we launched our french site 
in january  we launched our italian site 
in february  we completed our acquisition of a majority interest in internet auction company  ltd 
and announced our intended acquisition of ibazar sa  a french company with online trading operations in eight countries  primarily in europe 
expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources 
we have limited experience in localizing our service to conform to local cultures  standards and policies 
in most countries  we will have to compete with local companies who understand the local market better than we do 
we may not be successful in expanding into international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
even if we are successful  the costs of operating are expected to exceed our net revenues for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand internationally  we are subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following regulatory requirements  including regulation of auctions  that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in local jurisdictions  may prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers or may prohibit certain categories of goods  legal uncertainty regarding liability for the listings of our users  including less internet friendly legal systems  unique local laws and lack of clear precedent or applicable law  government imposed limitations on the public s access to the internet  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices and problems in collecting accounts receivable  higher telecommunications and internet service provider costs  more stringent consumer protection laws  cultural non acceptance of online trading  stronger local competitors  seasonal reductions in business activity  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
some of these factors may cause our international costs to exceed our domestic costs of doing business 
to the extent we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our revenue from end to end service providers  commercial partners and advertising is subject to factors beyond our control we are receiving revenues from end to end service providers  commercial partnerships and direct advertising promotions 
these revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online promotions generally 
the profitability of online advertisements has deteriorated markedly recently 
our direct advertising revenue is dependent in significant part on the performance of aol s sales force  which we do not control 
reduction in these revenues  whether due to the softening of the demand for online advertising in general or particular problems facing parties with whom we have commercial relationships  could adversely affect our results 
our business may be harmed by the listing or sale by our users of illegal items the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is currently unsettled 
we are aware that certain goods  such as firearms  other weapons  adult material  tobacco products  alcohol and other goods that may be subject to regulation by local  state or federal authorities  have been listed and traded on our service 
we may be unable to prevent the sale of unlawful goods  or the sale of goods in an unlawful manner  by users of our service  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service 
we have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations 
see we are subject to intellectual property and other litigation and legal proceedings 
in order to reduce our exposure to this liability  we have prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the number of personnel reviewing questionable items 
we may in the future implement other protective measures that could require us to spend substantial resources and or to reduce revenues by discontinuing certain service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods  could harm our business 
in addition  we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods on our website 
this negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name 
it also could make users reluctant to continue to use our services 
our business may be harmed by the listing or sale by our users of pirated items we have received in the past  and we anticipate we will receive in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and tradenames or other intellectual property rights 
although we have actively sought to work with the content community to eliminate infringing listings on our website  some content owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
content owners have been active in defending their rights against online companies  including ebay 
an allegation of infringement of third party intellectual property rights may result in litigation against us 
any such litigation could be costly for us  could result in increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  or could otherwise harm our business 
litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs 
see legal proceedings and risk factors we are subject to intellectual property and other litigation 
our business may be harmed by fraudulent activities on our website our future success will depend largely upon sellers reliably delivering and accurately representing their listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price 
we have received in the past  and anticipate that we will receive in the future  communications from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged 
in some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our website 
while we can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users  we do not have the ability to require users to make payments or deliver goods or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited insurance program 
other than through this program  we do not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users 
we also periodically receive complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
negative publicity generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our service could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name 
we expect to continue to receive requests from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
this sort of litigation could be costly for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments or could otherwise harm our business 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties on january   we received initial requests to produce certain records and information to the federal government relating to an investigation of possible illegal transactions in connection with our website 
we were informed that the inquiry includes an examination of our practices with respect to these transactions 
we have provided further information in connection with this ongoing inquiry 
in order to protect the investigation  the court has ordered that no further public disclosures be made with respect to the matter 
on march   butterfields received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the department of justice requesting documents relating to  among other things  changes in butterfields seller commissions and buyer premiums and discussions  agreements or understandings with other auction houses  in each case since we believe this request may be related to a publicly reported criminal investigation of auction houses for price fixing 
we have provided the information requested in the subpoena 
should these or any other investigations lead to civil or criminal charges against us  we would likely be harmed by negative publicity  the costs of litigation  the diversion of management time and other negative effects  even if we ultimately prevail 
our business would suffer if we were not to prevail in any actions like these 
even the process of providing records and information can be expensive  time consuming and result in the diversion of management attention 
a large number of transactions occur on our website 
we believe that government regulators have received a substantial number of consumer complaints about us which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  we have from time to time been contacted by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies and been told that they have questions with respect to the adequacy of the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
we are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  which may lead to action against us 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  the resultant investigations and potential fines or other penalties could harm our business 
we have provided information to the antitrust division of the department of justice in connection with an inquiry into our conduct with respect to auction aggregators including our licensing program and our recently settled lawsuit against bidder s edge 
should the division decide to take action against us  we would likely be harmed by negative publicity  the costs of the action  possible private antitrust lawsuits  the diversion of management time and effort and penalties we might suffer if we ultimately were not to prevail 
some of our businesses are subject to regulation and others may be in the future both butterfields and kruse are subject to regulation in some jurisdictions governing the manner in which live auctions are conducted 
both are required to obtain licenses in these jurisdictions with respect to their business or to permit the sale of categories of items eg wine  automobiles and real estate 
these licenses generally must be renewed regularly and are subject to revocation for violation of law  violation of the regulations governing auctions in general or the sale of the particular item and other events 
if either company was unable to renew a license or had a license revoked  its business would be harmed 
in addition  changes to the regulations or the licensure requirements could increase the complexity and the cost of doing auctions  thereby harming us 
as our activities and the types of goods listed on our site expand  state regulatory agencies may claim that we are subject to licensure in their jurisdiction 
these claims could result in costly litigation or could require us to change our manner of doing business in ways that increase our costs or reduce our revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties 
any of these outcomes could harm our business 
as we have expanded internationally  we have become subject to new regulations  including regulations on the transmission of personal information 
these laws may require costly changes to our business practices 
if we are found to have violated any of these laws  we could be subject to fines or penalties  and our business could be harmed 
companies that handle payments  including our subsidiaries billpoint and half 
com may be subject to additional regulation the half 
com business model involves the handling of payments by buyers for the items listed by half 
com s sellers 
internet auction company  ltd 
also has a business model involving the handling of payments by buyers 
billpoint handles its customer funds as a provider of internet payment solutions 
businesses that handle consumers funds are subject to numerous regulations  including those related to banking  credit cards  escrow  fair credit reporting and others 
billpoint is a new business with a relatively novel approach to facilitating payments 
it is not yet known how regulatory agencies will treat billpoint 
the cost and complexity of billpoint s business may increase if certain regulations are deemed to apply to its business 
in addition to the need to comply with these regulations  billpoint s business is also subject to risks of fraud  the need to grow systems and processes rapidly if its products are well received  a high level of competition  including larger and better financed competitors and the need to coordinate systems and policies among itself  us and wells fargo bank  which is the provider of payment services 
similarly  half 
com may be subject to certain regulations regarding payments and the cost and complexity of its business may increase if these regulations are deemed to apply to its business 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled 
claims could be made against online services companies under both united states and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon us have brought against us 
in addition  federal  state and foreign legislation has been proposed that imposes liability for or prohibits the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  it is possible that a claim of defamation or other injury could be made against us for content posted in the feedback forum 
claims like these become more likely and have a higher probability of success in jurisdictions outside the us if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources and or to discontinue certain service offerings  which would negatively affect our financial results 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business 
any costs incurred as a result of this liability or asserted liability could harm our business 
we are subject to intellectual property and other litigation on september   we were served with a lawsuit filed by randall stoner  on behalf of the general public  in san francisco superior court no 

the lawsuit alleged that we violated section of the california business professions code  a statute that relates to unfair competition  based upon the listing of bootleg or pirate recordings by ebay s users  allegedly in violation of california penal statutes relating to the sale of unauthorized audio recordings 
the lawsuit sought declaratory and injunctive relief  restitution and legal fees 
we filed a general demurrer which was sustained by the court with leave to amend 
the plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint 
we filed a motion for summary judgement 
on november   our motion for summary judgement was granted 
on december   we sued bidder s edge  inc in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging trespass  unfair competition  violation of the computer fraud and abuse act  misappropriation  false advertising  trademark dilution  injury to business reputation  interference with prospective economic advantage  and unjust enrichment 
on february   bidder s edge denied these claims and counterclaimed against us alleging that we violated the antitrust laws by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize a market  that we competed unfairly  and that we interfered with their contract with ebay magazine 
bidder s edge sought treble damages  an injunction and its fees and costs 
on may   the court granted us a preliminary injunction against the use by bidder s edge of robotic means to copy our site 
in february  the parties settled this lawsuit 
all claims by both parties were dismissed  and bidder s edge paid us an undisclosed amount 
on april   we were served with a lawsuit  gentry et 
al 
v 
ebay  inc et 
al  filed in superior court in san diego  california 
the lawsuit was filed on behalf of a purported class of ebay users who purchased allegedly forged autographed sports memorabilia on ebay 
the lawsuit claims we were negligent in permitting certain named and other unnamed defendants to sell allegedly forged autographed sports memorabilia on ebay 
in addition  the lawsuit claims we violated section and a section of the california civil code which prohibits dealers from selling sports memorabilia without a certificate of authenticity 
on january   the court issued a ruling dismissing all claims against us in the lawsuit 
the court ruled that our business falls within the safe harbor provisions of usc  which grants internet service providers such as ebay with immunity from state claims based on the conduct of third parties 
the court also noted that we were not a dealer under california law and thus not required to provide certificates of authenticity with autographs sold over our site by third parties 
all counts of the plaintiffs suit were dismissed with prejudice as to ebay 
plaintiffs have filed an appeal of this ruling 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
other third parties have from time to time claimed and may claim in the future that we have infringed their past  current or future intellectual property rights 
we may become more vulnerable to such claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act are interpreted by the courts 
we expect that we will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our segment grow 
these claims whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements  if available 
as a result  these claims could harm our business 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
system failures could harm our business we have experienced system failures from time to time 
our website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  these outages create a flood of user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel 
any unscheduled interruption in our service results in an immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to switch to our competitors 
if we experience frequent or persistent system failures  our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed 
we have been taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system 
these steps are expensive  reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
substantially all of our computer hardware for operating our services other than half 
com currently is located at the facilities of exodus communications  inc in santa clara  california and abovenet communications in san jose  california 
the computer hardware for the half 
com service is located in the facilities of level communications in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
we do not maintain fully redundant systems or alternative providers of hosting services  and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at any of the exodus  abovenet or level facilities could result in interruptions in our services 
in addition  the failure by exodus  abovenet or level to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service 
interruptions in our service will reduce our revenues and profits  and our future revenues and profits will be harmed if our users believe that our system is unreliable 
risks relating to possible california power outages the state of california is currently experiencing a chronic shortage of power and  as a result  power outages may occur 
although we have emergency backup power capabilities at the facilities of exodus  abovenet  level communications and limited backup power at our headquarters  repeated or lengthy power outages may adversely affect our business 
our stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be extremely volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  unscheduled system downtime  additions or departures of key personnel  announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet and online commerce industries  changes in the market valuations of other internet companies  developments in internet regulation  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the trading price of internet stocks in general  and ours in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent periods 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
the valuations of many internet stocks  including ours  are extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios 
the trading price of our common stock has increased enormously from the initial public offering price 
these trading prices and valuations may not be sustained 
any negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of internet or e commerce companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results 
other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  also may decrease the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following declines in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted 
litigation of this type  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
new and existing regulations could harm our business we are subject to the same federal  state and local laws as other companies conducting business on the internet 
today there are relatively few laws specifically directed towards online services 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet and online services  many laws relating to the internet are being debated at the state and federal levels both in the us and abroad and it is possible that laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the internet or online services 
these laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  fraud  content and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights and information security 
applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the digital millennium copyright act  are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain 
in addition  numerous states  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding how auctions may be conducted and the liability of auctioneers in conducting such auctions 
no final legal determination has been made with respect to the applicability of the california regulations to our business to date and little precedent exists in this area 
several states are considering imposing these regulations upon us or our users  which could harm our business 
in addition  as the nature of the products listed by our users change  we may become subject to new regulatory restrictions 
several states have proposed legislation that would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies 
the federal trade commission also has settled several proceedings regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties 
changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws intended to address these issues could directly affect the way we do business or could create uncertainty on the internet 
this could reduce demand for our services  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws 
for example  a french court has recently ruled that a us website must comply with french laws regarding content 
as we have expanded our international activities  we have become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate 
laws regulating internet companies outside of the united states may be less favorable then those in the united states  giving greater rights to consumers  content owners and users 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings relative to those in the united states 
our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from fines to bans on our ability to offer our services 
our business has been seasonal our results of operations historically have been somewhat seasonal in nature because many of our users reduce their activities on our website during the thanksgiving and christmas holidays and with the onset of good weather 
we have historically experienced our strongest quarter of online growth in our first fiscal quarter  although our shift to more practical items may cause our seasonal patterns to look more like a typical retailer 
both butterfields and kruse have significant quarter to quarter variations in their results of operations depending on the timing of auctions and the availability of high quality items from large collections and estates 
butterfields typically has its best operating results in the traditional fall and spring auction seasons and has historically incurred operating losses in the first and third quarters 
kruse typically sees a seasonal peak in operations in the third quarter 
seasonal or cyclical variations in our business may become more pronounced over time and may harm our results of operations in the future 
we are dependent on the continued growth of online commerce the business of selling goods over the internet  particularly through personal trading  is new and dynamic 
our future net revenues and profits will be substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance of the internet and online services as a medium for commerce by consumers 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet and online services is a recent phenomenon 
this acceptance and use may not continue 
even if the internet is accepted  concerns about fraud  privacy and other problems may mean that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will not adopt the internet as a medium of commerce 
in particular  our website requires users to make publicly available their e mail addresses and other personal information that some potential users may be unwilling to provide 
these concerns may increase as additional publicity over privacy issues on ebay or generally over the internet increase 
market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet is highly uncertain  and there are few proven services and products 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods 
if these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users  and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs  including our cost of acquiring new customers  our business could be adversely impacted 
our business may be subject to sales and other taxes we do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods sold by users through our service 
one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on companies such as ours that engage in or facilitate online commerce 
several proposals have been made at the state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of e commerce  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
in  the us federal government enacted legislation prohibiting states or other local authorities from imposing new taxes on internet commerce for a period of three years 
this tax moratorium will last only for a limited period and does not prohibit states or the internal revenue service from collecting taxes on our income  if any  or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules 
a successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that we should collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of merchandise on our system would harm our business 
we are dependent on key personnel our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel 
our future performance also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our other officers and key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
our new businesses are all dependent on attracting and retaining key personnel 
the land based auction businesses are particularly dependent on specialists and senior management because of the relationships these individuals have established with sellers who consign property for sale at auction 
we have had some turnover of these personnel  and continued losses could result in the loss of significant future business and would harm us 
in addition  employee turnover frequently increases during the period following an acquisition as employees evaluate possible changes in compensation  culture  reporting relationships  and the direction of the business 
such increased turnover could increase our costs and reduce our future revenues 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially for engineers and other professionals  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
our offline auction businesses need to continue to acquire auction properties the businesses of butterfields and kruse are dependent on the continued acquisition of high quality auction properties from sellers 
their future success will depend in part on their ability to maintain an adequate supply of high quality auction property  particularly fine and decorative arts and collectibles and collectible automobiles  respectively 
there is intense competition for these pieces with other auction companies and dealers 
in addition  a small number of key senior management and specialists maintain the relationships with the primary sources of auction property and the loss of any of these individuals could harm the business of butterfields and kruse 
our offline auction businesses could suffer losses from price guarantees  advances or rescissions of sales in order to secure high quality auction properties from sellers  butterfields and kruse may give a guaranteed minimum price or a cash advance to a seller  based on the estimated value of the property 
if the auction proceeds are less than the amount guaranteed  or less than the amount advanced and the seller does not repay the difference  the company involved will suffer a loss 
in addition  under certain circumstances a buyer who believes that an item purchased at auction does not have good title  provenance or authenticity may rescind the purchase 
under these circumstances  the company involved will lose its commissions and fees on the sale even if the seller  in accordance with the terms and conditions of sale  in turn accepts back the item and returns the funds he or she received from the sale 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property in connection with the acquisitions of kruse and butterfields we acquired real property including land  buildings and interests in partnerships holding land and buildings 
we have no experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to new risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhoods in which the properties are located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability act or other requirements  and possible disputes with tenants  partners or others 
our market is intensely competitive depending on the category of product  we currently or potentially compete with a number of companies serving particular categories of goods as well as those serving broader ranges of goods 
the internet is a new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive area 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as the barriers to entry are relatively low  and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software 
our broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department and general merchandise stores as well as emerging online retailers 
these include most prominently wal mart  kmart  target  sears  macy s  jc penney  costco  sam s club as well as amazon 
com  buy 
com  aol 
com  yahoo shopping and msn 
in addition  we face competition from specialty retailers and exchanges in each of its categories of products

com  the fairmarket auction network an auction network including microsoft s msn  excite home  dell computer  zd net  lycos and more than others  first auction  surplus auction  ubid  yahoo auctions and a large number of other companies using an auction format for consumer to consumer or business to consumer sales 
overseas  we face competition from yahoo auctions in most countries and from a large number of regional and national competitors in each country 
the principal competitive factors for ebay include the following ability to attract buyers  volume of transactions and selection of goods  customer service  and brand recognition 
with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors are community cohesion and interaction  system reliability  reliability of delivery and payment  website convenience and accessibility  level of service fees  and quality of search tools 
some current and potential competitors have longer company operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet spaces than we do 
some of these competitors also have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
other online trading services may be acquired by  receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we are able to 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brand 
some of our competitors have offered services for free  and others may do this as well 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in order to respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our business 
for example  we have implemented an insurance program that generally insures items up to a value of  with a deductible  for users with a non negative feedback rating at no cost to the user 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service 
some internet based applications that direct internet traffic to certain websites may channel users to trading services that compete with us 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our service 
in addition  companies that control access to transactions through network access or internet browsers could promote our competitors or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
the off line auction business is intensely competitive 
butterfields competes with two larger and better known auction companies  sotheby s holdings  inc and christie s international plc  as well as numerous regional auction companies 
to the extent that these companies increase their focus on the middle market properties that form the core of butterfields business or in the western united states  its business may suffer 
kruse is subject to competition from numerous regional competitors 
in addition  competition with internet based auctions may harm the land based auction business 
although billpoint s business is new  several new companies have entered this space  including competitors who are offering free services and significant promotional incentives  and large companies  including banks and credit card companies  are also beginning to enter this space 
half 
com competes directly with online retailers in its product categories such as amazon 
com which offers a directly competitive service  as well as with traditional sellers of used books  videos and cds 
our business is dependent on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure the success of our service will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  increased frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it 
in addition  the performance of the internet may be harmed by increased number of users or bandwidth requirements 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the level of traffic and the processing transactions on our service 
our business is subject to online commerce security risks a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches 
our failure to prevent security breaches could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
billpoint s users routinely provide credit card and other financial information 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer transaction data 
a number of websites have reported breaches of their security 
any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and  therefore  our business 
in addition  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
an individual has claimed to have misappropriated some of our confidential information by breaking into our computer system 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate 
security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive the space in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands 
these characteristics are worsened by the emerging and changing nature of the internet 
our future success therefore will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies  to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our service 
our failure to adapt to such changes would harm our business 
new technologies  such as the development of a peer to peer personal trading technology  could adversely affect us 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
we need to develop new services  features and functions in order to expand we plan to expand our operations by developing new or complementary services  products or transaction formats or expanding the breadth and depth of services 
we may be unable to expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner 
even if we do expand  we may not maintain or increase our overall acceptance 
if we launch a new business or service that is not favorably received by consumers  it could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand 
we anticipate that future services will include pre and post trade services 
we are pursuing strategic relationships with third parties to provide many of these services 
because we use third parties to deliver these services  we may be unable to control the quality of these services and our ability to address problems if any of these third parties fails to perform adequately will be reduced 
expanding our operations in this manner also will require significant additional expenses and development  operations and other resources and will strain our management  financial and operational resources 
the lack of acceptance of any new services could harm our business 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brand we believe that our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of mouth 
we have benefited from frequent and high visibility media exposure both nationally and locally 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our service 
promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services 
in order to promote our brand  we will need to increase our marketing budget and otherwise increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand loyalty among users 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand 
if we do attract new users to our service  they may not conduct transactions over our service on a regular basis 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand  our business would be harmed 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately we regard the protection of our urls  copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements and the other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
we pursue the registration of our urls  trademarks and service marks in the us and internationally 
effective copyright  service mark  trademark  trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain  and protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available online 
furthermore  we must also protect our urls in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to third parties 
these licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
we also rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties  such as oracle corporation  microsoft corporation and sun microsystems inc  the suppliers of key database technologies  the operating system and specific hardware components for our service 
these third party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of these technologies could require us to obtain substitute technologies of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost 
our business is subject to consumer trends and discretionary consumer spending we derive most of our revenues from fees received from sellers for listing products for sale on our service and fees received from successfully completed transactions 
our future revenues will depend upon continued demand for the types of goods that are listed by users of our service 
the popularity of certain categories of items  such as toys  dolls and memorabilia  among consumers may vary over time due to perceived scarcity  subjective value  and societal and consumer trends in general 
a decline in the popularity of  or demand for  certain collectibles or other items sold through our service could reduce the overall volume of transactions on our service  resulting in reduced revenues 
in addition  consumer fads may temporarily inflate the volume of certain types of items listed on our service  placing a significant strain upon our infrastructure and transaction capacity 
these trends also may cause fluctuations in our operating results from one reporting period to the next 
any decline in demand for the goods offered through our service as a result of changes in consumer trends could harm our business 
a decline in consumer spending would harm our land based auction businesses 
sales of fine and decorative art  collectable cars and other collectibles would be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending  especially for luxury items 
changes in buyers tastes  economic conditions or consumer trends could cause declines in the number or dollar volume of items sold and thereby harm the business of these companies 
some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
we are controlled by certain stockholders  executive officers and directors our executive officers and directors and their affiliates own approximately one half of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  they have the ability to control our company and direct our affairs and business  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
any of these events could decrease the market price of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of estimated tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  longer dated securities are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter dated securities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately and had a weighted average maturity of years 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points using a duration modeling technique  the fair market value of the total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately million 
assuming an average investment balance of million  if rates were to increase decrease by basis points  this would translate to an increase decrease in interest income of million annually 
we entered into two interest rate swaps on june and july  totaling million to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the floating rate operating lease for our facilities 
the interest rate swaps allow for us to receive floating rate receipts based on libor in exchange for making fixed rate payments which effectively changes our interest rate exposure on our operating lease from a floating rate to a fixed rate on million of the total million operating lease 
of the million operating lease  the interest rate is fixed on million with the balance of million remaining at a floating rate of interest based on the spread over month libor 
if the month libor rates were to increase decrease by basis points  then our lease payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity investments as such investments we hold  typically as the result of strategic investments in strategic partners are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments 
as of december   the position in equity investments included a net unrealized loss of million  net of tax 
foreign currency risk international sales are made mostly from our sales in the respective countries by our foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
these financial statements are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on ebay as of december  was a translation gain of approximately
