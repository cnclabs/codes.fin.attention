an additional nine franchise restaurants were also operating under the name famous dave s 
seventeen restaurants were located in minnesota  eight in illinois  six in wisconsin  three each in iowa and maryland  two each in utah and virginia and one in nebraska 
two additional company owned units were under construction in the chicago area as of december  and opened in the first quarter of one additional franchise restaurant was under construction in omaha  nebraska  which also opened during the first quarter of the famous dave s concept our restaurants  a majority of which offer full table service  feature hickory smoked off the grill meat entree favorites served in one of our three casual formats a northwoods style lodge  a nostalgic roadhouse shack  or a blues club featuring nightly musical entertainment 
we seek to differentiate ourselves by providing high quality food in these distinctive and comfortable environments 
in may  nation s restaurant news  a leading restaurant industry publication  named famous dave s of america  inc a hot concept 
key elements of our concept include the following high quality food 
each restaurant features a distinctive selection of authentic hickory smoked off the grill favorites such as flame grilled st 
louis style ribs  texas beef brisket  georgia chopped pork  country roasted chicken  and generous signature sandwiches and salads 
enticing side items such as honey buttered corn bread  potato salad  coleslaw  shack fries tm and wilbur beans tm accompany the broad entree selection 
homemade desserts  including famous dave s bread pudding and hot fudge kahlua tm brownies  are a specialty 
to complement our smoked meat entree and appetizer items and to suit different customer tastes  famous dave s bbq sauces come in six variations rich sassy tm  texas pit tm  georgia mustard tm  hot sassy tm  devil s spit tm and sweet and zesty tm 
these sauces and a variety of prepared meats and seasonings are also distributed throughout the country under licensing agreements in retail grocery stores 
we believe that our high quality food is a principal point of differentiation between famous dave s and other casual dining competitors and is a significant contributing factor to our level of repeat business 
distinctive environment decor and music 
in late  we introduced the lodge format which features decor reminiscent of a comfortable northwoods hunting lodge with a full service dining room and bar 
by the end of fiscal  we operated ten units under the lodge format  including two locations in each of the minneapolis and utah markets  three in the metropolitan chicago area and one each in lincoln  nebraska and sterling  virginia 
our original theme  a nostalgic roadhouse shack shack is promoted by the abundant use of rustic antiques  items of americana from the s and s and emphasizes a very casual experience with emphasis on value and speed of delivery 
while initially the shack format only offered counter service  fourteen shacks have been opened as or converted to full service dining 
in addition  we have developed a larger blues club format that features authentic chicago blues club decor and live music seven nights a week 
we currently operate one blues club in the minneapolis market and one in downtown chicago 
broad based appeal 
we believe that our concept has broader appeal than many other restaurant concepts because it attracts customers of all ages and the menu offers a variety of items that appeal to many tastes 
we believe that our distinctive concept  combined with our high quality food  make famous dave s appealing to children  teenagers and adults of all ages 
operating strategy key elements of our operating strategy include the following operational simplicity 
in our counter service shacks  we strive to emphasize value and speed of service by employing a streamlined operating system based on a focused menu and simplified food preparation techniques 
the counter service shack menu focuses on a number of popular smoked meat barbecue entree items and delicious side dishes which are prepared using easy to operate kitchen equipment and processes that use prepared seasonings  sauces and mixes 
this streamlined food preparation system helps lower the cost of operation by requiring fewer staff  lower training costs and the elimination of a need for highly compensated chefs 
by controlling the number of menu items and using simplified food preparation processes  meals can be served quickly and consistently 
in the full service restaurants  we seek to provide a broader menu that will appeal to a variety of tastes and may be used on more frequent dining occasions 
to enhance our appeal and expand our audience  we have added such items as catfish fingers  specialty salads and other promotional products 
as the menu broadens and food preparation techniques become more focused on meals prepared to order  an increased training requirement is necessary in order to prepare our staff for increased sophistication in guest service 
additional staff costs and training expense is justified  we believe  by the greater revenue produced by the full service restaurants when compared to counter service restaurants 
average weekly volume for the twenty three full service restaurants was  with ten restaurants above this average and thirteen below 
the range was from a low of  to a high of  per week 
average weekly volume for the seven counter service restaurants was  with three restaurants above this average and four below 
the range was from a low of  to a high of  per week recruiting  training and retaining employees 
we believe that a key component of the success of our concept rests with the ability to hire  train and motivate qualified restaurant employees 
we believe that by providing training  competitive compensation and opportunities for employee involvement and advancement  we encourage a sense of personal commitment from our employees 
in  we instituted hog heaven university  which augments our technical training with programs aimed at improving the personal development skills of our managers 
we believe that our competitive compensation  employee involvement and streamlined operating system help enable us to attract and retain qualified restaurant managers and employees 
take out focus on customer convenience 
we seek to provide our customers with maximum convenience by offering convenient take out service in addition to our lively and entertaining sit down experience 
we believe that famous dave s entrees and side dishes are viewed by guests as traditional american picnic foods that maintain their quality and travel particularly well  making them an attractive choice to replace a home cooked meal 
we believe the high quality  reasonable cost and avoidance of preparation time make take out of our product particularly attractive to customers  and approximately of our restaurant revenues are derived from this method 
our restaurants have been designed specifically to accommodate a significant level of take out sales  including a separate take out counter 
in addition  we have added a drive thru window to an existing counter service shack and are evaluating its impact on sales 
style of service 
a majority of our locations utilize a full service style of serving guests 
through  all of our shacks used a more limited  counter style of service with self service seating and drink selection 
in  four of these units were converted to full service locations  and six more shacks were opened as full service facilities 
on december   we acquired four full service locations in the washington dc market and converted them to famous dave s during fiscal in fiscal we opened seven additional full service locations 
we continue to evaluate the advantages of the full service format on a location by location basis 
customer satisfaction 
we believe that we have achieved a significant level of repeat business by providing high quality food and efficient friendly service  in an entertaining environment at moderate prices 
we strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the training and supervision of personnel and the establishment of and adherence to high standards of personnel performance  food preparation and facility maintenance 
we have also built family friendly strategies into each restaurant s food  service and design by providing children s menus  smaller sized entrees at reduced prices and changing tables in restrooms 
attractive value to price relationship 
famous dave s offers high quality food and distinctive atmosphere at competitive prices to encourage frequent patronage 
lunch and dinner entrees range from to resulting in an average check of approximately during fiscal expansion strategy we believe that the casual dining niche of the restaurant industry offers strong growth opportunities for us because this niche of the restaurant market is highly fragmented 
the key elements of our growth strategy include the following targeted expansion 
we believe that there are significant growth opportunities for famous dave s restaurants throughout the united states 
we generally intend to enter new markets with a full service restaurant in high profile  heavy traffic retail locations in order to build brand awareness 
we currently plan to concentrate our expansion primarily in markets where multiple restaurants can be opened  thereby expanding consumer awareness and creating opportunities for operating  distribution and marketing efficiencies 
in late  we opened our first lodge restaurant and currently anticipate using this format as our primary growth vehicle 
we anticipate opening six to eight additional units in fiscal and plan to target our expansion in the chicago and washington dc baltimore markets 
we intend to finance our development through the use of cash flow  funds available under existing and future lines of credit  and through forms of real estate related financing such as mortgages  sale leaseback financing  build to suit arrangements  and other similar financing 
on march  we closed on a sale leaseback financing transaction that provided net proceeds of approximately million  and as of december  we had mortgage financing that provided approximately million for continued development 
there can be no assurance that any future financing will be available  nor on terms acceptable to us 
flexible unit formats because of variable unit formats  we believe we can tailor the famous dave s concept to a variety of markets  demographic areas and real estate locations 
management believes the flexibility in building size  type of construction and configuration  as well as a variable service structure permits locations in a variety of economic and demographic areas throughout different markets 
franchise program at december  we had nine franchise units in operation  three each in minnesota  wisconsin and illinois 
area development agreements representing commitments from franchisees to build an additional restaurants were in place as of december  there can be no assurance that these franchisees will fulfill these commitments 
we continue to pursue a more aggressive franchise program for our restaurants and anticipate that ten to twelve additional franchise units will open during fiscal restaurant operations management and employees our ability to manage multiple  geographically diverse units will be central to our overall success 
our management team includes experienced personnel with extensive restaurant experience 
at the unit level  we place specific emphasis on the position of general manager general manager and seek employees with significant restaurant experience and management expertise 
we strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our units through the careful training and supervision of personnel and the establishment of  and adherence to  high standards relating to personnel performance  food and beverage preparation  and maintenance of facilities 
we attempt to attract high quality  experienced restaurant management and personnel with competitive compensation and bonus programs 
all general managers must complete a training program  during which they are instructed in areas such as food quality and preparation  customer service  and employee relations 
we have prepared operations manuals relating to food and beverage quality and service standards 
new staff members participate in approximately three weeks of training under the close supervision of our management 
we strive to instill enthusiasm and dedication in our employees and regularly solicit employee suggestions concerning our operations and endeavors in order to be responsive to employees concerns 
in addition  we have numerous programs designed to recognize and reward employees for superior performance 
staffing levels at each restaurant vary according to the time of day and size of the restaurant 
however  in general each shack or lodge unit has between and employees 
purchasing we strive to obtain consistent quality items at competitive prices from reliable sources 
in order to maximize operating efficiencies and to provide the freshest ingredients for our food products while obtaining the lowest possible prices for the required quality  each unit s management team determines the daily quantities of food items needed and orders such quantities from major suppliers designated by us which are then shipped directly to the restaurants 
approximately of the products used by famous dave s restaurants are obtained under a supply arrangement with a major foodservice supplier 
included in the distribution and supply arrangement is a provision to distribute pork and meat products provided under a separate contract with a national meatpacking concern 
we entered into a revised contract with this meat supplier during that resulted in the reduction of certain meat prices  particularly pork  for part of and for a portion of during the early part of  we modified this agreement to include fixed prices on certain pork products that had fallen in price during the contract term 
contract pricing accounts for approximately of all of our food purchases 
these contracts are typically negotiated during the second quarter of each year and fix purchase prices for twelve months 
as a result of our negotiated purchase prices  the cost of these food items  taken as a whole  have been essentially flat from to and from to we believe that our relationships with our distributor and food suppliers are excellent  and anticipate no interruption in the supply of product delivered by any of these firms 
in case of a supply disruption  however  we believe we could obtain competitive products and prices on short notice from a number of alternative suppliers 
management information systems we have developed restaurant level management information systems that include a computerized point of sale system which facilitates the movement of customer orders between the customer areas and kitchen operations  processes credit card transactions  and provides management with revenue and other key operating and financial information 
we also use a time management system which tracks the time worked by each employee  allowing management to more effectively manage labor costs through better scheduling of employee work hours 
our unit level point of sale  time management and inventory management systems provide data for posting to our general ledger and to other accounting subsystems 
the general ledger system provides various management reports comparing actual and budgeted results 
the results are reported to and reviewed by management 
such reporting includes i daily reports of revenues  ii weekly reports of selected controllable unit expenses and iii detailed monthly reports of revenues and expenses 
we continue to develop and implement new enhancements to our systems  and a number of new developments in communication  food and labor cost management and unit level efficiency are among the enhancements we are evaluating at the present time 
marketing and promotion marketing and promotion for the owned and operated restaurants have relied primarily upon an extensive publicity effort  direct mail  and walls property line marketing 
our business plan calls for the expenditure of approximately of revenues on marketing and advertising 
in addition  we are also creating awareness and equity in the famous dave s brand through partnerships that extend our bbq sauces  seasonings and prepared entrees in retail outlets across the united states 
trademarks we have received various trademarks and have applied for registration of additional service marks and intend to defend these marks 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be granted trademark registration for pending applications or any or all of the proposed uses in our applications 
in the event our additional mark s are granted registration  there can be no assurance that we can protect such mark s and design s against prior users in areas where we conduct operations 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to prevent competitors from using the same or similar marks  concepts or appearance 
competition competition in the restaurant industry is intense 
famous dave s restaurants compete with moderately priced casual dining restaurants primarily on the basis of quality of food and service  atmosphere  location and value 
in addition to existing themed and barbecue restaurants  we expect to face competition from steakhouses and other restaurants featuring large portions of red meat 
we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for quality sites 
competition in the food service industry is affected by changes in consumer taste  economic and real estate conditions  demographic trends  traffic patterns  the cost and availability of qualified labor  product availability and local competitive factors 
many of our competitors are well established and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than famous dave s 
regional and national restaurant companies continue to expand their operations in our current and anticipated market areas 
we believe our ability to compete effectively depends on our ongoing ability to offer high quality  competitively priced food in a distinctive and comfortable environment 
government regulation we are subject to extensive state and local government regulation by various governmental agencies  including state and local licensing  zoning  land use  construction and environmental regulations and various regulations relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages  sanitation  disposal of refuse and waste products  public health  safety and fire standards 
our restaurants are subject to periodic inspections by governmental agencies to ensure conformity with such regulations 
any difficulty or failure to obtain required licensing or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant  and the suspension of  or inability to renew  a license could interrupt operations at an existing restaurant  any of which would adversely affect our operations 
restaurant operating costs are also affected by other government actions that are beyond our control  including increases in the minimum hourly wage requirements  workers compensation insurance rates  health care insurance costs and unemployment and other taxes 
we are also subject to dram shop statutes  which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated persons 
to the extent that famous dave s offers and sells franchises  we are also subject to federal regulation and certain state laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises 
many state franchise laws impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements  including limitations on non competition provisions and the termination or non renewal of a franchise 
bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of substantive aspects of the franchiser franchisee relationship 
as proposed  such legislation would limit  among other things  the duration and scope of non competition provisions  the ability of a franchiser to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise  and the ability of a franchiser to designate sources of supply 
the federal americans with disabilities act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment 
we could be required to expend funds to modify our restaurants in order to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
our restaurants are currently designed to be accessible to the disabled 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled 
employees as of december   famous dave s had approximately  employees  of which approximately were full time 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
management believes that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory

since inception and through fiscal  the development cost of existing shack or lodge restaurants has ranged from approximately  to  per restaurant for conversions ranging in size from  square feet to  square feet  and from  to  per restaurant for new construction ranging in size from  square feet to  square feet 
such development cost includes construction  fixtures  furniture and equipment  and pre opening costs  but does not include the cost of purchased land as it has been our general practice to lease the majority of our sites 
the development cost of the existing  square foot blues club in minneapolis was approximately million  including pre opening expenses of approximately  development of the chicago blues club cost an estimated million including approximately  for pre opening expense 
there can be no assurances that units planned for and later will open when planned  or at all  due to the risks associated with the development of new units  such as governmental approvals and the availability of capital  many of which are beyond our control

as of december   we owned and operated thirty three restaurants fourteen in minnesota  five in illinois  three each in wisconsin  iowa and maryland  two each in utah and virginia and one in nebraska 
in addition to these thirty three restaurants  we have two additional units in development in the chicago area and nine restaurants operating in minnesota  illinois and wisconsin under franchise agreements 
our future additional revenues and profits will depend upon various factors  including additional market acceptance of the famous dave s concept  the quality of the restaurant operations  the ability to successfully expand into new markets  our ability to raise additional financing as required and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance we will successfully implement our expansion plans  in which case we will continue to be dependent on revenues from existing operations 
we also face all of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the development of an expanding business 
furthermore  to the extent that our expansion strategy is successful  we must manage the transition to multiple site and higher volume operations  the control of overhead expenses and the addition and retention of necessary personnel 
components of operating expenses include operating payroll and employee benefits  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  and advertising and promotion 
certain of these costs are variable and will increase with sales volume 
the primary fixed costs are corporate and restaurant management and occupancy costs 
our experience is that when a new restaurant opens  it incurs higher than normal levels of labor and food costs until operations stabilize  usually during the first three months of operation 
as restaurant management and staff gain experience following the opening  labor scheduling  food cost management and operating expense control are improved to levels similar to those at our more established restaurants 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that serve to support existing operations and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
management  supervisory and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  rent  depreciation  general insurance and marketing expenses are major items in this category 
as of january   we elected a or week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest december before january   we used a fiscal year ending on december fiscal year was a week year  while fiscal years and were both week years 
we were formed in march and opened our first restaurant in minneapolis in june through december   we operated a total of thirty three restaurants and franchised nine locations 
operating results overall results of operations for the weeks ended december  reflect the opening of eleven new units during fiscal our overall operating results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  expressed as a percentage of net revenue  were as follows fiscal years ended december  january  january  revenue  net unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs labor and benefits operating expenses depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses total costs and expenses income from unit level operations general and administrative expenses impairment reserve on restaurants and other assets income loss from operations interest and other income expense gain on sale of property cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss a breakdown of our restaurant restaurant  ribfest and retail operations operating results are as follows amounts in s for fiscal year ending restaurant operations total company of net of net amount revenue amount revenue revenue  net   unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs   labor and benefits   operating expenses   depreciation and amortization   pre opening expenses total costs and expenses   income from unit level operations   for fiscal year ending restaurant operations total company of net of net amount revenue amount revenue revenue  net   unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs   labor and benefits   operating expenses   depreciation and amortization   pre opening expenses total costs and expenses   income from unit level operations  for fiscal year ending restaurant operations total company of net of net amount revenue amount revenue revenue  net   unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs   labor and benefits   operating expenses   depreciation and amortization   pre opening expenses  total costs and expenses   income from unit level operations   fiscal year compared to fiscal year net restaurant revenue net restaurant revenue increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended january  the increase in revenue was due primarily to an additional eleven restaurants opened and acquired during fiscal  adding to the base of twenty four restaurants open as of january  approximately million of the increase  the contribution of a full year of revenue from restaurants which were open for only part of approximately million of the increase and an increase in revenue from restaurants open for all of both periods approximately million  offset by a decline in revenue from two existing restaurants that were franchised in fiscal approximately million and the sale of the retail line of business in june approximately million 
because of the fiscal restaurant openings  and expected additional restaurant openings in  we anticipate net revenue and operating costs and expenses to continue to increase during fiscal during fiscal  we increased menu prices an average of 
other revenue other revenue for the company consists of royalty revenues and franchise fees 
franchise revenues for fiscal were  compares to  for the same period in franchise revenue includes both franchise royalty income and franchise fees 
royalties are based on a percent of sales  while fee amounts reflect initial non refundable fixed fees and are recorded as revenue when an agreement is signed and no additional material services are required by the company 
the company currently has nine franchises open compared to two for the same period in during the second quarter  the company sold its sauce and seasoning retail line of business and now receives licensing royalty income 
for fiscal year  the licensing royalty income was  same store sales it is our policy to include in our same store sales base restaurants that have been open more than eighteen months 
during fiscal  there were twenty one restaurants included in this base 
same store sales for fiscal increased approximately compared to fiscal s increase of approximately 
management believes that the increase in comparable sales is a result of continued improvements in customer satisfaction and favorable economic trends 
average weekly sales average weekly sales from restaurant operations increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal restaurant operating weeks during fiscal totaled  compared to  in fiscal the increase in average weekly volume is due to the increase in comparable restaurant sales combined with the successful opening of new  higher volume restaurants 
food and beverage costs food and beverage costs for fiscal were  or of net restaurant revenue compared to  or for fiscal the decrease in food and beverage costs as a percent of net restaurant revenue was primarily due to an increase in higher margin liquor sales and increased cost controls 
labor and benefits labor and benefits were  or of net restaurant revenue in fiscal compared to  or of net revenue in fiscal the increase in labor and benefits both in amount and as a percent of net restaurant revenue was primarily attributable to the opening of eleven new restaurants with full service as well as a heightened emphasis on training and execution in our restaurants 
additionally  prior year revenue included the retail sauce and seasoning division against which there was minimal labor charges 
full service restaurants that operate in states without a tip credit such as minnesota experience a higher wage rate for dining room labor than do restaurants located in states where a tip credit is available to reduce wages paid to foodservers 
the migration toward full service dining in most of our restaurants is part of our strategy for increasing unit level revenue  but does result in higher labor costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal were  or of net restaurant revenue compared to  or of net restaurant revenue for fiscal the dollar increase in operating expenses is related to the increased number of restaurants 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of net restaurant revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to continued emphasis placed on cost reduction efforts as well as the impact of fixed costs against a higher average volume 
depreciation and amortization unit level depreciation and amortization for fiscal was  or of net restaurant revenue compared to  or of net restaurant revenue for fiscal the decrease in unit level depreciation and amortization as a percent of net restaurant revenue is due primarily to increased revenue from both new and existing restaurants in fiscal the increased dollar amount of depreciation expense is the result of increased construction costs of new units opened in fiscal and a full year s depreciation from locations open only part of fiscal income from unit level operations income from unit level operations totaled  or of net operating revenue for fiscal compared to  or of net operating revenue for fiscal income from unit level operations represents income from operations before general and administrative expenses 
although income from unit level operations should not be considered an alternative to income loss from operations as a measure of our operating performance  such unit level measurement is commonly used as an additional measure of operating performance in the restaurant industry and certain related industries 
the change in income from unit level operations from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in net revenue both from existing units and additional units opened and an increase in royalty income and franchise fees 
other changes in costs and expenses discussed above also contributed to the change in income from unit level operations 
pre opening expenses pre opening expenses were  or of net revenue for fiscal compared to  or of net revenue for fiscal these expenses reflect the opening and conversion of eleven new restaurants in fiscal compared to two new restaurants in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled  or of net operating revenue in fiscal compared to  or of net operating revenue in fiscal included in the amount is  associated with severance and restructuring charges taken in the fourth quarter of the dollar increase reflects an increase in the corporate infrastructure to support recent growth

the increase in net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal is due to increased income from restaurant and franchise operations  an emphasis on controlled expenses and no requirement for an impairment reserve  but is offset by an increase in the number of shares outstanding 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net restaurant revenue net restaurant revenue increased by  or to  for the year ended january  from  for the year ended january  the increase in revenue was due primarily to an additional two restaurants opened during fiscal  adding to the base of twenty two restaurants open as of january  approximately million of the increase  the contribution of a full year of revenue from restaurants which were open for only part of approximately million of the increase and an increase in non restaurant revenues approximately  of the increase offset by a decline in revenue from restaurants open for all of both periods approximately  and the lost revenue from two restaurants closed in approximately 
because of the fiscal restaurant openings  and expected additional restaurant openings in fiscal  we anticipate net revenue and operating costs and expenses to continue to increase during fiscal we had no material menu price increases during fiscal same store sales it is our policy to include in our same store sales base restaurants that have been open more than eighteen months 
during fiscal  there were nineteen restaurants included in this base 
same store sales for fiscal increased approximately compared to fiscal s decrease of approximately 
management is encouraged by the increases as sales were largely unaided by media advertising 
average weekly sales average weekly sales from restaurant operations decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal restaurant operating weeks during fiscal totaled  compared to  in fiscal average weekly sales at units opened outside of the minneapolis st 
paul market have generally been higher than sales at units within the minneapolis st 
paul area which management finds encouraging as it expands into new markets 
food and beverage costs food and beverage costs for fiscal were  or of net revenue compared to  or for fiscal the decrease in food and beverage costs as a percent of net revenue was primarily due to improved purchasing economies including contract pricing of certain pork items and an increase in liquor sales  partially offset by costs associated with increased sales of lower margin retail grocery items 
labor and benefits labor and benefits were  or of net revenue in fiscal compared to  or of net revenue in fiscal the increase in labor and benefits as a percent of net revenue was primarily attributable to the introduction of full table service in several restaurants that were formerly counter service shacks as well as a heightened emphasis on training and execution in our restaurants 
full service restaurants that operate in states without a tip credit such as minnesota experience a higher wage rate for dining room labor than do restaurants located in states where a tip credit is available to reduce wages paid to foodservers 
the migration toward full service dining in most of our restaurants is part of our strategy for increasing unit level revenue  but does result in higher labor costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal were  or of net revenue compared to  or of net revenue for fiscal the increase in operating expenses both in amount and as a percent of net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to increases in fixed expenses such as rent and real estate taxes  the marketing expenses allocated to the restaurants and other operating costs  such as entertainment expenses at the blues clubs 
depreciation and amortization unit level depreciation and amortization for fiscal was  or of net revenue compared to  or of net revenue for fiscal the increase in unit level depreciation and amortization as a percent of net revenue is due primarily to higher depreciation expense resulting from increased construction costs of new units opened in fiscal including the chicago blues club and a full year s depreciation from locations open only part of fiscal income from unit level operations income from unit level operations totaled  or of net revenue for fiscal compared to  or of net revenue for fiscal income from unit level operations represents income from operations before general and administrative expenses 
although income from unit level operations should not be considered an alternative to income loss from operations as a measure of our operating performance  such unit level measurement is commonly used as an additional measure of operating performance in the restaurant industry and certain related industries 
the change in income from unit level operations  in amount from to is primarily attributable to the increase in net revenue both from existing units and additional units opened 
other changes in costs and expenses discussed above also contributed to the change in income from unit level operations 
pre opening expenses pre opening expenses were  or of net revenue for fiscal compared to  or of net revenue for fiscal these expenses reflect the opening of two new restaurants in fiscal compared to the opening of ten new restaurants in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to  or of net revenue in fiscal from  or of net revenue in fiscal included in the amount is  associated with severance and restructuring charges taken in the fourth quarter  compared to the amount which includes  for severance and restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of that year 
without these charges  general and administrative expense would still have been significantly less  or in fiscal than in the preceding year 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue reflects increased revenue and the adjustment of our corporate infrastructure to a reduced level which management believes is appropriate to support current  more controlled plans for expansion 
loss from operations loss from operations totaled  or of net revenue for fiscal compared to  or of net revenue for fiscal the loss from operations in reflects approximately million in expenses associated with impairment charges on certain restaurants  severance payments and other miscellaneous expenses taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal this compares to the loss from operations in fiscal which included approximately million in expenses associated with a provision for disposition of two restaurants and severance and restructuring charges taken in the first quarter of excluding these special provisions  the comparable loss from operations for fiscal is  or compared to a loss of  or for fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  which primarily represents interest income from short term investments and franchise income offset by interest expense on capital lease obligations and notes payable  totaled  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the reduced level of short term investments in and an increase in interest expense on a sale leaseback transaction and a line of credit 
net loss net loss per share net loss for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal basic and diluted net loss per common share was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in the net loss in compared to is due to the accounting charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal for impairment charges on certain restaurants  severance payments and other miscellaneous expenses 
exclusive of the accounting charges taken in fiscal and fiscal  the comparable loss would have been  or for fiscal and  or for fiscal financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we held cash of approximately million compared to million as of january  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  this increase in cash during the fifty two weeks ended december  reflects additional earnings  cash from financing activities and the use of cash for the purchase and or development of property  equipment and leasehold improvements approximately million 
at december   we were a party to a credit agreement with a bank which provided approximately million of borrowing capability to us  of which approximately  was outstanding at year end 
this agreement is secured by substantially all of our property  and in addition is guaranteed by and secured by certain of the assets of our chairman  david anderson 
for fiscal year  the credit agreement carries an interest rate of above the prime rate  and provides for borrowing up to a maximum of of the value of a collateral pool which consists of our property and certain of the property pledged to secure the credit agreement by mr 
anderson 
total availability on this agreement as of december  was  due to collateral limits 
the credit agreement matures in april during fiscal  we secured a commitment for million in financing for restaurant equipment  software  and signage 
as of december   none of this financing had been utilized 
on march  we closed on a sale leaseback financing transaction that provided net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december  we have mortgage financings secured by land and buildings that provided proceeds of approximately million for continued development of company owned restaurants 
to continue our expansion  we anticipate that additional financing will be required during fiscal we anticipate that future development and expansion will be funded or financed primarily through cash and short term investments currently held  proceeds from the sale of additional equity and or debt securities  and proceeds from other forms of financing such as lease financing or other credit facilities 
however  there are no assurances that additional financing required for expansion will be available on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
income taxes at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nol s for tax reporting purposes of approximately million  which if not used will begin to expire in and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which  if not used  will begin to expire in future changes in ownership  if any  may place limitations on the use of these nol s 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol s due to the uncertainty of realizing the related benefit 
quarterly fluctuations  seasonality and inflation our restaurants typically generate higher revenues in the second and third quarters and lower revenues in the first and fourth quarters as a result of seasonal traffic increases experienced during the summer months  and possible adverse weather which can disrupt customer and employee transportation to our restaurants 
the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
in addition  our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs and utilities and these costs are subject to inflationary increases 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate changes based on market conditions 
we believe low inflation rates have contributed to relatively stable costs 
there is no assurance  however  that low inflation rates will continue 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and long term debt 
the company includes as cash and cash equivalents certificates of deposits and all other investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
the total outstanding long term debt of the company as of december  was  the company s long term debt is not subject to interest rate risk because all of the company s long term debt has fixed rates of interest 
the company does not enter into contracts for speculative or investment purposes 
the company s primary exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates involves the company s revolving line of credit with associated commercial finance  inc f k a bnc financial corporation 
advances on this line of credit are due on demand and accrue interest at the prime rate plus  payable monthly 
therefore  an increase or decrease in interest rates and specifically the prime rate will cause a corresponding increase or decrease in interest expenses associated with this line of credit 
as of december   this line of credit had maximum borrowings of approximately  of which approximately  was outstanding as of such date 
based on the applicable reference rate on december  and assuming all other factors remain constant  interest expense for a twelve month period would be approximately  a reference rate increase of basis points would result in an increase in interest expense of  a point decrease in the reference rate would result in a decrease of  in interest expense over the same twelve month period
