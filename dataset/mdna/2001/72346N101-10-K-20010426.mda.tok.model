item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and the discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the statements regarding the wireless communications industry  our expectations regarding our future performance and other non historical statements in this discussion are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in business forward looking statements and associated considerations 
the company we restated our audited financial statements for the year ended december   and our unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended march   june   and september  and  to expense certain costs previously capitalized as direct costs of the motorola antenna site acquisition and to accrue direct costs of the motorola antenna site acquisition only as the related services are performed 
direct costs incurred in connection with a purchased business are required to be capitalized and indirect costs are required to be expensed 
determining under available accounting guidance which costs or portions thereof are direct  as opposed to indirect  requires the exercise of a certain amount of judgment 
upon completion of the motorola antenna site acquisition  we determined to capitalize all pre and post closing costs directly related to the acquisition 
following an inquiry by the sec and  after consulting with our new independent auditors  e y  we reconsidered our previous accounting judgment and concluded it was appropriate to capitalize all costs that relate directly to the acquisition except those post closing costs that are deemed to more than incidentally reduce our need to incur ongoing business expenses necessary to integrate those assets into our operations 
additionally  we had previously  at the date of the acquisition  accrued estimated direct costs of acquisitions regardless of whether the costs had been incurred as of that date 
we have now concluded that such costs should be accrued as the services are incurred 
for the year ended december   the restatement reduced total assets by million  stockholders equity by million  increased net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss attributable to common stockholders per share by 
million and  respectively 
all references to amounts are to the amounts as restated 
overview we acquire communications sites and construct rental towers and lease space on these communications sites to a broad base of wireless communications providers  operators of private networks  government agencies and other customers 
our objective is to acquire or construct clusters of rental communications sites in areas where there is significant existing and expected continued growth in the demand for rental communications sites by wireless communications providers 
we seek to obtain a significant ownership position of communications site assets in our targeted markets in order to offer one stop shopping to wireless communications providers who are deploying or expanding wireless communications networks 
since our formation in may  we have focused on creating a portfolio of wireless communications site clusters in high growth markets such as atlanta  birmingham  boston  chicago  dallas  houston  los angeles  new orleans  new york  orlando and tampa 
as of december   we have acquired carrier neutral colocation facilities located in texas  and st 
louis  missouri for an aggregate purchase price of million 
colocation facilities are buildings that provide telecommunications service providers  such as incumbent local exchange carriers  competitive local exchange carriers  fiber optic network carriers  internet backbone providers  application service providers  and internet data centers  square footage space to house their equipment ie switches  servers  routers and access to an interexchange carrier typically known as long distance carriers 
independently owned carrier neutral colocation facilities provide interconnectivity to multiple communications carriers versus carrier owned facilities that offer interconnectivity to just their own network 
though we believe carrier neutral colocation facilities are characterized by high growth driven by continuing demand for voice  data and internet services and can provide a stable and recurring cash flow from a diversified customer base  on august  we announced our intent not to pursue additional colocation facility opportunities  due to  among other things  our limited ability to currently access additional capital discussed elsewhere herein 
after further analysis we have decided not to pursue other colocation facility business opportunities and we are currently considering our options with respect to the facilities we purchased 
such options include continuing to operate the facilities  selling such assets outright  or transferring the properties and contracts to a new entity that would have other equity holders in consideration for debt  equity  cash or a combination thereof 
the table below outlines the number of acquisitions we have completed and the corresponding wireless communication sites and carrier neutral colocation facilities as of december  non revenue producing sites are those sites acquired as part of a larger  more profitable acquisition of sites  that are not generating revenue 
no value is assigned to non revenue producing sites 
the table includes a reclassification of sites to reflect a new category of non revenue producing sites and to classify sites based on findings pursuant to due diligence efforts on acquired sites previously reported revenue producing sites non revenue acquisitions owned managed leased built colocation subtotal sites total completed subtotal     reclass since december   we have completed four acquisitions of five communications sites and one previously leased land site under an owned tower  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in addition  as of and subsequent to december   we entered into one letter of intent to purchase one communication site that we currently believe is probable to close  reflecting an aggregate commitment to pay approximately 
million 
this probable acquisition is subject to conditions of a closing and consummation of a transaction pending completion of due diligence efforts and any further negotiation that may result therefrom 
we have identified additional potential acquisition sites that we are not currently actively pursuing because of our limited ability to currently access capital discussed elsewhere in this report 
however  should we become able to access additional capital on reasonable terms  we would likely resume efforts to evaluate acquiring those and other sites 
the reclass resulted primarily from further clarification as to the nature of ownership rights in sites and reclassification of non revenue producing sites 
we believe that significant opportunities for growth exist by maximizing the use of our existing and future communications sites 
because the costs of operating a communications site are primarily fixed on owned sites  increasing tower utilization significantly improves tower level operating margins on these sites 
we believe that same site revenue growth on owned communications sites is a meaningful indicator of the quality of these sites and our ability to generate incremental revenue on such sites 
it is measured by comparing the run rate revenue of our owned communications sites at the end of a period to the run rate revenue for the same owned communications sites at the end of the prior period 
same site growth is a result of expanded marketing efforts to increase the number of customers per site  renegotiating leases that are subject to renewal  and contractual price escalations for existing customers 
taking into consideration new leases written as of december   we experienced same site revenue growth of approximately for the year ended december  on the base of communications sites we owned as of december  for the twelve month period ended december   we experienced same site revenue growth on those communications sites in our portfolio as of december  at the following rates owned all sites sites gross new revenues net of cancellations owned sites as depicted in this table are those where we own either the land  the tower or both on a tower site  or have a permanent easement on a rooftop 
this would contrast to other sites in our portfolio where we have i contractual rights to manage towers or rooftops  either exclusively or non exclusively  ii have a non permanent easement right on a rooftop site  or  iii lease a space on a tower owned by another tower owner for the purpose of sub leasing to one of our tenants who needed space on a site in an area where we had no site inventory in existence 
the new revenue rates remain strong compared to our results  especially when taking into consideration a significantly larger base of sites and revenues as of december  compared to december  we have experienced strong new lease activity with respect to our telephony customers  which includes pcs  cellular and digital smr specialized mobile radio 
in addition  we experienced rapid growth in our new business from the new technology market segments  which include data  lmds  wireless internet  satellite radio and location customers  during the twelve month period ended december  we expect that strong new lease activity with respect to our telephony customers will continue as they continue their aggressive build outs  and we also look for our new technology customers to provide increasingly more significant contributions to our revenues as they become a larger part of our overall business 
these new technology customers are attracted to our communication sites because they deploy at higher elevations and our portfolio of sites accommodate these elevations 
the net of cancellations rates above reflect churn at rates significantly greater than those that we have previously experienced 
these greater churn rates result primarily from one customer s deconstruction of its analog smr network and the effects of certain private land mobile tenants shifting to utilizing one of the many commercial wireless services now available 
we have substantially less exposure now to churn related to deconstruction of analog sites and we expect that the churn from the smaller land mobile tenants will level out soon and that churn from paging customers will remain relatively stable 
in addition to the tenant lease churn we have discussed above  we are also experiencing a level of pressure on our revenue base from competitors for the rooftop management business 
as these contracts come up for renewal with the property owners  we are experiencing instances where certain other companies  who compete with us for the right to manage these rooftops  are offering to manage these sites for a significantly lower gross margin after rent expense only than we feel it is appropriate for us to compete with 
our strategy is to own and manage sites where we can make substantial operating margins  as indicated by our results of operations  and we do not desire to dilute our operating margins for the sake of competing against companies aggressively pricing this service to rooftop owners 
therefore  we have made decisions to not renew a number of these contracts over the past year 
as a result  our revenue base has been impacted as of december  as compared to december  by approximately million on an annualized run rate basis by these decisions 
the historical gross margins before depreciation and amortization on these sites have typically averaged 
to compete with these competitors offering this service at a gross margin after rent expense is clearly not consistent with both our operating and growth strategies 
as of december   we operated rooftop sites under management rights agreements  which represented of our total portfolio of revenue producing sites at that date 
our annualized run rate revenues from these sites as of december  was million  or of total annualized run rate revenues from all sites as of december  run rate gross margin  estimated based on historical results for the twelve months ended december   on these sites average  so these sites represent of our total run rate gross margins as of december  in light of these recent competitive pressures  it is difficult to ascertain at this time the effects  if any  this competition will have on our revenues from rooftops we manage under management rights agreements and resulting gross margins before depreciation and amortization in the future 
we have generated net losses since inception and at december   had an accumulated deficit totaling approximately million 
due to our plans to continue to grow the business predominantly through acquisitions  it is expected that charges relating to depreciation of existing and future assets and interest expense associated with related debt balances will be substantial 
also  this growth through acquisitions will continue to result in significant corporate development expenses 
accordingly  we expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future 
our annualized run rate revenue is calculated as of a given date by annualizing the monthly rental rates then in effect for customer lease contracts as of such date 
we believe that growth in our annualized run rate revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance 
as of december   our annualized run rate revenue was approximately million 
on august   we completed the motorola antenna site acquisition and acquired approximately  communications sites from motorola consisting of approximately owned sites  managed sites and leased sites  for million in cash and stock  plus fees and expenses 
we have never completed a transaction as large as the motorola antenna site acquisition 
due to the magnitude  timing  logistical and other constraints of the motorola antenna site acquisition  we were unable prior to closing the transaction to access  analyze and verify all information needed to ascertain the physical inventory and condition of the assets acquired including through engineering surveys of the assets  estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for purposes of purchase price allocation in our financial statements  identify  evaluate and record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for purposes of determining the final purchase price  and properly evaluate all record title and mortgage documents for acquired real estate assets 
the total of our motorola antenna site acquisition pre and post closing transaction related due diligence and related efforts cost approximately million  approximately million of which was incurred post closing 
such efforts have not revealed any unanticipated information regarding matters that would have a material adverse effect on our operations and liquidity 
motorola s representations and warranties in the definitive purchase agreement between us and motorola the motorola purchase agreement did not survive the closing of the acquisition 
therefore  our ability to obtain compensation from motorola for defects in title  the need for third party consents and the need to make payments to obtain such consents or other site related and other unanticipated issues is limited 
we may be able to seek redress under certain other provisions of the motorola purchase agreement  including through the purchase price adjustment based on changes in working capital and the covenant requiring motorola to provide further assurances as needed to convey the acquired assets 
the nature and magnitude of these issues will not be fully determined until our post closing investigation is substantially completed  but the issues could have a impact on our operations and liquidity  which impact could be significant 
while we have substantially completed our post closing investigation  the future discovery of such issues could have an impact on our operations and liquidity  which impact could be significant 
for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis  the motorola sites generated million in revenue  million in tower level cash flow and million in ebitda for the eight months ended prior to closing on august  prior to the motorola antenna site acquisition we did not have a significant number of managed or leased sites in our portfolio 
generally  managed and leased sites have higher operating costs than owned towers  primarily as a result of higher rental costs related to revenue sharing with site owners 
in addition  on leased sites  we generally have a right to lease only a limited portion of a site  which limits total revenue potential 
higher relative operating costs and limited revenue growth results in substantially lower tower cash flow and ebitda margin performance on managed and leased sites 
accordingly  the acquisition of managed and leased sites in the motorola antenna site acquisition or any potential future acquisitions will substantially decrease our site level operating margins 
following the closing of the motorola antenna site acquisition we transferred a portion of the rooftop communication sites we acquired from motorola to pt iii  a corporation in which we own substantially all of the equity interests  in exchange for million of nonvoting convertible preferred stock and a million convertible promissory note  in order to minimize the risk that the ownership of or income from such assets might negatively affect our qualification as a reit 
we also agreed to make our personnel  facilities and general and administrative overhead available to pt iii  and ptiii agreed to reimburse us for our costs incurred in doing so 
during  we purchased approximately million of additional nonvoting convertible preferred stock of pt iii and approximately million of additional convertible promissory notes 
pt iii used such funds to acquire all of the stock of two corporations which own and manage communications sites  and to acquire certain assets used in communications site management and related activities 
substantially all of the income derived from the activities described in the preceding sentence constitute income which is non reit qualifying 
the assets and liabilities and results of operations of pt iii are included with those of pinnacle towers inc in the consolidated financial statements 
during  we invested funds in ptiv  which used the funds to acquire all of the stock of another corporation engaged in the management of rooftop communication sites on behalf of third party property owners  which constitutes an activity the income from which is non reit qualifying 
in return for our total investment of approximately million in ptiv  we received a million ptiv convertible promissory note  million of ptiv nonvoting convertible preferred stock and approximately of the outstanding voting common stock of ptiv 
certain of our officers own the remaining outstanding voting common stock of ptiv 
the terms of the convertible promissory notes and nonvoting convertible preferred stock of ptiv are the same as the terms of the convertible notes and nonvoting convertible preferred stock of ptiii described above 
we also agreed to make our personnel  facilities  and general and administrative overhead available to ptiv  and ptiv agreed to reimburse us for our costs incurred in doing so 
on july   the internal revenue service issued a private letter ruling to ptiii confirming that the ownership of  and receipt of income from  its rooftop sites and related equipment will be considered qualifying assets and income for reit purposes 
although ptiii had initially planned to make its own reit election provided that the internal revenue service ruled favorably with respect to such assets and income  ptiii did not elect to be taxed as a reit for the short period year of and will not do so for the calendar year because the non reit income received by ptiii as a result of the acquisitions of non reit qualifying assets which it made during prevent ptiii from satisfying certain of the gross income requirements for reit qualification 
we have taken several actions during to restructure our investments in ptiii and ptiv in order to comply with changes in the reit tax law which became effective on january  such restructuring will also permit the reit qualifying assets and income of ptiii  which were the subject of ptiii s favorable july  ruling of the internal revenue service  to fall under our reit election 
ptiii transferred substantially all of its non reit qualifying assets to pinnacle towers v inc ptv  a wholly owned subsidiary of ptiii 
thereafter  we acquired all of the ptiii voting common stock owned by certain officers of pinnacle  upon which ptiii  as a wholly owned subsidiary  became a qualified reit subsidiary of ours 
as a qualified reit subsidiary  the assets and income of ptiii will be considered as ours and covered by our reit election on and after the date on which ptiii became wholly owned by us 
we and ptv jointly elected to treat ptv as a taxable reit subsidiary 
we and ptiv jointly elected to treat ptiv as a taxable reit subsidiary 
after the making of the taxable reit subsidiary election for ptiv  we acquired all of the outstanding voting common stock of ptiv owned by certain of its officers  thereby making ptiv a wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary of ours 
during  we made limited investments in a subsidiary we formed to do business in the united kingdom 
as of december  we owned approximately a interest in that subsidiary 
the business of this subsidiary is the acquisition and operation of communications tower sites 
in some cases  the sites have towers located on them  and in other cases we expect to construct towers on the sites we have acquired 
as of december   we have invested a total of million in this subsidiary 
we do not expect that this business will become a significant part of our overall business operations 
currently  we expect that our investment in this business will be limited to less than  we have recently had discussions with third parties concerning their potential investment in this business 
such an investment could result in our retaining a minority interest in that subsidiary and no longer controlling it 
the results of operations are reported on a consolidated basis with the minority interest disclosed 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  each statement of operations item as a percentage of total site rental revenue 
the results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
years ended december  statement of operations data revenue operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization expenses general and administrative corporate development state franchise  excise and minimum taxes depreciation loss from operations interest expense amortization of original issue discount loss before income taxes and extraordinary items year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this additional revenue is mainly attributable to the acquisition and construction of sites during the fourth quarter  sites during third quarter of  and sites during the first two quarters of also  the results included only four months of revenue from the motorola antenna site acquisition versus twelve months in the year ended december  a final portion of the revenue increase is related to same site growth 
direct operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the acquisition and construction of the sites discussed above 
also  the results included only four months of operating expenses from the motorola antenna site acquisition versus twelve months in the year ended december  direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the percentage increase is primarily a result of the change in mix of sites 
both managed and leased sites produce lower margins than owned sites because of their variable rent expense 
notwithstanding  many of these sites are financially and strategically consistent with our objective of providing wireless service providers a large selection of antenna site locations 
general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses is from additional staffing required for the increased work volume  increased levels of advertising and marketing expenditures  costs associated with growth  as well as significant non recurring charges in the third and fourth quarters totaling million 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is the result of non recurring charges in the third and fourth quarters totaling million 
these non recurring charges are associated with an equity offering discontinued during the quarter million and costs incurred as a result of the sec investigation million 
corporate development expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  corporate development expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in expense is related to the overall growth in the business and related activity during this same period as well as significant  non recurring charges in the third and fourth quarter totaling million 
these non recurring charges are comprised of non cash charges related to the impairment of capitalized costs on pending acquisitions million and communications site construction project million tower assets which the company has chosen not to pursue at this time 
additionally  we expensed approximately million for professional fees in for assistance with acquisition related projects  versus approximately million in state franchise  excise and minimum taxes  which represent taxes assessed in connection with our operations in various state jurisdictions  increased to million for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  such taxes are calculated using various methods such as a portion of our property within a given state  our capital structure or based upon a minimum tax in lieu of income taxes 
interest expense  net of amortization of original issue discount  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was attributable to increased senior borrowings outstanding associated with our acquisitions activity  partially offset by some favorable interest rate protection agreements affecting the year ended december   plus the interest on our convertible notes issued march  the weighted average balance of senior debt outstanding increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance cost increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from increased amortization of original issue discount of million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of million  million attributable to the issuance costs for the september  amendment to our senior credit facility and million attributable to the issuance costs for our convertible notes issued march  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this additional revenue is mainly attributable to the acquisition and construction of  sites since january  they are as follows sites during the fourth quarter   sites during third quarter   sites during first two quarters of  and sites during a portion of the revenue increase is related to same sites growth 
same site growth is a result of expanded marketing efforts to increase the number of customers per site  renegotiating leases that are subject to renewal  and  contractual price escalations for existing customers 
direct operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the acquisition and construction of the  sites discussed above 
direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the percentage increase is primarily a result of the change in mix of sites 
both managed and leased sites produce lower margins than owned sites because of their variable rent expense 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increases in expenses are from additional staffing required for the increased work volume  our becoming a public registrant  increased levels of advertising and marketing expenditures  and other related costs associated with our growth 
however  as a percentage of revenue  it decreased to of revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  reflecting the disproportionate higher growth in revenues relative to expenses 
the decrease in percentage is from economies of scale realized from increases in tower revenues as a result of our acquisitions and construction of communications sites 
corporate development expenses increased million  but decreased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in expense is related to the overall growth in the business and related activity during this same period 
the decrease in percentage is from economies of scale realized from increases in tower revenues relative to direct operating expenses as a result of the company s acquisitions and construction of communications sites 
additionally  we expensed approximately million for professional fees in for assistance with acquisition related projects 
state franchise  excise and minimum taxes  which represent taxes assessed in connection with our operations in various state jurisdictions  increased to million in from million in such taxes are calculated using various methods such as a portion of our property within a given state  our capital structure or based upon a minimum tax in lieu of income taxes 
the increase in is primarily attributable to the significant expansion of our geographic region primarily through acquisitions 
interest expense  net of amortization of original issue discount  increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense was attributable to increased borrowing associated with our acquisitions and construction activity during the period 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise from our acquisition related activities  debt service obligations  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we have historically funded our liquidity needs with proceeds from equity contributions  public equity offerings  bank borrowings  a debt offering  and cash flow from operations 
we had net working capital of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our ratio of total debt to stockholders equity was to at december  and to at december  senior credit facility our senior credit facility provides us with a million revolving line of credit  with an uncommitted increase option  which could increase the revolving line of credit to million  a million term loan and a million term loan  for a total availability of up to million  of which million including letters of credit is currently committed the senior credit facility 
under our revolving line of credit  we may make borrowings and repayments until june  under one term loan  advances must be repaid in full by june  in addition  after june  scheduled quarterly reductions in the commitment amount begin and continue through june   at which time the commitment will be reduced to zero 
based on commitment and availability levels as of december  we anticipate that the initial payments on the revolving line of credit will be required during quarterly principal payments on the term loans begin september  accordingly  the portion of this debt due within the next twelve months has been classified as short term 
outstanding balances under the million and million term loans  million as of december   are scheduled to be paid in full by june  and  respectively 
advances under our senior credit facility have been used primarily to fund acquisitions and construction of sites 
as of december  we had million available under our senior credit facility  after giving effect to approximately million of outstanding letters of credit  which reduced availability under our senior credit facility 
effective april   the senior credit facility requires that of certain annual excess cash flows as defined by the senior credit facility agreement be used to pay down balances outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
for the fiscal quarter ended december   the company was not in compliance with two financial ratio covenants under its bank loan agreement 
in april of  the company obtained a waiver with respect to covenant breaches so long as actual ratios met the amended requirements 
the following table summarizes the initial covenant requirements and the amended requirements for the period ended december  and the company s actual ratios at the respective dates amended covenant original requirement actual requirement leverage ratio to to to pro forma debt service coverage ratio to to to the amendment also adjusted the interest rates charged on the loan based on the quarterly leverage ratio calculations for periods subsequent to the date of the waiver 
the amendment did not adjust the above ratio requirements for future measurement dates 
the above ratio requirements for the next measurement date fiscal quarter ended march  are to and to for the leverage and pro forma debt service coverage ratios  respectively 
based upon the company s projections for  management believes that the company will be in compliance with its financial covenants during the next year 
senior discount notes in march  we completed the offering of the senior discount notes 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from that offering 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility  to repay in full and retire a million bridge loan from abry ii and accrued interest thereon and a million subordinated term loan and accrued interest thereon and to pay a distribution preference to certain holders of our common stock 
the senior discount notes were issued under the senior discount notes indenture and will mature on march  cash interest is not payable on the senior discount notes prior to march  thereafter  the senior discount notes will require semi annual cash interest payments of million 
convertible notes on march  we completed a private placement of million of the convertible notes to certain institutional purchasers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
we repaid outstanding revolving debt under our senior credit facility with the net proceeds of million from this private placement 
interest is payable on the convertible notes on march and september of each year 
the convertible notes will mature on september  unless previously redeemed or repurchased 
the convertible notes are convertible into pinnacle s common stock at the option of the convertible note holders at an initial price of per share  which conversion price is subject to adjustment under the terms of the convertible notes 
we may redeem the convertible notes on or after march  pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated march   we filed a registration statement on may   to cover resales of the convertible notes and the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes 
under the terms of the registration rights agreement  if the registration statement was not declared effective by the sec by september   the interest rate on the convertible notes increases by until the registration statement is declared effective 
we are currently actively pursuing the effectiveness of that registration statement 
in that the registration statement was not declared effective by december   the rate on the notes increased by an additional 
the rate on the notes will not increase to greater than under the terms of the registration rights agreement 
other indebtedness we also use seller financing to fund certain of our communications site acquisitions 
as of december   we had outstanding  in the aggregate amount  million of seller notes bearing interest at rates ranging from to per annum 
public offerings on february   we completed our initial public offering ipo where we sold  shares of our common stock and on march   the over allotment options were exercised and an additional  shares were sold 
the initial price per share was  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the costs of our ipo 
the proceeds were used to acquire communications sites 
on july   we completed a secondary offering of common stock the july offering whereby we sold  shares of our common stock 
the price per share was  resulting in net proceeds from the july offering of approximately million 
the proceeds from the july offering were invested initially in short term liquid securities and were used in conjunction with pinnacle s availability of senior debt under our amended senior credit facility to fund acquisitions  the construction of new communications sites and improvements to existing communications sites 
on january   we completed another secondary offering of common stock the january offering whereby we sold  shares of our common stock 
the price per share was  resulting in net proceeds from the january offering of approximately million 
the proceeds from the january offering were invested initially in short term liquid securities and were used with borrowings made under the senior credit facility to fund acquisitions  the construction of new communications sites and improvements to existing communications sites  all of which was used as of december  the total shares sold included a concurrent exercise of the underwriters over allotment option whereby  shares were sold including  shares sold by certain of our stockholders 
capital investments  including acquisitions  for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in the comparable period 
we spent approximately million on capital investments during the period from october  through december   including various individually immaterial acquisitions in our current targeted acquisitions pipeline  construction and upgrading of additional towers 
depending on availability of additional capital  we expect that we may make substantial capital investments for acquisitions  construction and upgrading of additional towers in we currently estimate that we will make capital investments in of at least million 
to the extent we commit to complete additional significant acquisition opportunities beyond those we have identified and currently believe it is probable that we will complete  that amount may increase materially 
we believe that the availability under our senior credit facility  cash flow from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements for existing properties 
among the factors affecting our ability to complete all probable acquisitions are the availability of financing from our lenders and other sources of public or private debt and equity 
as discussed elsewhere herein began we have found accessing capital on attractive terms to be a challenge 
we had to discontinue an equity offering during the third quarter 
additionally  we have had to significantly scale back our previous communications site acquisition plans  and have had to discontinue our efforts to actively enter the colocation facilities business 
as of december   we estimate that we had cash on hand  borrowings available under our senior credit facility and excess cash flow from operations to pursue approximately million of additional acquisition opportunities during the year we are currently actively pursuing the disposition of the carrier neutral colocation facilities we acquired on terms we believe to be reasonable 
we paid approximately million for such assets 
our disposition efforts thus far have not given us reason to believe that we will not recover at least that amount on the deposition of those assets 
however  our disposition efforts are still at a preliminary stage and we can not be certain at this time of the net amount of funds we will realize from the disposition of those assets  nor the timing of any such disposition 
accordingly  we will continue to operate these assets until such time as they may be disposed of under terms reasonable to us 
our senior credit facility does not require any portion of proceeds from the sale of the colocation facilities business to be used to repay debt  so long as such proceeds are reinvested in permitted acquisitions or capital expenditures within days of the sale transaction 
however  we may consider applying some portion of the proceeds from such sale potentially at least the initial amount borrowed to purchase such facilities to repay debt under our senior credit facility to maintain appropriate post sale leverage ratios 
to the extent that we pursue additional acquisitions  construction activity and other capital expenditures requiring funding in excess of those sources  we will be required to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be commercially available or be permitted by the terms of pinnacle s existing indebtedness 
to the extent that we are unable to finance future capital expenditures  we may not be able to achieve our current revised business strategy 
should we become able to access additional capital on attractive terms  we would revise our business strategy to increase the rate that we acquire communication sites 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates earned on our long term debt 
the impact on earnings and value of our long term debt is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in long term debt subject to variable interest rates of which million was effectively hedged using interest rate swap agreements for both years 
the remaining million and million of long term debt  as of december  and  respectively  is subject to fixed rates of interest 
our variable rate debt  net of hedged amounts exposed  to changes in market interest rates was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of would result in potential losses in future pre tax earnings of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impact of such a charge on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant
