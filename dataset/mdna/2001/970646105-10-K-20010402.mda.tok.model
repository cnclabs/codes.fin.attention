item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company s core focus has been on providing operating leases of aftermarket commercial aircraft engines and other aircraft related equipment 
as of december   the company had a total portfolio including engines counted as discontinued operations of lessees in countries and its total lease portfolio consisted of engines  six commuter aircraft and four spare parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
the company targets medium term operating leases  typically with initial lease terms of three to seven years  where the company retains the risks and benefits associated with the residual value of the leased asset 
the company actively manages its portfolio and structures its leases in order to enhance these residual values 
the company s leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet aircraft engines manufactured by cfm  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engines 
these engines are the most widely used aircraft engines in the world  powering boeing  mcdonnell douglas and airbus aircraft 
in  the company began selling aircraft parts and components through wasi 
wasi s strategy is to focus on the acquisition of aviation equipment  such as whole engines and aircraft  which can be dismantled and sold as parts at a greater profit 
wasi also supplies certain parts and components used in the maintenance  repair and overhaul of the company s portfolio of aircraft and engines 
wasi was sold on november  in  the company began disassembling commercial jet engines and providing parts cleaning  testing and classification services through pacific gas turbine center  incorporated pgtc inc 
pgtc inc 
received certification in november from the faa to perform maintenance  repair and overhaul services for pratt whitney jtd and jtd engines 
pgtc inc commenced repair of jtd engines shortly after receiving faa certification 
in may  the company contributed the operations and assets of pgtc inc to a newly formed joint venture  pacific gas turbine center  llc pgtc llc 
pgtc inc provided and its successor  pgtc llc provides engine disassembly and maintenance  repair and overhaul services to the company and third parties 
the company sold its interest in pgtc llc on november  with the sale of these two businesses  the company no longer engages in the business of parts sales or in dissembling repair and maintenance of aircraft engine  and its core focus is its leasing portfolio 
leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
the vast majority of the company s leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  the company retains title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
the company generally depreciates engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for assets that are leased with an intent to disassemble upon lease termination  the company depreciates the assets over their estimated lease term to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
at the commencement of a lease  the company often collects security deposits normally equal to at least one month s lease payment and maintenance reserves normally equal to one month s estimated maintenance expenses from the lessee 
the security deposit is returned to the lessee after all lease conditions have been met 
maintenance reserves are accumulated in accounts maintained by the company or the company s lenders and are used when normal repair associated with engine use or maintenance is required 
in many cases  to the extent that cumulative maintenance reserves are inadequate to fund normal repairs required prior to return of the engine to the company  the lessee is obligated to cover the shortfall 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of the company s lease portfolio  the company recognizes the gain associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
additionally  to the extent that any deposits or reserves are not included in the sale and the purchaser of the equipment assumes any liabilities associated therewith  such deposits and reserves are included in the gain on sale 
the company engages in the selective purchase and sale of commercial aircraft engines and engine components 
assets acquired for resale are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
gross revenue from the sale of equipment is reflected as sale of equipment acquired for resale with the corresponding cost of the equipment shown as an expense item 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue from continuing operations is summarized as follows year ended december  amount amount dollars in thousands lease revenue   gain on sale of leased equipment   sale of equipment acquired for resale  other income total   leasing related activities 
lease related revenue for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects lease related revenues from additional engines

sfas no 
 as amended  is now effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  the statement requires the recognition of derivative instruments at their fair value and that changes in the fair value are recorded as components of other comprehensive income and or earnings for the period 
the company has a limited number of interest rate swaps which will be accounted for under this statement 
transition arrangements under this statement mean that the fair value of the swaps  estimated at million as of december   would be recorded to other comprehensive income 
future changes in fair value are not estimable at this time 
in september  fasb issued sfas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement provides guidance on the following topics securitization transactions involving financial assets  sales of financial assets such as receivables  loans and securities  collateralized borrowing arrangements  repurchase agreements  and extinguishments of liabilities

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its growth through borrowings secured by its equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt or capital lease obligations 
on november   net proceeds from a private placement of common stock and options were approximately million 
cash flow from operating activities generated million and million in the years ended december  and respectively  and cash flows from operating activities used approximately million in the year ended december  the deficit cash flow from operations in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of used aircraft assets for wasi s inventory and deposits made in connection with future  committed inventory purchases 
the company s primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
approximately million  million and million of funds were used for this purpose in the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   the company had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines  aircraft and spare parts for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   this facility was fully drawn 
the facility had a revolving period which ended september and was extended to january   followed by a term out period ending september the interest rate on this facility at december  is libor plus 
at december   the company had a debt warehouse facility 
the facility is available to a wholly owned special purpose finance subsidiary of the company  wlfc funding corporation  for the financing of jet aircraft engines acquired by or transferred to such finance subsidiary by the company 
the facility is renewable annually 
this facility s structure facilitates public or private securitized note issuances by the special purpose finance subsidiary 
the subsidiary is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
the facility has an eight year initial term with a revolving period to february as of december  followed by a seven year amortization period 
at december   the interest rate was a commercial paper based rate plus a spread of 
the company has guaranteed the obligations under the facility on a limited basis  up to an amount equal to the greater of i the lesser of million and of the outstanding obligations or ii of the outstanding obligations 
assuming compliance with the facility s terms  including sufficiency of collateral  as of december   million was available under this facility 
in february  this facility was increased to million and its revolving period was extended to february at december  the company had a million term loan facility available to a wholly owned consolidated special purpose subsidiary of the company  wlfc ac corporation  for the financing of jet aircraft engines transferred by the company to such subsidiary 
the facility is a five year term loan with final maturity of june  the interest rate is currently libor plus 
this facility is fully drawn 
approximately million of the company s debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the company believes that its current equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain the company s current level of operations 
a decline in the level of internally generated funds or the availability under the company s existing debt facilities would impair the company s ability to sustain its current level of operations 
the company is currently discussing additions to its debt base with its commercial and investment banks 
if the company is not able to access additional debt  its ability to continue to grow its asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and its future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
the company has committed to purchase  during  additional used aircraft and used engines for its operations 
as of december   the company s current commitment to such purchases is not more than million 
management of interest rate exposure to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  a weighted average remaining term of months and a weighted average fixed rate of 
under its borrowing agreement  wlfc funding corporation is required to hedge a certain portion of its million warehouse facility against changes in interest rates 
wlfc funding corporation has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to meet such hedging requirements and to manage the variable interest rate risk related to its debt 
as of december   such swap agreements had notional outstanding amounts totaling million  a weighted average remaining term of months and a weighted average fixed rate of 
the effect of the hedge instruments was to reduce interest expense by million for the year ended december  the company will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
the company may hedge additional amounts of its floating rate debt during the next year 
factors that may affect future results except for historical information contained herein  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report or in other written or oral statements by the company 
the businesses in which the company is engaged are capital intensive businesses 
accordingly  the company s ability to successfully execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations is dependent  in large part  on the availability of debt and equity capital 
the company is currently in the process of negotiating a new revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms or at all or that the new credit facility will be completed on favorable terms or at all 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital  or to complete its new credit facility could result in increased funding costs and would limit the company s ability to i add new aircraft engines  aircraft and spare parts packages to its portfolio  ii fund its working capital needs  and iii finance possible future acquisitions 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company retains title to the aircraft engines  aircraft and parts packages that it leases to third parties 
upon termination of a lease  the company will seek to re lease or sell the aircraft 
the company also engages in the selective purchase and resale of commercial aircraft engines 
on occasion  the company purchases engines without having a firm commitment for their sale 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis  including the following i general market conditions  ii the condition of the aircraft equipment upon termination of the lease  iii the maintenance services performed during the lease term and  as applicable  the number of hours remaining until the next major maintenance is required  iv regulatory changes particularly those imposing environmental  maintenance and other requirements on the operation of aircraft engines  v changes in the supply or cost of aircraft engines  and vi technological developments 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
the failure to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in its operating results 
such fluctuations may be due to a number of factors  including i general economic conditions  ii the timing of sales of engines  iii financial difficulties experienced by airlines  iv interest rates  v fuel costs  vi downturns in the air transportation industry  vii increased fare competition  viii decreases in growth of air traffic  ix unanticipated early lease termination or a default by a lessee  x the timing of engine acquisitions  xi engine marketing activities  xii fluctuations in market prices for the company s assets 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
as a result  the company believes that comparisons to results of operations for preceding periods are not necessarily meaningful and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
a lessee may default in performance of its lease obligations and the company may be unable to enforce its remedies under a lease 
the company s inability to collect receivables due under a lease or to repossess aircraft equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
various airlines have experienced financial difficulties in the past  certain airlines have filed for bankruptcy and a number of such airlines have ceased operations 
in most cases where a debtor seeks protection under chapter of title of the united states code  creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights 
in the case of united states certified airlines  section of the bankruptcy code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment 
the scope of section has been the subject of significant litigation and there is no assurance that the provisions of section will protect the company s investment in an aircraft  aircraft engines or parts in the event of a lessee s bankruptcy 
in addition  section does not apply to lessees located outside of the united states and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection 
leases of spare parts may involve additional risks 
for example  it is likely to be more difficult to recover parts in the event of a lessee default and the residual value of parts may be less ascertainable than an engine 
the company s leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms while many of the company s borrowings are at a floating rate 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate the company pays under its borrowings  and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
in  of the company s lease revenue was generated by leases to foreign customers 
such international leases may present greater risks to the company because certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the united states 
the company is subject to the timing and access to courts and the remedies local laws impose in order to collect its lease payments and recover its assets 
in addition  political instability abroad and changes in international policy also present risk of expropriation of the company s leased engines 
furthermore  many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies 
the company has experienced significant growth in lease revenues during the past year 
the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations  or that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations  in which event the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company may also acquire businesses that would complement or expand the company s existing businesses 
any acquisition or expansion made by the company may result in one or more of the following events i the incurrence of additional debt  ii future charges to earnings related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  iii difficulties in the assimilation of operations  services  products and personnel  iv an inability to sustain or improve historical revenue levels  v diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations  and vi potential loss of key employees 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the markets for the company s products and services are extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of sources 
these include aircraft manufacturers  aircraft and aircraft engine lessors and airline and aircraft service companies 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including greater name recognition  a broader range of material  complementary lines of business and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
in addition  equipment manufacturers  and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the markets that the company serves  thereby significantly increasing industry competition 
there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company s leasing activities generate significant depreciation allowances that provide the company with substantial tax benefits on an ongoing basis 
in addition  the company s lessees currently enjoy favorable accounting and tax treatment by entering into operating leases 
any change to current tax laws or accounting principles that make operating lease financing less attractive or affect the company s recognition of revenue or expense would have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company obtains a substantial portion of its inventories of aircraft and engines from airlines  overhaul facilities and other suppliers 
there is no organized market for aircraft and engines  and the company must rely on field representatives and personnel  advertisements and its reputation as a buyer of surplus inventory in order to generate opportunities to purchase such equipment 
the market for bulk sales of surplus aircraft and engines is highly competitive  in some instances involving a bidding process 
while the company has been able to purchase surplus inventory in this manner successfully in the past  there is no assurance that surplus aircraft and engines of the type required by the company s customers will be available on acceptable terms when needed in the future or that the company will continue to compete effectively in the purchase of such surplus equipment 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt the company s operations and increase its expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
the company currently does not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and its current insurance may not provide coverage for any damages it or its customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in its power supply 
if blackouts interrupt its power supply  the company would be temporarily unable to continue operations 
any such interruption in its ability to continue operations could damage its reputation  harm its ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm its business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in the us prime interest rate  libor rate  or cost of funds based on commercial paper market rates  would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds under its various borrowing facilities 
increases in interest rates to the company  which may cause the company to raise the implicit rates charged to its customers  could result in a reduction in demand for the company s leases 
certain of the company s warehouse credit facilities are variable rate debt 
the company estimates a one percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt net of hedges would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum 
the company estimates a two percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt net of hedges would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum 
the foregoing effect of interest rate changes on per annum interest expense is estimated as constant due to the terms of the company s variable rate borrowings  which generally provide for the maintenance of borrowing levels given adequacy of collateral and compliance with other loan conditions 
the company hedges a portion of its borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
the company is currently required to hedge a portion of debt of the wlfc funding corporation facility 
such hedging activities may limit the company s ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect the company from increases in interest rates 
a portion of the company s leases provide that lease payments be adjusted based on changes in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is likely that the company can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
the company is also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during  of the company s total lease revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of the leases require payment in united states us currency 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making the us dollar denominated lease payments
