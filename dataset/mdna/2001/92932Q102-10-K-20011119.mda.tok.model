item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources as discussed in item  the company purchased both taurus numeric tool  inc and bowman tool machining  inc during fiscal the net result of these transactions was the addition of million of term debt from the company s bank  million from a mortgage from the same bank  million from the company s revolving line of credit  and million from subordinated promissory notes to the seller of bowman and taurus 
during fiscal  the company paid down million of the term debt and  of the mortgage 
also during  the seller of bowman earned the first of two possible contingencies 
therefore  an additional  was added to his subordinated promissory note payable 
during fiscal  the company paid down an additional million of the term debt 
the company also sold its long lake  minnesota property for approximately million  the proceeds from which paid off the balance on the mortgage of million 
also during fiscal  the seller of bowman partially earned the last of two possible contingencies 
the company calculated the amount to be  which was added to his subordinated promissory note payable 
the company s negative working capital of  on august  reflected a decrease of million from the prior year 
the major item that caused the decrease in working capital was the reclassification of one third of the subordinated promissory notes payable into current maturities as those amounts will be due in fiscal the current portion of subordinated notes amounted to approximately million in fiscal the entire amount of the bank term debt was classified as current as that agreement expires in march other decreases in working capital were caused by lower accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by lower accounts payable and accrued compensation 
the fiscal ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to 
to from to for fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
non cash charges for depreciation and amortization as well as a decrease in working capital primarily accounted for the cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal additions to property  plant and equipment were  in fiscal compared to  in and  in these amounts included   and  of machinery acquired through capital leases in  and  respectively 
the major capital expenditures consisted of the acquisition of new production equipment 
proceeds from the sale of equipment amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the relatively large proceeds in resulted from the sale of excess equipment derived from the consolidation initiative 
as mentioned previously  the company sold its long lake  minnesota property for million in fiscal the company s total debt was million at august  and consisted of million of bank term debt  seller subordinated notes of million and capital lease obligations of million 
the total debt was million lower that fiscal at august  and august  the company had available a line of credit of  at august   the outstanding balance on the line was  with no balance at august  at august   the maximum amount available to borrow on the line of credit was approximately million 
it is managements belief that internally generated funds combined with the line of credit will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its financial requirements during fiscal results of operations net sales of million decreased million or from fiscal sales of million and  or from fiscal sales of million 
sales decreased in as compared to for three primary reasons 
the first was the overall downturn in the economy affected all markets served by the company 
secondly  as mentioned in previous q s  a major customer made the decision to effectvely consign raw materials for its manufacturing programs to the company instead of wsi purchasing the material and subsequently reselling the material after manufacture 
this consignment thus resulted in lower sales to that customer 
the last reason for the decreased in sales was the loss of a larger customer at the end of the second quarter 
the sales decrease in versus would have been approximately equivalent to the comparison had bowman and taurus been included in for the full fiscal year 
however  taurus was acquired in the middle of fiscal while bowman was acquired at the end of fiscal in fiscal  the company reported a net loss of million or 
per share compared to net earnings of  or 
per share in and  or 
per share in the net earnings in fiscal included a gain from the termination of the company s defined pension plan of  a gain on the sale of excess equipment of  and  in severance costs paid to employees affected by the long lake plant shutdown 
the gross margin on parts sold in fiscal was of sales compared to of sales and of sales in and  respectively 
margin improved in versus and despite the lower level of sales 
the primary reason for this was the increased efficiencies obtained at the new taurus and bowman manufacturing plants as compared to the company s long lake  minnesota facility which was open a partial year in and a full year in fiscal gross margin was hampered as the year went on and the level of sales softened gross margin in the first quarter was versus in the fourth quarter 
gross margin in was negatively affected by relocation and training costs associated with the consolidation initiative 
selling and administrative expense of million in fiscal was a decrease of  and an increase of million from fiscal years and  respectively 
the versus increase was related to the addition of taurus and bowman expenses for a full year 
the slight decrease versus was a combination of lower incentive compensation and profit sharing partially offset by the carrying cost of the long lake building being included in selling and administrative expense for a longer period in versus interest and other income of  was  lower in fiscal than  and  lower than primarily due to less interest income due to lower average cash balances 
interest and other expense of  in fiscal was  lower than and  higher than the lower interest in versus was due to the lower level of debt during the year as compared to the prior year 
the interest expense was higher versus as the acquisition debt did not appear on the balance sheet until after the middle of income tax expense is significantly less than the statutory amount due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in each of fiscal and see notes to consolidated financial statements regarding recent accounting standards to be adopted
