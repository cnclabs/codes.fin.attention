item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in december and have grown primarily through a series of strategic acquisitions 
for acquisitions accounted for as a purchase  our consolidated financial statements reflect the financial results of the purchased entities from the respective dates of the purchase 
for all transactions accounted for using the pooling of interests method  our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated as if the transactions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
our acquisitions are summarized in the following table method of transaction date accounting alltel healthcare information services  inc alltel purchase sdk medical computer services corporation sdk purchase emtek healthcare systems emtek a division of motorola  inc motorola purchase healthvision  inc acquired by transition healthvision purchase transition systems  inc transition pooling powercenter systems  inc pcs pooling intelus corporation and meddata systems  inc intelus and med data wholly owned subsidiaries of sun gard data systems  inc purchase msi solutions  inc and msi integrated services  inc 
collectively  msi pooling in july  we sold med data for a total sales price of million in cash 
during july  we invested in healthvision  inc  or healthvision  a dallas based  privately held internet healthcare company  in conjunction with vha  inc and investment entities affiliated with general atlantic partners  llc 
we purchased  shares of common stock for  which at the time represented of the outstanding common stock on an if converted basis 
healthvision provides internet solutions to hospital organizations to assist them in improving patient care in the local communities they serve 
in connection with our relationship with healthvision  we have entered into a joint marketing arrangement under which both organizations agreed to jointly market products and services to their customers 
under this agreement  we paid healthvision  during we account for our investment in healthvision using the equity method of accounting 
as of december  our shares represented of the common stock of healthvision on an if converted basis 
during  the company earned revenues of million and had accounts receivable due from healthvision of million at december  revenues revenues are derived from sales of systems and services  which include the licensing of software  software and hardware maintenance  implementation and training  remote hosting  outsourcing  networking services and consulting  and from the sale of computer hardware 
our products and services are generally sold to customers pursuant to contracts that range in duration from three to ten years 
we have generally licensed our software products pursuant to arrangements that include maintenance for periods that range from three to seven years 
for software licenses that are bundled with services and maintenance that require significant implementation efforts and provide for payments upon the achievement of implementation milestones  we have generally recognized revenues using the percentage of completion method 
under these arrangements  software license fees and implementation fees are recognized over the implementation period  which has typically ranged from to months 
revenues from other software licenses  which are bundled with long term maintenance agreements  are recognized on a straight line basis over the contracted maintenance period 
remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under long term agreements that are generally of five to ten years in duration 
revenues under these arrangements are recognized monthly as the work is performed 
revenues related to other support services  such as training  consulting  and other implementation services  are recognized when the services are performed 
we recognize revenues from the sale of hardware upon delivery of the equipment to the customer 
in  in response to our customers desire for flexible pricing and more comprehensive bundled information technology solutions  we began to offer our customers the option of purchasing our solutions under arrangements that bundled the software license fees including the right to future products within the suite sold  implementation  maintenance  outsourcing  remote hosting  networking services and other related services in one comprehensive contract that provides for monthly or annual payments over the term of the contract 
we generally recognize revenues under these arrangements on a monthly basis over the term of the contract  which typically ranges from seven to ten years 
the shift toward providing comprehensive bundled solutions  together with the completion in early of the implementation of some of our contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method  contributed to the decline in our revenues in  particularly in the second  third and fourth quarters of under these comprehensive bundled arrangements  revenues are recognized over the term of the contract consistent with the timing of the performance of all services offered under the arrangement 
generally  less revenue is recognized under these arrangements during the first to months compared to traditional licensing arrangements that we sell 
if the level of new contracted business under these comprehensive bundled arrangements increases  we believe that it will mitigate some of the volatility in our revenues 
however  if we continue to increase contract signings under these type of arrangements as opposed to our traditional licensing arrangements  our revenues may continue to be adversely affected for the next two to three years as compared to historic results 
costs of revenues the principal costs of systems and services revenues are salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for implementation  remote hosting and outsourcing personnel 
other significant costs of systems and services revenues are the amortization of acquired technology  capitalized software development costs and a network services intangible asset 
acquired technology is amortized over three to five years based upon the estimated economic life of the underlying asset  and capitalized software development costs are amortized generally over three years on a straight line basis commencing upon general release of the related product or based on the ratio that current revenues bear to total anticipated revenues for the applicable product 
the network services intangible asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
cost of revenues related to hardware sales include only our cost to acquire the hardware from the manufacturer 
gross profit margin the cost of revenues associated with both our traditional licensing arrangements and the more comprehensive arrangements discussed above are primarily related to services  which are expensed as incurred over the service period 
the shift to these bundled comprehensive arrangements adversely affected margins in the second  third and fourth quarters of as our costs are higher and revenues are lower in the first to months under these arrangements than under the traditional license arrangements 
this is due to the costs associated with our providing significant other services  including remote hosting  networking and outsourcing  at the same time we are performing our implementation services  which generally occurs during the early years of the arrangement 
this  coupled with the timing of revenues discussed above  contributed to our reduced margins in the second  third and fourth quarters of although we expect margins to return to historic levels in the long term  as more customers enter into these types of arrangements our margins may continue to be adversely affected 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions  we inherited contracts that did not provide a reasonable margin for the cost and scope of the services involved 
in order to build customer loyalty  we continued to honor our commitments under these contracts during and in some cases performed work outside the scope of these contracts for which we received nominal or no fees 
this activity adversely impacted our margins in the second  third and fourth quarters of as we continued to incur costs with lower incremental revenues 
to address this problem  we are negotiating payments for future work under some of these contracts  and we have decided not to continue our work under some other contracts  which has resulted in a write down in the related accounts receivable 
additionally  we have consolidated our research and development and implementation functions to improve operating efficiencies 
while we believe these actions will help to mitigate the future effect of these contracts on our operating results  we believe that margins may continue to be adversely affected as we continue to provide services under these contracts 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions and related overhead costs 
other costs include expenditures for marketing programs  public relations  trade shows  advertising and related communications 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead associated with our design  development and testing of new products 
we capitalize internal software development costs subsequent to attaining technological feasibility 
these costs are amortized as an element of cost of revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for administration  executive  finance  legal  human resources  purchasing and internal systems personnel  as well as accounting and legal fees and expenses 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset  which is generally not longer than five years 
acquisition related intangible assets  which primarily consist of the value of ongoing customer relationships and goodwill  are amortized based upon the estimated economic life of the asset at the time of the acquisition  and will therefore vary among acquisitions 
taxes as of december   we had operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million 
the carryforwards expire in varying amounts through and are subject to certain restrictions 
based on evidence then available  we did not record any benefit for income taxes at december   and  because we believe it is more likely then not that we would not realize our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax assets 
results of operations compared to total revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from million for systems and services revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for this decrease in total revenues was primarily attributable to the shift toward providing comprehensive bundled solutions  the completion of the implementations under arrangements which were recognized under the percentage of completion method and the less favorable contracts we inherited as a result of recent acquisitions  which are all discussed above 
in addition  our proposed transactions with shared medical systems corp  or sms  and neoforma 
com  inc  or neoforma  which we have since abandoned  resulted in a significant diversion of management s time and attention  which also adversely affected revenues during early hardware revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to decreased volume of hardware sales as a result of less hardware intensive transactions 
total cost of revenues increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for increased costs of system and services revenues were partially offset by a decrease in costs of hardware revenues 
costs of systems and services revenues increased as a result of higher royalty related expenses associated with revenue recognized during the period  an increased level of outsourcing revenue and associated expenses  and a charge of million to write down some receivables related to contracts assumed in acquisitions 
furthermore  we recorded a charge of million for other costs related to finalizing our acquisition integrations 
these amounts were partially offset by decreased amortization of acquired technology in connection with acquisitions completed in prior years and by cost savings associated with the consolidation of our research and development and implementation functions 
we also recorded acquisition related amortization of acquired technology and a network services asset of million and million for and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the increase was primarily due to an increase in commissions as the result of an increase in new contracts research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the decrease was due primarily to a write off of million of capitalized software development costs related to duplicate products with no alternative future use due to the acquisition of msi in and the realization of integration synergies 
research and development expenses that were capitalized were million and million for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the decrease was primarily due to our restructuring plans that were completed in late and this was partially offset by a million write down of receivables during depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the decrease was primarily the result of certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated  partially offset by depreciation related to purchases of fixed assets during the for and  respectively  we recorded acquisition related amortization of million and million 
during  we initiated and completed a restructuring of our operations  which resulted in a charge totaling million related to the closing of duplicate facilities and the termination of employees 
during  we initiated and completed another restructuring of our operations 
this restructuring rationalized employee headcount after we completed the integration of our acquisitions 
additionally  we consolidated our research and development and implementation functions 
charges in connection with this restructuring in totaled million 
pooling and transaction costs increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for pooling and transaction costs incurred during were related to the poolings of powercenter and msi 
the transaction costs during were primarily the result of costs associated with the abandoned transactions with sms and neoforma 
other income recorded during the year ended december  related to a realized gain on the sale of our investment in sms of million  which was offset in part by a loss on sale of our investment in equity securities 
as a result of these factors  net loss increased to million for the year ended december  from million for compared to total revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase was caused primarily by the inclusion in of twelve months of operations of hv compared to only one month in  and nine months of operations of intelus 
also contributing to the increase was new business contracted in and incremental sales of hardware 
total cost of revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in cost was due primarily to the associated growth in revenues  offset in part by a reduction in expenses related to integrating the acquisitions 
as a percentage of total revenues  the total cost of revenues decreased from in to in included in total cost of revenues is acquisition related amortization expense of million and million in and  respectively  related to the amortization of acquired technology and a network services asset 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in marketing and sales expense was due primarily to the addition of marketing and direct sales personnel following the acquisitions and the continued hiring of additional marketing and direct sales personnel 
as a percentage of total revenues  marketing and sales expenses decreased from in to in research and development expenses increased by million  or  from million  or of total revenues  in to million  or of total revenues  in these amounts exclude amortization of previously capitalized expenditures  which are recorded as cost of revenues 
the increase was due primarily to the inclusion in of nine months of operations of intelus  the continued development of our sunrise clinical management product suite and a million write off of previously capitalized research and development expenditures related to duplicate products with no alternate use as a result of the msi acquisition 
in  we wrote off million of previously capitalized expenditures related to duplicate products as a result of acquisitions 
capitalized research and development expenditures increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in capitalized software development costs was primarily due to the acquisitions and the continued development of our sunrise clinical management product suite 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the timing of the purchase acquisitions and was partially offset by savings due to overall expense reductions 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of hv 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expense decreased from in to in included in depreciation and amortization expense is acquisition related amortization of million and million in and  respectively 
during  in connection with the msi transaction  we recorded a stock compensation charge of million related to the required vesting of stock options that were granted to former msi employees 
we also incurred pooling costs of million related to the msi transaction 
additionally  in july  in connection with the formation of healthvision  we incurred a stock compensation charge of  related to the accelerated vesting of former employees stock options 
during the quarter ended june   we initiated a restructuring of our operations 
the restructuring was completed during the quarter ended september  and resulted in a charge totaling million related to the closing of duplicate facilities and the termination of certain employees 
as a result of these factors  net loss decreased from million in to million in acquired in process research and development in connection with the alltel  sdk and hv acquisitions  we wrote off in process research and development totaling million and million in and million in  respectively 
these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
we are using the acquired in process research and development to create new products  which will become part of the sunrise product suite over the next several years 
we generally released some products using the acquired in process technology and expect to release additional products through we expect that the acquired in process research and development will be successfully developed  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of these products will be achieved 
the nature of the efforts required for us to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet their design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the products  including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from these projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
these estimates were based on several assumptions  including those summarized below for each of the respective acquisitions 
through december   revenues and operating profit attributable to the acquired in process technology have not materially differed from the projections used in determining its value 
throughout and  we have continued the development of the in process technology that was acquired in the transactions 
we are installing modules derived from the acquired in process technology in various field trial sites and have activated some sites 
additionally  we have begun to successfully market certain aspects of the technology to new and existing customers 
we expect to continue releasing products derived from the technology through we continue to believe the projections used reasonably estimate the future benefits attributable to the in process technology 
however  we cannot assure you that deviations from these projections will not occur 
if these projects to develop commercial products based on the acquired in process technology are not successfully completed  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets may become impaired 
alltel the primary purchased in process technology acquired in the alltel acquisition was the client server based core application modules of an integrated clinical software product whose functionality included order management  health information management  physician applications  nursing applications  pharmacy  laboratory and radiology applications and ancillary support 
additionally  the product included functionality facilitating the gathering and analysis of data throughout a healthcare organization  a data integration engine and various other functionality 
revenue attributable to the in process technology was assumed to increase over the twelve year projection period at annual rates ranging from to  resulting in annual revenues of approximately million to million 
these projections were based on assumed penetration of the existing customer base  new customer transactions  historical retention rates and experiences of prior product releases 
the projections reflected accelerated revenue growth in the first five years  to  as the products derived from the in process technology were generally released 
in addition  the projections were based on annual revenue to be derived from long term contractual arrangements ranging from seven to ten years 
new customer contracts for products developed from the in process technology were assumed to peak in  with rapidly declining sales volume in the years to as other new products were expected to enter the market 
the projections assumed no new customer contracts after projected revenue in years after was determined using a annual growth rate  which reflected contractual increases 
operating profit was projected to grow over the projection period at rates ranging from to  resulting in incremental annual operating profit loss of approximately million to million 
the operating profit projections during the years to assumed a growth rate slightly higher than the revenue projections 
the higher growth rate was attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above  together with research and development costs then expected to remain constant at approximately million annually 
the operating profit projections included a annual growth rate for the years after consistent with the revenue projections 
through december   revenues and operating profit attributable to the acquired in process technology have not materially differed from the projections used in determining its value 
through december   we continued the development of the in process technology that was acquired in the alltel transaction 
we have installed modules derived from the acquired in process technology and are continuing to develop additional functionality from this technology 
additionally  we have begun to successfully market certain aspects of the technology to new and existing customers 
we expect to continue releasing products derived from the technology through we continue to believe the projections used reasonably estimated the future benefits attributable to the in process technology 
however  no assurance can be given that deviations from these projections will not occur 
the projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value using the weighted average cost of capital 
the weighted average cost of capital calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise 
the weighted average cost of capital used in the projections was 
this rate was determined by applying the capital asset pricing model 
this method yielded an estimated average weighted average cost of capital of approximately 
a risk premium was added to reflect the business risks associated with our stage of development  as well as the technology risk associated with the in process software  resulting in a weighted average cost of capital of 
in addition  the value of customer relationships was calculated using a discount rate of and a return to net tangible assets was estimated using a rate of return of 
the value of the goodwill was calculated as the remaining intangible value not otherwise allocated to identifiable intangible assets  resulting in an implied discount rate on the goodwill of approximately 
we used a discount rate for valuing existing technology because this technology faced substantially the same risks as the business as a whole 
accordingly  a rate equal to the weighted average cost of capital of was used 
we used a discount rate for valuing in process technology 
the spread over the existing technology discount rate reflected the inherently greater risk of the research and development efforts 
the spread reflected the nature of the development efforts relative to the existing base of technology and the potential market for the in process technology once the products were released 
we estimated that the costs to develop the purchased in process technology acquired in the alltel acquisition into commercially viable products would be approximately million in the aggregate through  or million per year from to sdk the purchased in process technology acquired in the sdk acquisition comprised three major enterprise wide modules in the areas of physician billing  home health care billing and long term care billing  a graphical user interface  a corporate master patient index  and a standard query language module 
revenue attributable to the in process technology was assumed to increase in the first three years of the ten year projection period at annual rates ranging from to  then to decrease over the remaining years at annual rates ranging from to as other products were released in the market place 
projected annual revenue ranged from approximately million to million over the term of the projections 
these projections were based on assumed penetration of the existing customer base  synergies as a result of the sdk acquisition  new customer transactions and historical retention rates 
projected revenues from the in process technology were assumed to peak in and decline from to as other new products were expected to enter the market 
operating profit was projected to grow at annual rates ranging from to during the first three years  decreasing during the remaining years of the projection period similar to the revenue growth projections described above 
projected annual operating profit ranged from approximately  to million over the term of the projections 
through december   revenues and operating profit attributable to in process technology have been consistent with the projections 
however  we cannot assure you that deviations from these projections will not occur in the future 
the weighted average cost of capital used in the analysis was 
this rate was determined by applying the capital asset pricing model and a review of venture capital rates of return for companies in a similar life cycle stage 
we used a discount rate for valuing existing and in process technology because both technologies face substantially the same risks as the business as a whole 
accordingly  a rate equal to the weighted average cost of capital of was used 
we estimated that the costs to develop the in process technology acquired in the sdk acquisition would be approximately million in the aggregate through the year  comprised of  in   in and  in transition in connection with the purchase by transition of hv  based on an independent appraisal  we recorded million of intangible assets  which included million of acquired in process research and development 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represented development projects in areas that had not reached technological feasibility and which had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amount was charged to operations at the date of the acquisition 
balance sheet as of december  compared to december  accounts receivable accounts receivable decreased during primarily due to the charge totaling million to write down certain receivables related to contracts assumed in acquisitions and a decrease in revenue in additionally  our hardware shipments were lower in the fourth quarter of compared to acquired technology acquired technology decreased during due to amortization 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase recorded to finalize the purchase price allocation related to the intelus acquisition 
intangibles intangibles decreased during due to amortization 
deferred revenue deferred revenue decreased during primarily due to the completion of certain implementation efforts at the former transition customers and certain significant network projects 
other current liabilities other current liabilities decreased during primarily due to the timing of payments related to accounts payable and accrued expenses acquired from the acquisitions including deal costs of transition and the payment of employee related liabilities due to the acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources during  we used million in operations  including approximately million of annual employee compensation related liabilities paid during the first quarter 
investing activities used million for the purchase of fixed assets and the funding of development costs partially offset by the sale of investments 
financing activities provided million  due to borrowings under an equipment financing arrangement  exercise of stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we have a revolving credit facility with a commercial bank  that expires may  and provides for maximum borrowings of up to million 
available borrowings under this facility are based on accounts receivable and other criteria 
as of december   our available borrowings under the facility were approximately million and there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and our available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million 
subsequent to december   we completed a follow on public offering for  shares of our common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including the rate of growth of our sales and the timing and level of research and development activities 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash generated from our future operations and amounts available under the existing revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we generally buy investments with maturities of days or less 
based upon the nature of our investments  we do not expect any material loss from our investments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the company accounts for cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents are short term  highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less 
cash equivalents are carried at cost  which approximates fair market value 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
