furthermore  farmer mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of revisions to any forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
overview was another year of solid growth and strong financial performance for farmer mac  notwithstanding challenges created by the continuing industry wide weakness in new agricultural mortgage volume due to uncertainties in the agricultural sector 
diluted earnings per share were for  a percent increase over diluted earnings per share  marking the fifth consecutive year during which farmer mac achieved significant increases in profitability 
net income rose from million in to million in the principal factors contributing to the year s record earnings were increases in net interest income from spread on portfolio retention of cash window and portfolio purchases and guarantee fees on the higher cumulative amount of guarantees outstanding 
net interest income was up million to million in  from million in  as farmer mac guaranteed securities and loans held by farmer mac increased by million 
guarantee fee income grew percent from million in to million in  as outstanding guarantees increased million  or percent  to billion and surpassed the billion level for the first time in farmer mac s history 
the year s increase in guarantee fee income is indicative of the annuity like nature of that income 
the increase in outstanding guarantee volume was achieved while farmer mac continued to maintain control over its operating expenses 
during  operating expenses increased by only percent over and equaled percent of total revenues  compared to percent in while increasing its level of guarantees  farmer mac maintained a close watch on the quality of mortgages covered by its guarantee  despite continued stress in some segments of the us agricultural economy in at year end  farmer mac i loans purchased or guaranteed after changes to the corporation s statutory charter in placed farmer mac in the position of first loss guarantor post act loans showed a modest increase in delinquency rates of days or longer  to percent of the principal amount of all post act loans  compared to percent at the end of external percent first loss interests mitigate farmer mac s credit exposure to pre act loans 
farmer mac anticipates fluctuations in the delinquency rate from quarter to quarter  with higher levels likely in the first and third quarters of each year  due to the semiannual payment characteristics of most farmer mac loans 
farmer mac experienced no loan losses resulting in net charge offs to the reserve in  compared with losses totaling  in it is anticipated that delinquencies will likely increase and some loan losses will likely be incurred in  due both to the aging of the guarantee portfolio and to pressures from growing inventories and weak markets for agricultural commodities and products worldwide along with low prices and economic uncertainty in the agricultural sector  following the trend of the last several years 
nevertheless  as reported by the usda  agricultural income during was strong  due in large part to record government support payments made to farmers during the year  which generally helped to maintain economic stability in the agricultural sector and contributed to stable agricultural land prices in most regions of the nation during as a result  the overall financial condition of the agricultural sector  with the exception of certain producer groups that do not receive significant government payments  remains sound and agricultural mortgage credit quality general remains good 
it is too early to predict what level of federal support will be provided to agriculture in  but farmer mac believes that the preservation of the economic stability of the agricultural sector will continue to be a high priority for both congress and the new administration  as it has been during the last several years 
though increased reliance on government payments enabled farmers and ranchers to meet their existing mortgage obligations more easily during  the economic uncertainty of the agricultural economy is likely to continue to mute farmers demand for new agricultural mortgage loans during we believe that farmer mac has responded effectively to these market conditions by expanding its product offerings to include  among other things  revolving lines of credit backed by agricultural mortgages to help farm borrowers with equity in their land meet short term liquidity needs 
in addition  by re emphasizing to agricultural lenders the opportunity to reduce their concentrated exposures to local agricultural credit risks  farmer mac believes it can develop swap and ltspc transactions and similar structures during  as lenders become more attentive to their own issues of liquidity and portfolio diversification 
also  anticipated lower interest rates during should contribute to lower debt expenses for farm borrowers and increased long term  fixed rate mortgage activity 
as we evaluate farmer mac s business prospects for and beyond  certain factors and conditions remain likely to constrain our progress 
many institutions that dominate agricultural lending today have an organizational bias toward retaining loans in portfolio rather than selling them  notwithstanding corporate finance and capital planning benefits they might realize through participation in farmer mac s programs 
some lending institutions subsidize their agricultural mortgage loan rates out of higher rates on non mortgage loans  or by low return use of equity  both of which generate uneconomic competition with farmer mac s loan rates 
further potentially affecting the growth of farmer mac s business is the expanded authority of federal home loan banks fhlbs  under legislation enacted in november  to accept agricultural loans as collateral for their own advances and to relax their membership requirements for small banks 
at this time  it is still too early to assess fully the impact  if any  of these changes upon farmer mac 
there are  however  several important distinctions between the expanded fhlb authority and the benefits farmer mac brings to agricultural lenders  including the capital relief available under farmer mac s loan sale and purchase commitment programs  the lower over collateralization requirements under farmer mac s agvantage program and the lower interest rate risk of participation in the farmer mac programs 
although farmer mac has grown steadily stronger during the last five years  that growth has depended  and will continue to depend  upon ongoing increases in the volume of loans covered by its guarantee 
farmer mac s current share of the agricultural mortgage market remains relatively small  due to the gradual nature of market penetration in a mature market 
however  our dramatic growth rates in the years since implies a significant ongoing opportunity for expansion of business volume 
over the long term  our strategy for realizing farmer mac s business development and profitability goals is to prompt agricultural mortgage lenders  whether traditional or non traditional  to continue to expand their use of our guarantee through market oriented programs and products that clearly benefit the nation s farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners

this was largely a result of decreases in swaps and ltspcs from million in to million in see risk management credit risk management for a description of ltspcs 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of percent and percent in farmer mac i cash purchases and farmer mac ii guarantees  respectively 
the net balance of loans held or guarantees outstanding increased percent from billion to billion 
swaps and ltspcs typically involve seasoned loans  while cash purchase transactions usually represent acquisitions of newly originated loans 
the overall decreases for from are a result of economic stress in the agricultural sector  which reduced demand for new originations of agricultural mortgages 
farmer mac decides whether to retain ambs or to sell ambs to capital market investors based on market conditions 
during  farmer mac issued million of ambs  million of which were retained by farmer mac 
indicators of future purchase and guarantee volume  particularly cash purchase activity  include outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i loans and the total balance of loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased 
most purchase commitments entered into by farmer mac are mandatory delivery commitments 
if a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver the loans required thereunder within the specified time period  farmer mac requires the seller to pay a fee to extend or cancel the commitment 
at december   outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i loans totaled million  compared to million at december   while loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled million at december   compared to million at december  not all of these loans are purchased  as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller 
while significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market for agricultural mortgages  farmer mac continues to face the challenges of establishing a new market where none previously existed 
acceptance of farmer mac s programs is increasing among lenders  reflecting the competitive rates  terms and products offered and the advantages farmer mac believes its programs provide 
for farmer mac to succeed in realizing its business development and profitability goals over the longer term  the use of farmer mac s programs and products by agricultural mortgage lenders  whether traditional or non traditional  must continue to expand 
balance sheet review assets 
as of december   total assets were billion compared to billion at december  the increase in total assets was primarily due to growth in program assets  which increased million during to a total of billion 
during  farmer mac purchased million of farmer mac i and ii loans 
during the same period  non program assets increased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the remaining growth in total assets was due to increases in the balance of interest and guarantee fees receivable  which increased in proportion to the growth of program assets and total guarantees 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased from billion at december   to billion at december  the increase in liabilities was primarily due to growth in notes payable  which corresponded to the growth in on balance sheet program assets 
the remaining increase in total liabilities was due to increases in accrued interest payable  as a result of the increase in outstanding notes payable  and the reserve for losses

risk management interest rate risk management 
interest rate risk is the risk that interest rate changes could materially affect the value  or future earnings  of farmer mac 
farmer mac is exposed to two primary sources of interest rate risk a farmer mac i and ii securities and other assets held for investment  and b loans 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets held for investment because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities 
this risk is primarily related to farmer mac i and ii securities because of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities  thereby increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches 
cash flow mismatches in a changing rate environment can reduce the value or earnings of the corporation if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower yielding investments when farmer mac s funding costs cannot be correspondingly reduced  or if assets repay more slowly than expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher cost debt 
yield maintenance provisions associated with many of the loans underlying farmer mac i securities reduce  but do not eliminate  this risk 
yield maintenance provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment to farmer mac when they prepay their loans 
when reinvested with the prepaid principal  this payment generates substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid 
none of the loans underlying farmer mac ii securities have yield maintenance provisions  although some carry fixed or declining percentage prepayment penalties 
fixed rate loans without yield maintenance provisions represented percent and percent of the total balance of loans underlying on balance sheet farmer mac i and ii securities as of december   and december   respectively 
there is less interest rate risk related to farmer mac s portfolio of non program assets because it consists almost entirely of investments that mature or reprice within one year 
however  farmer mac does invest in certain adjustable rate investments that limit or cap the amount that an investment coupon rate can increase 
such capped investments totaled million and million at december   and december   respectively 
farmer mac s primary strategy for managing interest rate risk related to farmer mac i and ii securities and other assets held for investment is to fund them with liabilities that have similar durations  or average cash flow patterns over time  and provide flexibility to accommodate changing prepayment rates in changing interest rate environments 
to achieve the desired funding objective  farmer mac uses a mix of short term discount notes and callable and non callable medium term notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
by using a mix of liabilities that includes callable debt  the duration of the liabilities will tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the duration of the assets the rate of change in the duration of an asset or liability to a change in interest rates is referred to as convexity 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to capped adjustable rate investments by purchasing interest rate contracts that effectively uncap the investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
farmer mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans  including loans that farmer mac has committed to acquire  but not yet purchased 
when farmer mac commits to purchase a qualified loan  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loan and the time it either a sells ambs backed by the loan  or b issues debt to retain the loan in its portfolio although issuing debt to fund the loans as an investment does not fully mitigate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities  as discussed above 
as of december   the balance of loans committed or purchased and not yet sold or funded as retained investments totaled million 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans  and the debt to be issued to fund the loans as retained investments  through the use of forward sale contracts on the debt and mortgage backed securities of other government sponsored enterprises gses and futures contracts involving us treasury securities 
at december   farmer mac did not own treasury futures contracts and the total notional balance of gse forward sale contracts was million 
farmer mac primarily uses gse forward sale contracts since such instruments reduce farmer mac s interest rate exposure to changes in both treasury rates and ambs and debt spreads 
for more information about off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
farmer mac has established policies and implemented interest rate risk management procedures to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk 
the primary methodology used by management to monitor farmer mac s interest rate risk exposure is measurement of the sensitivity of farmer mac s market value of equity mve to changes in interest rates 
this and other risk measures are reviewed regularly by management s asset and liability committee and the finance committee of the board of directors to monitor compliance with farmer mac s interest rate risk policy limits 
the simulation of mve involves generating multiple paths for future interest rates starting from a base yield curve and then discounting the estimated cash flows under those rate paths to arrive at the estimated fair value of farmer mac s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
farmer mac uses a commercially developed model to perform the mve analyses 
the analysis  which is based on farmer mac s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments  and does not assume any new business  measures the change in mve under seven interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate scenarios include a base case in which the base yield curve is equal to the current yield curve  and six parallel and instantaneous shocks to the base yield curve plus and minus  and basis points 
inherent in the mve sensitivity analysis presented is the assumption that interest rate changes occur as instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve  in reality  such shifts are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
in addition  actual future market conditions may differ materially from those assumed in the analysis 
for example  actual loan prepayments and farmer mac ambs and debt spreads may differ significantly from those assumed in the analysis 
accordingly  the results of the mve sensitivity analysis should not be viewed as a projection of future results 
the following schedule summarizes the results of farmer mac s mve sensitivity analysis at december  and percentage change in mve from base case december  interest rate scenario bp bp bp bp bp bp as of december   farmer mac was in compliance with the policy limits established by the corporation to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk 
credit risk management 
farmer mac s primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages 
farmer mac is exposed to credit risk on loans it holds  as well as on loans backing securities issued to third parties  because of farmer mac s guarantee of the timely payment of principal  including any balloon payments  and interest on the securities 
farmer mac is also exposed to credit risk on loans it has committed to purchase through ltspc transactions 
the ltspc transaction  which is a variation on a swap transaction  permits a lender to segregate a pool of loans in its portfolio and transfer the credit risk on those loans to farmer mac 
in return  farmer mac receives fees based on the outstanding balance of the segregated loans which approximate what would have been farmer mac s guarantee fee had the loans been exchanged with farmer mac in a swap transaction 
for several years  farmer mac has conducted its own guarantee fee adequacy analyses  using stress test models developed internally and with the assistance of outside experts 
those analyses have taken into account the diverse and dissimilar characteristics of the various asset categories for which farmer mac must manage its risk exposures  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets under management shifts with growth in the business and the addition of new asset categories 
loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac can be divided into three groups a pre act farmer mac i loans  b post act farmer mac i loans  and c farmer mac ii loans 
for pre act loans  farmer mac s credit risk exposure is mitigated by subordinated interests 
before farmer mac incurs a credit loss  full recourse must first be taken against the subordinated interest 
the act eliminated the subordinated interest requirement 
as a result  farmer mac assumes percent of the credit risk on post act farmer mac i loans 
farmer mac mitigates the credit risk related to pre and post act loans through the application of its underwriting and appraisal standards and by requiring collateral in the form of agricultural real estate 
see business farmer mac i underwriting and appraisal standards 
in response to the increased credit risk related to post act loans  farmer mac increased the guarantee fee rate and lowered the loan to value requirements for post act loans relative to those previously required for pre act loans 
farmer mac s credit exposure on farmer mac ii loans is covered by the full faith and credit of the united states by virtue of the usda guarantee of the principal and interest on all guaranteed portions 
farmer mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure to pre act farmer mac i loans because of the subordinated interests  or to farmer mac ii loans because of the usda guarantee 
the outstanding principal balance of loans held or guaranteed by farmer mac is summarized in the table below 
december  in thousands farmer mac i loans post act   pre act   farmer mac ii loans   farmer mac continually assesses its credit risk exposure related to post act farmer mac i loans by monitoring agricultural economic conditions and evaluating the credit quality of those loans 
despite adverse trends in agricultural economic conditions  including low commodity prices and reduced export demand  in and continuing into  farmer mac believes that the credit quality of the post act farmer mac i loans remains good  based on farmer mac s credit underwriting  appraisal and diversification standards and the actual performance of the loans 
farmer mac s diversification standards limit its credit exposure in a particular geographic region or commodity to a percentage of the total principal amount of all loans outstanding  adjusted for the credit quality of the loans in that particular geographic region or commodity group based on the loan to value  debt service coverage  equity to asset and working capital to current asset ratios 
the following tables set forth the loan to value based on current loan balance  geographic and commodity distributions of the post act farmer mac i loans as of december  and for information regarding loan to value  commodity and geographic distributions of all farmer mac i loans  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
distribution of post act loans at december  by original loan to value ratio to to to to to to total weighted average loan to value ratio by geographic region mid north mid south northeast northwest southeast southwest total by commodity crops livestock permanent plantings part time farms total regions are defined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   farmer mac s highest geographic concentrations were in the southwest and northwest regions 
farmer mac s largest commodity concentration at december  was crops  however  this group consists of several specific commodities  including cotton  feed grains  vegetables and other crops  none of which comprised more than percent of the total portfolio 
the effectiveness of farmer mac s underwriting  appraisal and diversification standards is reflected primarily through the level of defaulted loans and related credit losses 
at december   post act farmer mac i loans that were days or more past due referred to as non performing or impaired loans totaled million  or percent of the total principal amount of all post act loans 
the balance of non performing loans at december   was million  or percent of all post act loans 
the increase in the delinquency rate of the post act farmer mac i loans from december  to december   was due to the growing number of loans that are approaching their anticipated peak default years and adverse conditions affecting the agricultural economy 
the following table segregates the post act delinquency rate at december  by year of origination  geographic region and commodity 
post act delinquency rates by year of origination prior to by geographic region mid north mid south northeast northwest southeast southwest by commodity crops livestock permanent plantings part time farms regions are defined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
although total government payments to farmers during reached a record billion as estimated by the usda and so contributed to high levels of farm income and stable agricultural land values during the year  low commodity prices and weak demand for us agricultural products are projected to continue through farmer mac anticipates that delinquencies may increase again in  due to both the growing number of loans held or securitized by farmer mac that are gradually approaching their anticipated peak default years and the continuing stress expected in the agricultural economy 
nevertheless  based on strong agricultural income figures reported by the usda for  continued stable agricultural land values in most regions of the country  expected lower interest rates and anticipated federal financial support for agricultural producers again in  farmer mac believes that overall credit quality and sound business development opportunities remain strong 
the primary determinant of the loss that may be incurred on non performing loans is loan to value 
as of december   the weighted average loan to value ratio for all post act loans was percent  and the weighted average loan to value ratio for all post act loans that were days or more past due  in foreclosure or in bankruptcy was percent 
the following table illustrates the distribution of non performing loans at december  by loan to value based on current loan balance and appraised value at the date of initial guarantee by farmer mac distribution of post act delinquencies by loan to value ratio to to to to to total farmer mac maintains a reserve to cover potential credit losses on post act loans underlying farmer mac i securities and ltspcs 
as of december   farmer mac s loan loss reserve was million  compared to million at december  farmer mac s provision for losses was million for  compared to million for farmer mac incurred no direct charge offs against the loan loss reserve during the cost basis in property acquired through foreclosure and held by farmer mac at december   was  the reserve  as a percentage of outstanding post act farmer mac i loans  was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
management evaluates the adequacy of the reserve on a monthly basis and considers a number of factors  including historical charge off and recovery activity  trends in delinquencies  bankruptcies and non performing loans  trends in loan volume and the size of credit risks  current and anticipated economic conditions  the condition of agricultural segments  commodities and geographic areas experiencing or expected to experience particular economic adversities  particularly areas where farmer mac may have geographic or commodity concentrations  the degree of risk inherent in the composition of farmer mac s guaranteed portfolio  the results of quality control reviews  and underwriting standards 
to a lesser extent  farmer mac is also exposed to institutional credit risk related to issuers of agvantage bonds and other investments held by farmer mac  sellers and servicers  and interest rate contract counterparties 
agvantage bonds are general obligations of the agvantage issuers and are secured by collateral in an amount ranging from percent to percent of the bond amount 
in addition to requiring collateral  farmer mac mitigates credit risk related to agvantage bonds by evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of the agvantage issuers 
outstanding agvantage bonds totaled million at december   and million at december  the credit risk inherent in other investments held by farmer mac is mitigated by farmer mac s policy of establishing concentration limits and investing in highly rated instruments  which reduce exposure to any one counterparty 
farmer mac s policy limits the dollar amount of investments with one entity  excluding gses and agencies of the us government  to the lesser of percent of farmer mac s stockholders equity or million 
the policy also requires the entity to be rated in one of the three highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization for investments with terms greater than days and in one of the two highest rating categories for investments with terms of days or less 
as of december   farmer mac had investments comprised of commercial paper  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities outstanding with entities totaling million  of which exceeded percent of farmer mac s stockholders equity the cumulative balance of investments in such entities totaled million  but none of which exceeded percent of stockholders equity 
in addition  at december   farmer mac held million of securities issued by gses or agencies of the us government and million in money market investment accounts  with the maximum amount held in any one money market investment fund at any time during being approximately million 
the short term nature of the investment portfolio also limits farmer mac s credit risk 
as of december   percent of the investment portfolio  excluding gse and agency investments  consisted of short term highly liquid investments 
farmer mac manages institutional credit risk related to sellers and servicers by requiring such institutions to meet certain standards and by monitoring their financial condition and servicing performance 
credit risk related to interest rate contracts is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the funding needs of farmer mac s business programs are driven by the purchase of qualified loans  payment of principal and interest on farmer mac guaranteed securities and the maturities of debt 
farmer mac s primary sources of funds to meet these needs are issuances of debt obligations  principal and interest payments on mortgages underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and net operating cash flows 
because of farmer mac s regular participation in the capital markets and its status as a gse  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
farmer mac also maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents  comprised of commercial paper and other short term investments  to draw upon as necessary 
at december  and  farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
capital requirements 
the act  as amended by the act  establishes three capital standards for farmer mac minimum  critical and risk based 
the minimum capital requirement is expressed as a percentage of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations  with the critical capital requirement equal to one half of the minimum capital amount 
higher minimum and critical capital requirements were phased in over a transition period  which ended on january   when the highest level of minimum capital became applicable 
the act does not specify the required level of risk based capital 
it directs the fca to establish a risk based capital test for farmer mac  using stress test parameters set forth therein 
for a discussion of risk based capital  including the potential future impact on farmer mac of risk based capital requirements recently adopted by the fca  see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards risk based capital 
certain enforcement powers are given to the fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with the capital standards 
see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards enforcement levels 
as of december  and  farmer mac was classified as within level i the highest compliance level 
the following table sets forth farmer mac s minimum capital requirement as of december  and based on the fully phased in requirements 
december  december  capital capital amount ratio required amount ratio required dollars in thousands on balance sheet assets     outstanding balance of guaranteed mortgage securities held by others     other off balance sheet obligations   minimum capital level   actual core capital   capital surplus   based on the current minimum capital requirements established in the act  farmer mac s current capital surplus of million would support additional guarantee growth in amounts ranging from million of on balance sheet guarantees to million of off balance sheet guarantees 
furthermore  should farmer mac deem it appropriate  on balance sheet non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of billion could be replaced with on and off balance sheet program guarantees  resulting in the ability to carry additional guarantees ranging from approximately billion of on balance sheet guarantees to over billion of off balance sheet guarantees 
ultimately  farmer mac could sell on balance sheet program assets of billion in order to support further increases of on and off balance sheet program guarantees  resulting in the cumulative ability to carry an additional billion of off balance sheet guarantees 
any of these transactions would  of course  be evaluated to optimize farmer mac s return on equity and capital flexibility 
accordingly  in the opinion of management  farmer mac has sufficient capital and liquidity for the next twelve months 
other matters new accounting standards 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas became effective as of january  farmer mac is fully in compliance with sfas  the adoption of which by reporting companies was mandatory 
sfas requires derivative instruments  which farmer mac uses primarily to hedge interest rate risk  to be marked to their market values and included on the balance sheet
