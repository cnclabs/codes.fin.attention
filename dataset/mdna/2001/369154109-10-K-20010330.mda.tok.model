liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall debt capacity and ability to generate cash from operations to fund its operating and investing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  customer financing requirements  adequate bank lines of credit and financial flexibility to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
gbc s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources were internally generated cash flows  borrowings under gbc s revolving credit facilities and short term borrowings from banks 
gbc has access to various us and international credit facilities  including a multicurrency revolving credit facility established on january  the revolving credit facility with a group of international banks which provide for up to million of revolving credit borrowings through january the revolving credit facility was amended and restated on november  to provide gbc with additional financial flexibility 
management believes  but there can be no assurance  that the amended facility will provide gbc with the liquidity necessary to meet currently anticipated operating and capital requirements 
during  gbc will be required to renegotiate its long term revolving credit agreement with its bank group 
management believes  but there can be no assurance  that the company will be able to negotiate a new revolving credit facility with a comparable or reduced line of credit  and with terms that will approximate market interest rates 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million at december  under the most restrictive covenant of the revolving credit facility  gbc must meet a specified ebitda target set for the first fiscal quarter of  as well as leverage and interest coverage ratios commencing in the second fiscal quarter of the amendment and restatement also provides for more flexible covenants regarding net worth levels  the pledging of substantially all of the assets of general binding corporation and its domestic subsidiaries as collateral  and increases in interest rate spreads payable under the facility  which vary depending upon the financial performance of the company

currently  gbc is restricted from paying dividends under the terms of its revolving credit facility and therefore no dividends were paid in market risk disclosures gbc is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which may affect the results of its operations and financial condition 
gbc seeks to manage these risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments

the methods used by gbc to assess and mitigate the market risks discussed herein should not be considered projections of future events and exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a result of gbc s global activities  gbc has assets  liabilities  loans and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
from time to time  gbc utilizes a foreign exchange risk management program to manage its foreign exchange exposures to help minimize the adverse impact of currency movements 
certain loans and cash flows in the us and in foreign countries are currently hedged through foreign currency forward contracts 
the majority of gbc s exposures to currency movements are in europe  the asia pacific  canada and mexico  and the significant hedging transactions related to these areas outstanding as of december  are presented below

the remaining unrealized gains have not been reflected in gbc s financial statements 
interest rate risk management as a result of gbc s funding program for its global activities  gbc has various debt obligations that pay interest on the basis of fixed and floating rates

euro on january   a majority of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
the euro trades on currency exchanges  and the participating countries own currencies legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that these legacy currencies will no longer be available after july  the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
gbc has assessed its pricing marketing strategy in order to ensure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
gbc has also assessed its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro  and to accommodate the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
gbc s currency risk and risk management programs for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
gbc currently conducts a significant portion of its european transactions in the euro and will continue to evaluate issues involving the introduction of the euro 
based on current information and gbc s current assessment  management does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material effect on gbc s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and in june issued sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for certain derivative financial instruments and hedging activities including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts and require gbc to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair market value 
gbc will be required to implement both sfas no 
s and for its fiscal year these statements require that changes in a derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset the related results on the hedged item in the income statement to the extent the hedge is effective  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
gbc s existing derivative instruments are primarily designated as cash flow hedges  which were initiated to hedge cash flows related to future variable rate interest payments  cash flows in foreign currencies with respect to inventory purchases by gbc s foreign subsidiaries  and foreign currency cash flows related to the financing of gbc s foreign operations 
historically gbc has recorded changes in the market value of its derivatives related to the financing of its foreign operations on its balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in each reporting period 
at december  all of gbc s derivative instruments designed to hedge cash flows of future variable rate interest payments and foreign currency cash flows related to inventory purchases qualify for hedge accounting under statement if statement were to be applied to all of gbc s derivative instruments as of december   changes in the fair value of interest hedges would have increased gbc s liabilities by  with an offsetting amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  the amount of expense that would have been required to be recorded in current earnings would not have been significant 
changes in the fair value of hedges of foreign currency payments for the purchase of inventory would have increased gbc s assets by  with an offsetting amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  the amount of expense that would have been required to be recorded in current earnings would not have been significant
