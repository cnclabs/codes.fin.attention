item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its long term debt arrangements 
under its current policies  the company uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes for a portion of its debt arrangements 
taking into account the effects of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges  a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have limited effect on the net fair value of all interest sensitive financial instruments at december
