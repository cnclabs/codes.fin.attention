item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  and the related notes to financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we cannot guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development  and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses  and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information of known facts and trends 
long term strategy and business developments our long term strategy is to increase our oil and gas reserves and production while keeping our finding and development costs and production costs competitive with the industry 
the following table reflects our results during the last three years 
increase increase decrease decrease production oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    proved reserves oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    production costs per mcfe production costs per mcfe without net profits expense finding and development costs per mcfe barrels of oil are converted to mcf equivalents at the ratio of barrel of oil equals mcf of gas 
production costs include operating  transportation and net profits expense 
finding and development costs include acquisition  development and exploration costs including exploration costs such as seismic acquisition costs 
liquidity and capital resources on december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by million 
our current ratio was to 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december   before changes in working capital increased by million  or  compared to the prior year primarily because of increased oil and gas revenues 
gas sales increased by million  or  and oil sales increased by million  or 
the increase in gas sales relates to a increase in production million and a increase in gas prices million  and the increase in oil revenues relates primarily to a increase in oil prices 
the recent increase in oil and gas prices has a positive impact on total revenues  net income  and cash flow from operations 
based on this increase and an expected increase in production  our current projections indicate that we can finance the majority of our planned capital expenditures in through our cash flow from operations 
we incurred capital and exploration expenditures totaling million during the capital expenditures included drilling successful exploration wells in the gulf of mexico and successful wells in mississippi and south texas 
in addition we built and installed two offshore platforms and drilled successful development wells in the gulf of mexico  acquired rights to an additional  blocks of seismic data  and drilled successful development wells in south texas and mississippi 
in july  we sold certain non operated producing properties located in nueces  starr  and victoria counties  texas  for approximately million 
we recorded a million gain from the sale 
we used the cash received from the sale of these properties to fund a portion of our operated projects in the gulf of mexico and new property acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in our capital and exploration budget includes million for exploration  million for development  and million for land and seismic costs 
we expect that our cash  estimated future cash flow from operations  and available bank line of credit will be adequate to fund the capital budget for the remainder of this year 
our current bank line of credit has a borrowing base of million 
the bank reviews the borrowing base semi annually and may increase or decrease the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit 
additionally  we have agreed not to pay dividends 
in september  the bank agreed to extend the final maturity date from march   to march   and the availability date from october   to october  we cannot borrow additional funds after the availability date 
in addition  on that date  the revolving credit loans convert to term loans  which must be amortized in equal quarterly principal payments through the final maturity date unless the agreement is amended 
on december   we had million of unused borrowing base available on the line of credit 
remington s stock price increased by during the year from a low closing price of per share on february   to a high closing price of per share on december  the closing price has remained above per share throughout the first quarter of in  as a long term incentive  the board of directors approved a contingent stock grant of  shares of our common stock to the employees and directors of the company 
we made this grant when it was difficult to attract and retain quality employees and directors due to the ongoing litigation with phillips petroleum company and our lack of a track record at the time 
we have lost no employees or directors since initiating the program 
the number of shares granted each employee and director is relative to the employee s salary or base number in the case of directors and the closing stock price per share on june  in order for the grant to become effective  the price of our stock had to increase from per share to per share and close at or above per share for consecutive trading days 
the required increase in the stock price represented the equivalent of a compounded annual rate of return of for five years 
since one participant voluntarily surrendered  shares  and the board approved an additional grant of  shares to a new participant 
the grant became effective on january   when our stock price closed above the trigger price of per share for the twentieth consecutive trading day 
as a result of the stock grant becoming effective  we will recognize non cash compensation expense totaling million 
in the first quarter of we will recognize a catch up expense of million 
the remaining million will be amortized quarterly over the next years as the shares vest to the employees and directors 
during the last three years we have not recorded a significant amount of federal income tax expense on our income statement 
we had a net deferred income tax benefit recorded as an asset on our balance sheet against which we also recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred benefit during those years 
during and as we recorded net income  we recorded a deferred income tax expense but offset the amount to zero by a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance 
because of our net income during we will almost fully utilize the deferred income tax benefit and the corresponding valuation allowance 
therefore  beginning in the first quarter of we expect that we will begin recording deferred income tax expense equal to approximately of our income before taxes 
we expect our cash income tax expense  primarily alternative minimum tax  will be between and of our income before taxes 
results of operations in  we recorded net income totaling million or basic income per share  and diluted income per share  compared to a net loss of million or basic and diluted income per share in the increase in net income resulted primarily from higher revenues because of the increased gas production  increased oil and gas prices  and the sale of certain south texas properties in the following table discloses the net oil and gas production volumes  sales  and sales prices for each of the three years ended december    and the table is an integral part of the following discussion of results of operations for the periods compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease oil production volume mbbls    oil sales revenue    price per bbl increase decrease in oil sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume  total increase decrease in oil sales revenue   gas production volume mmcf    gas sales revenue    price per mcf increase decrease in gas sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume   total increase decrease in gas sales revenue   compared to oil production increased slightly compared to because of increased production from mississippi partially offset by lower oil production from the gulf of mexico 
oil production from mississippi increased by  barrels  or  during because of several new successful wells drilled during the year 
the average oil price increased by during compared to the prior year 
gas production increased by during compared to primarily from gas produced from the gulf of mexico and south texas 
gas production from the gulf of mexico increased by bcf  or  and gas production from south texas increased by  mcf  or during the increase resulted from several successful wells drilled during the year 
the average gas price increased by during compared to other income increased by million because we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain south texas properties in august  partially offset by lower oil trading income 
operating expenses increased during the year compared to  mainly due to the increased number of producing properties and an increase in workover expenses mostly related to west cameron and eugene island exploration expense increased by  during primarily because of slightly higher dry hole costs in the current year 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense increased by  during compared to the prior year largely as a result of increased production partially offset by lower finding costs per unit during the last three years 
impairment expense for the year primarily includes the costs for expired unproved properties compared to impairment expense for the year that included additional impairments for main pass and two small onshore properties 
legal expenses decreased  or mainly because of lower costs related to the phillips litigation 
we settled all of the minerals management service issues and the minority stockholders litigation during the year 
we reached two separate accords with the minerals management service concerning the alleged underpayment of oil and gas royalties 
the first agreement  reached in may  concerned additional royalties asserted to be due on the settlement of litigation concerning a gas sales contract 
because of this agreement  we recorded an expense of million in the first quarter of as to the second accord  we reached an agreement in october to settle the issues concerning oil transportation charges and oil exchange contracts for million 
compared to oil revenue increased by million in compared to the prior year primarily because of the increase in the average price 
oil production from the three gulf of mexico platforms in the south pass area decreased mbbls because of depletion of reserves from existing wells 
however  oil production from other gulf of mexico properties increased by mbbls and partially offset the decrease from the south pass area 
in addition  oil production from mississippi increased by approximately mbbls 
the net reduction in oil production decreased total oil revenues by  gas revenues for increased by million largely because of the increase in gas production 
gas production from the offshore gulf of mexico increased by approximately bcf 
gas production from the south texas gulf coast increased by approximately bcf 
these volume increases  which resulted in about million in additional revenue  were substantially offset by lower unit prices  which reduced revenues by approximately million 
the average price decreased because during the first half of we sold gas produced from south pass block under a gas sales contract at above market prices 
we terminated the gas contract in july interest income decreased  because of lower cash and investments balances throughout compared to other income decreased because in august we received million from texas eastern transmission corporation to terminate the south pass block gas sales contract 
operating expenses increased by million  or  because of the increase in the number of producing properties during transportation expenses decreased because we purchased s sixteen holding company in december we eliminated the transportation expense in the consolidation of ckb petroleum  inc net profits expense decreased million because of lower production volumes and the termination of the texas eastern gas sales contract in july the termination of the gas sales contract caused gas revenues from south pass block to decrease significantly 
exploration expenses decreased by million  or  because of lower dry hole costs and lower d seismic costs incurred during compared to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased because of an increase in the number of producing properties and an increase in production 
however  because our per unit finding and development costs decreased  our per unit depreciation  depletion and amortization amounts decreased 
in  impairment of oil and gas properties decreased million from the prior year 
in we recorded a million impairment charge on the south pass block property as a result of the termination of the gas sales contract 
during the third quarter of  we received a judgment against us for million in the phillips litigation 
we recorded the judgment during the third quarter of and have continued to record interest on the judgment amount 
in february  we reached an agreement to settle litigation with the two minority shareholders of ckb associates  inc and ckb petroleum  inc 
in addition  as part of the settlement agreement  we purchased their minority interest in the two subsidiaries in march we recorded the estimated expense portion of the settlement as a charge against income in the fourth quarter of phillips petroleum litigation in  phillips petroleum company assigned its interest in south pass  offshore louisiana  to okc limited partnership  predecessor to remington oil and gas corporation 
the assignment was accomplished through a farmout agreement in which phillips retained a net profits interest 
phillips had obtained  through a predecessor corporation  the lease from the minerals management service  which only granted rights to oil and gas from production 
paragraph iv of the farmout states that phillips net profits shall be thirty three percent of one fourth of eight eighths of production 
paragraph iv a states that phillips shall look exclusively to the oil  gas  condensate  and other hydrocarbons  
produced from the subject lease for the satisfaction and realization of the net profits interest 
subparagraph iv d states the net profits account shall be credited with an amount equal to the proceeds of all judgments and claims collected on account of its ownership of the subject lease 
subparagraph iv d states the net profits account shall be credited with an amount equal to all monies and things of value received by or inuring to the benefit by virtue of its ownership interest in the subject lease of remington 
the interpretation of paragraph iv and its subparagraphs has been the primary subject of the recent litigation between phillips and us 
our claim  upheld by the trial court and the appellate court  is that phillips can look only to actual production for satisfaction of the net profits interest according to the clear language of paragraph iv 
it is our position that subparagraphs iv d and merely define types of production to be credited to the net profits account 
phillips claims that subparagraphs iv d and should stand alone and not as subsets of paragraph iv and entitle phillips to amounts received by us regardless of whether they represent revenues from or associated with production from the lease 
we believe that if phillips  as drafter of the farmout agreement  intended subparagraphs iv d and to be so controlling  no reference to production would have been necessary in the farmout 
the current litigation between phillips and us involves three issues related to the interpretation of paragraph iv and its subparagraphs the tetco issue  the overriding royalty issue  and the pipeline tariff issue detailed below 
tetco we entered into a gas purchase agreement with tetco in dedicating our gas from south pass to tetco for specified prices 
in  tetco sued us claiming the contract was terminated 
in november of  we settled with tetco and received million to settle all causes of action  claims and controversies between them pertaining to the litigation 
furthermore  we agreed to a new contract price for gas sold to tetco in exchange for its agreement to drop its legal challenges to the gas contract 
tetco also paid us an additional million over and above the million for past production which we credited to the net profits account 
this payment has not been subject to any litigation 
in may of  we allocated million of the million as production to the net profits account 
phillips claims the remaining million should have been credited to the net profits account 
after a three week trial in  the louisiana trial court ruled that we should have credited million to the net profits account as proceeds from production and thus owed an additional million plus interest to phillips 
as part of its ruling  the trial court supported our claim that phillips could only look to actual production for its net profits interest and that the remaining million of the tetco payment was for settlement of remington s counterclaims against tetco 
phillips appealed this ruling and on december   the court of appeal upheld the trial court s opinion 
overriding royalty phillips claimed that in months when no net profits are achieved  its net profits interest should revert to an overriding royalty 
we claimed that once net profits are achieved  phillips net profits interest does not revert to an overriding royalty until cumulative net profits are depleted 
the trial court ruled in phillips favor and awarded phillips million plus interest 
we appealed this issue  but the appellate court upheld the trial court s ruling 
we will not appeal the issue further 
pipeline tariff the farmout agreement allows transportation costs to be charged to the net profits account 
initially  marathon constructed and operated the oil pipeline from the south pass complex to venice  louisiana  and charged us a tariff of per barrel for transportation 
this tariff was charged to the net profits account with no complaint from phillips from inception of production in until in  ckb petroleum  inc purchased an interest in the pipeline and entered into a year transportation agreement with us to transport all of our oil for per barrel 
before ckb petroleum purchased its interest  phillips was given the right to purchase the interest under a preferential right clause of the pipeline operating agreement  but declined to do so 
phillips claims that we should charge only a lesser amount which phillips claims was our actual cost of transportation not what we paid to ckb petroleum  inc 
phillips has tried to claim that we somehow profited from charging the net profits account with the tariff amount that we paid to ckb petroleum 
such a charge was clearly permitted by the farmout agreement 
the trial court dismissed this claim 
on december   the court of appeal upheld the trial court s opinion on this issue 
the per barrel tariff has been the market rate for the pipeline for us and our partners from inception through the trial date 
the total judgment awarded by the trial court in including interest was million 
we recorded an million charge to income in the third quarter of and continue to accrue interest on this liability each quarter 
the present total liability is million 
currently  we have million in restricted cash set aside for this litigation 
phillips has filed an application for a supervisory writ with the louisiana supreme court to which we have filed a response 
in the application phillips has presented no new facts and no new issues of policy  law or equity 
the supreme court may refuse to hear the case 
if the supreme court grants the application it will  in all probability  be several months before the case is briefed and heard by the supreme court on the merits and possibly several more months before a decision rendered 
after the supreme court issues a final ruling on the case  or refuses to hear the case  it is likely  depending on the ruling  that various elements will be remanded to the trial court to resolve certain technical issues in accordance with the court rulings 
it may take several months to resolve these issues in the trial court 
when the litigation is concluded and the amount of our liability is finally determined  we intend to use a combination of cash  debt financing  and or property sales to fulfill the amount of any judgment 
we believe that there will be sufficient time from final determination by the appellate court of last resort and a final determination by the trial court on remand to allow us to make provision for any required payment 
final resolution of this matter through the courts may take up to several years 
in august of  we terminated the tetco gas contract and received million 
phillips has claimed that this full million payment should be credited to the net profits account 
litigation on this issue was initiated in collin county  texas  and subsequently stayed pending the resolution of all the appeals in phillips louisiana suit 
based on the trial court and appellate court opinions stating that phillips can look only to production for its net profits interest  we anticipate that this case will be dismissed or resolved through summary proceedings 
total liability for this claim would be million plus statutory interest until the date of settlement 
the trial and any appeals regarding this issue  if necessary  could take an additional two years to resolve once the current louisiana litigation is concluded 
we have settled similar issues with the minerals management service 
on a pro rata basis  such settlements are for amounts that are significantly lower than the amounts claimed by phillips  and also lower than the amounts awarded by the courts 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as amended  the statement is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  january  for us 
sfas no 
requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in the income statement in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the income statement when the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the definition of derivatives has also been expanded to include contracts that require physical delivery of oil and gas if the contract allows for net cash settlement 
currently we do not utilize any derivative instruments that fall under the criteria defined in the accounting standard 
accordingly  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our reported financial statements or disclosures 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin  which provides guidance on applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to revenue recognition  does not have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk sensitive instrument at december   is a revolving line of credit from a bank 
at december   the unpaid principal balance under the line was million 
the interest rate on this debt is sensitive to market fluctuations  however we do not believe that significant fluctuations in the market interest have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow from operations
