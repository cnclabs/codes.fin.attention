item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus

unico has a  line of credit with union bank of california 
interest on this line is referenced to libor and is payable monthly 
the agreement contains certain covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios 
this credit line expires september   at which time it is expected to be renewed 
unico did not borrow against its line of credit in or although material capital expenditures may also be funded through borrowings  the company believes that its cash and short term investments at year end  net of trust restriction of  statutory deposits of  and dividend restriction between crusader and unico see item business insurance company operation holding company act plus the cash to be generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next twelve months without the necessity of borrowing funds

there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of the date of this report 
results of operations general the company had net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income before taxes decreased by  and net income decreased by  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
for the year ended december   income before taxes decreased by  and net income decreased by  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the year ended december   was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows year ended december gross written premium    net written premium net of reinsurance ceded    earned premium before reinsurance ceded    earned premium net of reinsurance ceded    losses and loss adjustment expenses    unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    crusader s primary line of business is commercial multiple peril business package policies 
this line of business represented approximately of crusader s total written premium for both fiscal years ended december  and crusader s gross written premium by state is as follows year ended december california    arizona    washington    ohio    pennsylvania    oregon    montana    texas    nevada    idaho  kentucky    total gross written premium    for the year ended december   gross written premium increased by  compared to the year ended december  the company believes that the slight growth in written premium in is the result of a subsidence in the intensity of price based competition in the property casualty insurance market 
for the year ended december   gross written premium decreased by  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was due to intense price competition that adversely affected the premium written in nearly all states that the company does business 
although the company attempts to be competitive on price  it believes that maintaining adequate rates on the insurance policies it sells is a better business strategy than increasing total written premium by selling more policies at inadequate rates 
this business philosophy has resulted in decreased written premium in and virtually no premium growth in although it appears that the intensity of price based competition has somewhat subsided  the company does not believe that it is in a hard market 
while some of its competitors have recently raised rates or adopted more restrictive rules  those changes have not yet been large enough to redirect the flow of new business to the company 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
the company continues to believe that it can compete effectively and profitably by offering better service and by marketing its policies through its current independent agents and brokers 
in pursuing its growth plan  the company adopted a geographic expansion plan several years ago 
in  of the company s sales were in california 
as of december   the company had established marketing relations and products in ten other states  decreasing the percentage of its california business to 
the company has no short term plan to expand into additional states  nor to expand upon its marketing channels 
however  the company does plan to adopt fine tuning changes to its existing rates  rules and forms  and it plans to add new programs for the states where it currently operates 
currently  agents and brokers who call for quotes on policies sold by the company may also have to call competitors for quotes on products which the company does not offer 
thus  crusader competes with not only other insurance companies  but with general agents who produce business for other insurance companies 
many of these general agents offer more products than the company and thus make it easier for the agents and brokers because they can do more business with fewer telephone calls 
to provide better service to the company s agents and brokers  the company is currently working on additional non affiliated insurance company products to be offered by its general agency operations 
in addition to generating additional commission and fee income  the expansion of the general agency operations may benefit crusader because agents and brokers may place more of their business with crusader 
the company writes annual policies and therefore earns written premium over the one year policy term 
premium earned before reinsurance decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in earned premium before reinsurance was directly related to the decrease in written premium discussed above

premium ceded under this contract  which was canceled on a runoff basis effective december   is subject to adjustments based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that can be charged by the reinsurer 
the decrease in earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium in  and was primarily due to decreased earned premium before reinsurance 
the following table shows the changes in ceded premium year ended december decrease in earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium    increase in provisionally rated ceded premium    net increase decrease in earned ceded premium    the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition and general operating costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as shown on the table below  the loss ratio increased to in from in this increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to a decreased earned premium before reinsurance discussed above  an increase in earned premium ceded discussed above  and an increase in incurred losses on prior years 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio during  as part of the company s ongoing reserve review process and loss trending analysis  the company determined that its average claim costs were increasing and claims were settling for amounts greater than had been anticipated 
to address this trend  the company reviewed its open claim files to ensure that its case reserves and ibnr were adequate 
the review process took approximately one year and resulted in increased reserves 
the increase in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses recognized in and was primarily due to the following higher than anticipated claim cost from business outside of california 
the effect on settlements of escalating jury awards increased development of losses due to the impact of changes in california law that expanded coverage and increased loss exposure  eg  montrose chemical corp

as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
since inception of the company  only ten bonds have been sold prior to their maturity or call date 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements are unrealized  and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect

this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities are sold 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk 
due to the company s small investment in equity securities approximately one half of one percent of total invested assets  the company has only minimal exposure to equity price risk
