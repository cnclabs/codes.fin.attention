years ended september  traffic safety    percentage of revenues survey and mapping    percentage of revenues industrial controls    percentage of revenues consumer    percentage of revenues total revenues    fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were  compared to  realized during the fiscal year ended september   representing a decrease 
in  significant decreases in our foreign traffic safety and domestic survey mapping sales had the greatest impact on total revenues 
these decreases offset increases in consumer product sales consisting of sales of the new asic 
sales of our traffic safety products decreased from  in to  in north american traffic safety product sales increased from  in to  in  primarily due to a growing maturity of the sales force producing greater revenue per salesperson 
international traffic safety product sales decreased from  in to  in international sales were hurt by a continued strong dollar  which made the prices of foreign products more competitive 
overall sales of our survey and mapping products decreased from  in to  in north american survey and mapping product sales decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to delay in product availability  purchased component quality problems and an economic slowdown 
international sales of our survey and mapping products decreased from  in to  in international sales were negatively impacted by the strong dollar and increased competition that now has reflectorless capabilities in their products 
international sales in were  compared to  realized in sales internationally comprised approximately of our total revenues in compared to of total revenues in gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to for the decrease in gross profit margins in was primarily due to increased material cost and decreased output on the production line 
royalty income earned in is derived primarily from our agreement with bushnell for sales of the yardage pro series of consumer laser range finders 
royalty income increased approximately from  in to  in the increase during was due primarily to the introduction of the new yardage pro sport into the bushnell product line and increased sales into the professional markets 
total operating expenses decreased approximately from  in to  in the decrease is attributed to lower sales  marketing and administrative expenses coupled with the reimbursement of research and development costs from third parties 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase for legal expenses associated with prosecuting the patent infringement claims 
decreased operating expenses combined with the increase in royalties and other income in resulted in a net income for the year 
income before taxes of  in compared to  in after taxes on income  we realized a net income of  or 
basic earnings per share in compared to net income of  or 
basic earnings per share in fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were  compared to  realized during the fiscal year ended september   representing a increase 
in  significant increases in our traffic safety and consumer product sales had the greatest impact on total revenues 
these increases helped offset decreases in survey and mapping and industrial product sales 
sales of our traffic safety products increased from  in to  in domestic traffic safety product sales decreased from  in to  in primarily due to the reallocation of state funding in the southeast region 
international traffic safety product sales increased from  in to  in due to increased implementation of laser products as government agencies have realized the positive benefits resulting from the use of the ultralyte series of lasers 
the recent approval for use of the ultralyte in several countries allows distributors to order our speed measurement products for use as a mainstream traffic enforcement tool rather than just evaluation and homologation purposes 
overall sales of our survey and mapping products decreased in to  from  in domestic survey and mapping product sales increased to  in from  in primarily due to a restructuring of the segment s sales force  providing improved service and support to domestic dealers and a stronger presence at trade shows 
international sales of our survey and mapping products decreased from  in to  in international sales were negatively impacted by the strong dollar  the delay in the recovery of the asian economy  the discontinuation of the criterion laser series and increased competition in europe 
international sales of our products in were  compared to  realized in sales internationally comprised approximately of our total revenues in compared to of total revenues in gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to for the increase in gross profit margins in was primarily due to a more profitable product mix 
increased profitability was due to improving sales of second generation products such as the ultralyte series  increased output on the production line and a reduction in specific materials cost 
royalty income in is derived primarily from our agreement with bushnell for sales of the yardage pro series of consumer laser range finders 
royalty income increased approximately to  in from  in the increase during was due primarily to a stabilization of the bushnell product line  along with the exit of some market competitors 
management believes that royalty income received from our current licensing arrangements will continue to positively impact our operations 
total operating expenses decreased approximately to  in from  in the decrease is attributed to lower executive  administrative and legal expenses associated with the absence of litigation  a reduction in staff and improvements in operational processes to increase efficiency 
litigation related costs incurred in were related to the class action lawsuits and sec investigation 
the litigation and sec matters were substantially resolved during and those costs were not expected to be repeated in although  was expensed in operating profit before legal and severance costs associated with restructuring of management and employees was equal to  increased sales and gross profit margins combined with the decrease in operating and litigation related expenses in resulted in a net income for the year 
combined with income earned on investments of  and  in and  respectively  we realized an income before taxes of  in compared to loss before taxes of  in after taxes on income  we realized a net income of  or 
basic earnings per share in compared to net loss of  or 
basic loss per share in foreign sales foreign sales of our products were  and for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
management believes that our foreign sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of revenues 
we require that all international sales be paid for with us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products less competitive in those markets 
research and development costs research and development costs related to the continual development of our products are expensed as incurred and included in operating expenses 
research and development costs totaled approximately   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
year to year increases in research and development expenditures are primarily attributable to increased product development and investments in pure research to provide for significant future technology and product advancements 
the ability to recoup research and development costs from third parties decreased our expense in management anticipates a continued commitment to research and development as the engineering department is positioned to support and facilitate future growth 
cost associated with our patents are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life of to years 
patent costs capitalized totaled approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
income taxes our policy is to provide deferred income taxes related to inventories and other items that result in differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and a net operating loss carryforward 
as a result  at september   we recorded a deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources our net working capital at september  was  as compared to working capital of  at september   an increase of  the increase is primarily related to an increase in inventory 
current assets exceeded current liabilities by a ratio of to furthermore  the acid test ratio ratio of current assets minus inventories and prepaid expenses to liabilities was in excess of to thus  the present working capital is expected to adequately meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
inventory  the largest item that required financing  stood at  at september   up  from september  inventory expansion reflected stocking of certain outsourced assemblies and an increase in other raw materials 
prepaid insurance  fees and expenses required an additional  of funding 
the operating activities that provided cash were a net income of  depreciation and amortization of  and a reduction in accounts receivable and bad debt of  the only other items that reduced cash were a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  for the year ended september   a net cash increase of  from investing activities was due to the conversion of investment accounts into working capital 
after expending  on operating activities and  on long term debt and capital leases  there was a net decrease in cash and equivalents of  when added to cash on hand at the beginning of the twelve month period  total cash and equivalents at september  stood at  thus  cash and equivalents alone comfortably exceeded total liabilities of  at the end of the period 
for the year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was  net income of  a reduction of receivables and bad debt of  and deferred taxes of  together with depreciation and amortization of  offset the increase in inventories of  and net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  cash used in investing activities in of  was primarily used for the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of  purchase of investments of  and  used for capitalization of patent costs 
this result was partially offset with proceeds from investment maturities of  and sale of property equipment of  for fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased for the year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was  this was due primarily to i reductions in accounts receivable of  and inventories of  and ii increases to accruals primarily related to the pending litigation settlement of  this result was partially offset by the net loss for the year of  cash used in investing activities of  resulted from increased cash from investment maturities of  primarily used for the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of  also   was used to protect our proprietary technology 
for the year ended september  cash and cash equivalents decreased  other in november  we leased an additional  square feet adjacent to our facilities under our lease agreement 
to complete our expansion in fiscal  we spent approximately  in leasehold improvements 
we believe that our current and planned facilities are adequate to meet our needs throughout the foreseeable future 
in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations  all of our foreign sales are made in us currency 
we generally enforce the use of letters of credit and wire transfers in most of our credit arrangements with most foreign distributors to reduce the risk of uncollected accounts receivable 
in  in conjunction with a review of the accounts receivable balances  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to  to address some potential collectibility issues with some of our foreign accounts that were not sold using letters of credit 
in fiscal we decreased our accrual for doubtful accounts to  to cover the risk of uncollectable accounts receivable 
effect of inflation we believe that we will experience increased costs due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  material and supplies  and equipment acquisitions 
however  such inflationary effects are not expected to have a material impact on our revenues  gross profit or results of operations for at least the next twelve months 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  was adopted as of april  we believe the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocatable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimatable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we adopted sfas upon issuance and sfas effective april  the adoption of sfas and did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
on august   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  it requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
upon initially recognizing an accrued retirement obligation  an entity must capitalize the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
although we have not completed the process of determining the effect of this new accounting pronouncement  we currently expect that the effect of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements  when it becomes effective  will not be significant 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
although sfas supersedes sfas  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of  by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners  or is classified as held for sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements
