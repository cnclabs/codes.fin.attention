item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income after provision for possible loan losses  its revenue from other banking services and non interest expenses 
net interest income depends upon the net interest rate spread between the yield on the loan and investment portfolios and the cost of funds  consisting primarily of interest expense on deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
the interest rate spread is affected by the match between the maturities or repricing intervals of interest bearing assets and liabilities  the mix and composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  economic factors influencing general interest rates  prepayment on loans and mortgage backed investments  loan demand and savings flows  as well as the effect of competition for deposits and loans 
net interest income is also affected by the performance of the loan portfolio  amortization on accretion of premiums or discounts on purchased loans or mortgage backed securities and the level of non earning assets 
revenues from loan fees and other banking services depend upon the volume of new transactions and the market level of prices for competitive products and services 
non interest expenses depend upon the efficiency of the company s internal operations and general market and economic conditions 
in august  the company opened  in cohasset  the first of five planned de novo supermarket branches  with the randolph april and hanson september branches opening in  brockton may opening in and canton opening in november this expansion of the company s community banking business into supermarket banking is consistent with the company s strategy of controlled growth with a focus on core retail deposit relationships and will enable the company to have a greater regional presence

ocm is headquartered in brockton  and has origination offices in plymouth  fall river and auburn massachusetts as well as a presence in each of the company s branches 
this acquisition was made to expand the company s mortgage origination capabilities from what they were previously as well as to provide the company with a greater diversity of sources of income

net interest income net interest income is affected by the mix and volume of assets and liabilities  and levels of prepayment primarily on loans and mortgage backed investments  the movement and level of interest rates  and interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield received on earning assets and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net interest rate spread was and for the years ended december  and the level of non accrual loans and other real estate owned can have an impact on net interest income but has been immaterial in and at december   the company had  in non accrual loans and no other real estate owned compared to  in non accrual loans and no other real estate owned as of december  the table on the following page presents average balances  interest income and expense and average yields earned or rates paid on the major categories of assets and liabilities for the years indicated

or on a per diluted share basis 
the overall increase in net income was mainly attributable to increases in net interest income and customer service fees and decreases in the provision for possible loan losses  offset in part by increases in non interest expense 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income increased  or during  as compared to the increase was attributable to increases in earning assets and  to a lesser degree  increases in the yield earned on those assets 
the balance of average earning assets for was approximately  as compared to  in  an overall increase of  or 
the increase in earning assets was  in part  due to increases in average loan balances which were  for  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase in balances was generally caused by larger volumes of commercial loan originations in and into as well as higher residential loan balances which were the result of loan originations purchases throughout and into see liquidity and capital resources and asset liability management for further discussion of the company s loan purchasing and investment strategies 
the average yield earned on loans increased slightly to for from for loan yields in were affected by increases in the yields on loans originated purchased in the second half of and into yields on loans were also positively affected by growth in the company s commercial loan portfolio including commercial real estate and construction which grew to approximately  at december  from  at december   an increase of  or

average balances of mortgage backed investments and bond investment securities were  and  respectively  for as compared to  and  respectively  for the corresponding period in these balances  when combined  increased  or 
the yields on mortgage backed investments and bond investment securities rose to and  respectively  in  from and  respectively  in this was generally due to the acquisition of higher yielding securities over the past year 
during  management has strategically acquired generally aaa rated  mortgage backed and investment securities in lieu of aggressively purchasing residential loans in order to provide the company with better overall yields without sacrificing credit quality 
these investments were also deemed by management to be a better fit for the balance sheet for asset liability purposes 
interest expense interest expense for increased  or compared to  generally due to increases in the average balances of deposits and borrowed funds as well as the rates paid on time deposits and borrowed funds 
the average balance of core and time deposits rose to  and  respectively  for as compared to  and  respectively  in  for increases of and  respectively 
the increases noted for as compared to relates to the attractiveness of the company s retail products and services in the marketplace it serves as well as reflecting some of the fallout from recent in market bank merger activity which displaced many customers who sought an alternative to their prior banking relationship primarily in the first half of this has been beneficial to the company as well as many other community banks in the region 
the company will continue to closely manage its cost of deposits by continuing to seek methods of acquiring new core deposits and maintaining its current core deposits while prudently adding time deposits at reasonable rates in comparison to local markets and other funding alternatives  including borrowings 
the average balances of borrowed funds increased overall during as compared to  to  from  an increase of 
these increased borrowings were used to fund earning asset growth over the past year 
the blended weighted average rate paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds was for as compared to in the overall weighted average rates paid on borrowed funds increased to approximately in from in this increase is reflective of the net cumulative effect of actions taken by the federal reserve between july and august of to increase the inter bank borrowing rate by basis points 
in january  the federal reserve reduced the interbank borrowing rate by basis points in response to a perceived economic slowdown with many economists speculating further reductions 
such reductions  if sustained  should have the effect of decreasing the cost of borrowed funds short term and maturing long term and time deposits 
the company will continue to evaluate the use of borrowing as an alternative funding source for asset growth in future periods 
see asset liability management for further discussion of the competitive market for deposits and overall strategies for uses of borrowed funds 
the weighted average rates paid on interest bearing deposits was in as compared to in the overall cost of deposits has increased primarily due to market competition for time deposits 
the level of competitive rates for time deposits in was consistent with the desire of many banks in the marketplace to attract new customers in a period of significant consumer disruption see earlier discussion of in market bank merger activity 
the company s cost of time deposits rose to in from in the overall impact on the cost of deposits was mitigated by the company s continued success in attracting core deposits ddas  nows  savings and money markets through its retail and promotional efforts during the year despite overall increases in economic rates and other competitive factors 
non interest income total non interest income increased  or in in comparison to customer service fees  which were  in as compared to  for  for an increase of  or  rose primarily due to growth in deposit accounts  primarily now and checking account portfolios 
also  in may  the company was granted regulatory approval to sell insurance annuities 
this and other brokerage related activities accounted for approximately  of the aforementioned increase in customer service fees 
loan servicing fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans were  and  respectively  in as compared to  and  respectively  in  a combined increase of  or 
the increase in loan gains for as compared to is generally reflective of the expanded capacity and actual residential mortgage originations and sales as the result of old colony mortgage which was included in the consolidated results of operations for months in as compared to months in as the company has been selling loans generally on a servicing released basis since  the portfolio of loans serviced for others has declined which has caused the continued drop in loan servicing income 
gains on sales of securities were  in as compared to  in for a decrease of  or 
the decrease in gains on securities in is reflective of management s decision to sell fewer securities for gains in as compared to non interest expenses non interest expenses for increased  or compared to included in this increase in was approximately  of non capitalizable  identifiable and quantifiable non recurring expenses which related to the company s conversion of its computer systems from an in house mainframe to a third party service bureau 
this expense was spread across various categories and is noted in the analyses below 
salaries and employee benefits increased or  primarily due to the acquisition of old colony mortgage in april approximately  increases related to branches opened brockton in may and canton november approximately  the conversion of computer systems to an outside service bureau  increases in commissions particularly commissions on insurance sales and estimates related to various other incentive compensation accruals  and other general increases in salaries  commissions paid and customer service related staff levels 
these increases correspond with the company s strategic focus of attracting core deposits and new customer relationships 
management also believes that a portion of the salaries expense increase  not previously specifically identified  is attributable to post conversion activity which has had a temporary impact on increasing overtime hours worked and overall staffing levels 
additionally  these increases are net of a curtailment gain of  which was the result of management s decision to freeze october  and terminate december  its pension plan 
this was recorded as a reduction in salaries and benefits expense in the fourth quarter of occupancy expenses decreased  or primarily due to the expiration of maintenance contracts on the company s prior mainframe system 
these decreases are net of the effect of increases relating to the acquisition of old colony mortgage approximately  the canton and brockton branches as previously noted approximately  and the system conversion 
other non interest expenses  including trust preferred expenses  also increased  or for in comparison to the aforementioned increases relates to the acquisition of old colony mortgage  the brockton and canton branches  the systems conversion  and service contracts on new computer system  in in addition to other inflationary and volume related increases 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses for was  as compared to  in the lower levels of provision is generally attributable to continued strength and improvements in other asset quality factors  such as delinquency  charge offs  non performing and watched assets that management uses to measure and evaluate the adequacy of loan loss reserve levels 
the resulting level of loan loss reserves were approximately of period end loans at december  as compared to 
at december  however  ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates and increased provisions in future periods may be necessary 
provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for was compared to in the lower effective tax rate in comparison to statutory rates for both periods is reflective of income earned by certain non bank subsidiaries which are taxed  for state tax purposes  at lower rates 
comparison of the years ended december  and general net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share compared to a net income of  or per diluted share in  a net decrease of  or 
earnings on a per diluted share basis increased in over as a result of the company s repurchase of shares under current buy back plans 
the overall decline in net income was mainly attributable to lower gains on sales of securities and increases in non interest expenses  including salaries expense and trust preferred securities  offset in part by increases in net interest income  customer service fees and gains on sales of mortgages 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income increased  or during  as compared to the increase was attributable to increases in earning assets offset in part by reductions in the yield earned on those assets 
the balance of average earning assets for was approximately  as compared to  in  an overall increase of  or 
the increase in earning assets was in part due to increases in average loan balances which were  for  as compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was generally caused by larger volumes of commercial loan originations in and into as well as higher residential loan balances which were the result of the steady volume of loan originations and purchases throughout and into see liquidity and capital resources and asset liability management for further discussion of the company s investment strategies 
the average yield earned on loans decreased in as compared to primarily due to the effect of higher prepayments on higher yielding residential loans and lower rates earned on newer originations or purchases 
the yield on loans for was as compared to in loan yields in were affected by consistently high levels of prepayment activity experienced throughout into on higher yielding residential loans which were in turn replaced by lower yielding loans as a result of market conditions in and as compared to loans which were originated prior to yields on loans were positively affected by growth in the company s commercial loan portfolio including commercial real estate and construction loans which has grown to approximately  at december  from  at december   an increase of  or

the yield on mortgage backed investments and bond investments declined to and respectively in  as compared to and  respectively in as with loan yields  these yields were adversely affected by general rate declines and prepayments on higher yielding securities over the previous two years 
also  the yield on bond investments decreased generally due to some of the company s higher yielding bonds being called by the issuers with proceeds being reinvested at lower rates 
interest expense interest expense for increased  or compared to  generally due to increases in the average balances of deposits and borrowed funds  which was partially offset by decreases in the rates paid on deposit and borrowed funds 
the average balance of core and time deposits rose to  and  respectively  for as compared to  and  respectively  in  for increases of and  respectively 
the average balances of borrowed funds increased overall  during as compared to  to  from  an increase of 
this increase generally related to the funding of asset growth 
the blended weighted average rate paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds was for as compared to in the weighted average rates paid on deposits was for as compared to in the overall cost of deposits has declined in as compared to  generally due to the continued success of promotional efforts to attract core deposits now accounts  demand deposits  savings and money markets  which typically have a lower cost of funds than time deposits and borrowings 
the overall weighted average rates paid on borrowed funds decreased to approximately for from in this decrease represents the renewal of certain borrowings which came due in at lower rates than they had been obtained for previously 
the decrease in the cost of borrowed money is consistent with the cumulative effect of the federal reserve s actions taken in the second half of to reduce the inter bank borrowing rate by basis points partially offset by the actions taken by the federal reserve in to increase that same rate by basis points 
see asset liability management for further discussion of the competitive market for deposits and overall strategies for uses of borrowed funds 
non interest income total non interest income increased  or in in comparison to customer service fees  which were  for as compared to  for  for an increase of  or  rose primarily due to growth in deposit accounts  primarily now and checking accounts 
loan servicing fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans were  and  respectively  for as compared to  and  respectively  in  a combined increase of  or 
the increase in gains on sales was generally reflective of the company s acquisition of old colony mortgage and also the favorable consumer rates for residential loans for the first nine months of which resulted in increased saleable loan production compared to the same period in as the company has been selling loans generally on a servicing released basis since  the portfolio of loans serviced for others has declined which has caused the continued drop in loan servicing income 
gains on sales of securities were  for as compared to  for for a decrease of  or 
while the equity markets remained relatively strong for  management elected to sell fewer holdings 
non interest expenses non interest expenses for increased  or compared to salaries and employee benefits increased or  primarily due to the acquisition of old colony mortgage approximately  and increases in supermarket branch staff approximately 
the increases in supermarket staffing were the result of more supermarket branches being open during than compared to the same period in the branches primarily affecting this difference  with their opening dates in parenthesis  were randolph april  hanson september and brockton may 
these increases correspond with the company s strategic focus of attracting core deposits and new customer relationships 
the increase in salaries and benefits expense  excluding old colony mortgage and the supermarket branches  was approximately  or 
occupancy expenses increased  or primarily due to the acquisition of old colony mortgage approximately  the effect of increasing the number of supermarket branches approximately  and increases in other capital and technology expenditures 
other non interest expenses  including trust preferred expenses  also increased  or for in comparison to of this amount  approximately  of the aforementioned increases relates to expenses related to guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities which were issued in june  and approximately  related to the old colony mortgage operation and an additional  related to increases in the number of supermarket branches 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses was reduced to  for from  in  a decline of  or 
the primary reason for the reduction in provisions in vs 
was due to the recovery of approximately  on a previously charged off commercial real estate loan as well as the continued strength of other asset quality factors that management uses to evaluate the adequacy of loan loss reserve levels 
provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for was compared to for the lower effective tax rate in comparison to statutory rates for both periods is reflective of income earned by certain non bank subsidiaries which are taxed  for state tax purposes  at lower rates 
additionally  the overall effective tax rate is influenced by the proportion of income generated by non bank subsidiaries 
in  a greater portion of income was generated through non bank subsidiaries as compared to asset liability management the objective of asset liability management is to ensure that liquidity  capital and market risk are prudently managed 
asset liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the company s board of directors board 
the board delegates responsibility for asset liability management to the corporate asset liability management committee alco 
alco sets strategic directives that guide the day to day asset liability management activities of the company 
alco also reviews and approves all major funding  capital and market risk management programs 
alco is comprised of members of management and executive management of the company and the bank 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
the primary objective of interest rate risk management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board and by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying potential exposures and developing tactical plans to address such potential exposures 
the company quantifies its interest rate risk exposures using sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as a more simple gap analysis 
the company manages its interest rate exposures by generally using on balance sheet strategies  which is most easily accomplished through the management of the durations and rate sensitivities of the company s investments  including mortgage backed securities portfolios  and by extending or shortening maturities of borrowed funds 
additionally  pricing strategies  asset sales and  in some cases  hedge strategies are also considered in the evaluation and management of interest rate risk exposures 
the company uses simulation analysis to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a to year time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet positions under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to ramp up or down basis points over a month period  estimated net interest income for the next months should decline by less than 
the following table reflects the company s estimated exposure  as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next months  which does not materially differ from the impact on net income  on the above basis rate change estimated exposure as a basis points of net interest income interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and repricing characteristics of the on balance sheet and off balance sheet positions 
the interest rate gap analysis is prepared by scheduling all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions according to scheduled repricing or maturity 
interest rate gap analysis can be viewed as a short hand complement to simulation and valuation analysis 
the company s policy is to match  as well as possible  the interest rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities 
generally  residential mortgage loans currently originated by the company are sold in the secondary market 
residential mortgage loans that the company currently originates  from time to time  or purchases for the company s own portfolio are primarily year  year  year and year adjustable rate mortgages and shorter term generally year or seasoned year fixed rate mortgages 
the company also emphasizes loans with terms to maturity or repricing of years or less  such as certain commercial mortgages  business loans  residential construction loans and home equity loans 
management desires to expand its interest earning asset base in future periods primarily through growth in the company s loan portfolio 
loans comprised approximately of the average interest earning assets in in the future  the company intends to continue to be competitive in the residential mortgage market but plans to place greater emphasis on home equity and commercial loans 
the company also historically has been and expects to become more active in pursuing wholesale opportunities to purchase loans 
during  and  the company acquired approximately   and  respectively  of residential first mortgages which are serviced by others 
the company has also used mortgage backed investments typically with weighted average lives of to years as a vehicle for fixed and adjustable rate investments and as an overall asset liability tool 
these securities have been highly liquid given current levels of prepayments in the underlying mortgage pools and  as a result  have provided the company with greater reinvestment flexibility 
one of the factors influencing earning asset levels and their yields since has been the intensity of prepayment activity on mortgage related assets which have been prompted by the very attractive refinancing opportunities that the market has presented consumers for the better part of the past two years 
management estimates that over of its earning assets at december  have paid off by december  and were replaced with similar assets at generally lower yields 
this has contributed to the continued downward trend in asset yields in and this effect was offset in part by the acquisition origination of loans and investments at higher yields in  due to the rising interest rate environment which existed 
management does anticipate  however  given the early market trends and interest rate forecasts by economists  that prepayment activity and declining asset yield trends may develop in the level of the company s liquid assets and the mix of its investments may vary  depending upon management s judgment as to market trends  the quality of specific investment opportunities and the relative attractiveness of their maturities and yields 
management has been aggressively promoting the company s core deposit products since the first quarter of  particularly checking and now accounts 
the success of this program has favorably impacted the overall deposit growth to date  despite interest rate and general market pressures  and has helped the company to increase its customer base 
however  given the strong performance of mutual funds and the equity markets in general  the company and many of its peers have begun to see lower levels of growth in time deposits as compared to prior years as customers reflect their desire to increase their returns on investment 
this pressure has been exacerbated currently by the historically low long term economic interest rates 
management believes that the markets for future time deposit growth  particularly with terms in excess of years  will remain highly competitive 
management will continue to evaluate future funding strategies and alternatives accordingly as well as to continue to focus its efforts on attracting core  retail deposit relationships 
the company is also a voluntary member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of boston 
this borrowing capacity assists the company in managing its asset liability growth because  at times  the company considers it more advantageous to borrow money from the fhlb of boston than to raise money through non core deposits ie  certificates of deposit 
borrowed funds totaled  at december  compared to  at december  these borrowings are primarily comprised of fhlb of boston advances and have primarily funded residential loan originations and purchases as well as mortgage backed investments and investment securities 
additionally  as of december   approximately million of the company s borrowings were used to acquire cash as part of the company s year contingency plans 
nearly all of this amount was paid off in early january as the majority of the cash was returned to the federal reserve 
also  the company obtained funding in june through the issuance of trust preferred securities which carry a higher interest rate than similar fhlb borrowings but at the same time are included as capital  without diluting earnings per share and are tax deductible 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
the following table sets forth maturity and repricing information relating to interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the balance of such accounts has been allocated among the various periods based upon the terms and repricing intervals of the particular assets and liabilities 
for example  fixed rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  regardless of available for sale classification  are shown in the table in the time periods corresponding to projected principal amortization computed based on their respective weighted average maturities and weighted average rates using prepayment data available from the secondary mortgage market 
adjustable rate loans and securities are allocated to the period in which the rates would be next adjusted 
the following table does not reflect partial or full prepayment of certain types of loans and investment securities prior to scheduled contractual maturity 
additionally  all securities or borrowings which are callable at the option of the issuer or lender are reflected in the following table based upon the likelihood of call options being exercised by the issuer on certain investments or borrowings in a most likely interest rate environment 
since regular passbook savings and now accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  such accounts have been included in the other savings accounts category and are assumed to mature within months 
this table does not include non interest bearing deposits 
while this table presents a cumulative negative gap position in the month to year horizon  the company considers its earning assets to be more sensitive to interest rate movements than its liabilities 
in general  assets are tied to increases that are immediately impacted by interest rate movements while deposit rates are generally driven by market area and demand which tend to be less sensitive to general interest rate changes 
in addition  other savings accounts and money market accounts are substantially stable core deposits  although subject to rate changes 
a substantial core balance in these type of accounts is anticipated to be maintained over time

liquidity and capital resources payments and prepayments on the company s loan and mortgage backed investment portfolios  sales of fixed rate residential loans  increases in deposits  borrowed funds and maturities of various investments comprise the company s primary sources of liquidity 
the company is also a voluntary member of the fhlb of boston and  as such  is entitled to borrow an amount up to the value of its qualified collateral that has not been pledged to outside sources 
qualified collateral generally consists of residential first mortgage loans  securities issued  insured or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies  and funds on deposit at the fhlb of boston 
short term advances may be used for any sound business purpose  while long term advances may be used only for the purpose of providing funds to finance housing 
at december   the company had approximately  in unused borrowing capacity that is contingent upon the purchase of additional fhlb of boston stock 
use of this borrowing capacity is also impacted by capital adequacy considerations 
the company s short term borrowing position consists primarily of fhlb of boston advances with original maturities of approximately to months 
the company utilizes borrowed funds as a primary vehicle to manage interest rate risk  due to the ability to easily extend or shorten maturities as needed 
this enables the company to adjust its cash needs to the increased prepayment activity in its loan and mortgage backed investment portfolios  as well as to quickly extend maturities when the need to further balance the company s gap position arises 
the company regularly monitors its asset quality to determine the level of its loan loss reserves through periodic credit reviews by members of the company s management credit committee 
the management credit committee  which reports to the executive committee of the company s board of directors  also works on the collection of non accrual loans and disposition of real estate acquired by foreclosure 
the allowance for possible loan losses is determined by the management credit committee after consideration of several key factors including  without limitation potential risk in the current portfolio  levels and types of non performing assets and delinquency  levels of potential problem loans  which generally have varying degrees of loan collateral and repayment issues  on the watched asset reports 
workout approach and financial condition of borrowers are also key considerations to the evaluation of non performing loans 
non performing assets were  at december   compared to  at december   a decrease of  or 
the company s percentage of delinquent loans to total loans was 
at december   as compared to 
at december  management believes that while delinquency rates and non performing assets remain at relatively low levels  these factors are at historic lows  and at some point in the future some degree of economic slowdown would likely result in future increases in problem assets and ultimately loan loss provisions 
management continues to monitor the overall economic environment and its potential effects on future credit quality on an ongoing basis 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments to originate  purchase and sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market amounting to  and  respectively 
the company also has outstanding commitments to grant advances under existing home equity lines of credit amounting to  unadvanced commitments under outstanding commercial and construction loans totaled  as of december  the company believes it has adequate sources of liquidity to fund these commitments 
the company s total stockholders equity was  or of total assets at december   compared with  or of total assets at december  the increase in total stockholders equity of approximately  or primarily resulted from decreases in the unrealized loss on the market value of available for sale securities  net of taxes and earnings of the company 
stock repurchases and dividends paid partially offset the effect of these increases 
the company issued  of trust preferred securities in june under current regulatory guidelines  trust preferred securities are allowed to represent up to approximately of the company s tier capital with any excess amounts available as tier capital 
as of december   approximately  of these securities was included in tier capital 
bank regulatory authorities have established a capital measurement tool called tier leverage capital 
a ratio of tier capital to assets now constitutes the minimum capital standard for most banking organizations and a tier leverage capital ratio is required for a well capitalized classification 
at december   the company s tier leverage capital ratio was approximately 
in addition  regulatory authorities have also implemented risk based capital guidelines requiring a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of for well capitalized and a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of for well capitalized 
at december   the company s tier and total risk based capital ratios were approximately and  respectively 
the company is categorized as well capitalized under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia the bank is also categorized as well capitalized as of december  impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements of the company and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which generally require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature
