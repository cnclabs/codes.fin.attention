comed comed is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  credit and interest rates 
commodity price risk as part of exelon s corporate restructuring  comed has entered into a power purchase agreement with generation to meet its retail customer obligations at fixed prices 
comed s principal exposure to commodity price risk is in relation to revenues collected from customers who elect the power purchase option at market based prices  and ctc revenues which are calculated to provide the customer with a credit for the market price for electricity 
comed has performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the net impact of a decrease in the average around the clock market price of electricity 
because the decrease in revenues from customers electing the power purchase option is significantly offset by increased ctc revenues  comed does not believe that its exposure to such a market price decrease would be material 
credit risk comed is obligated to provide service to all customers within its franchised territories and  as a result  has a broad customer base 
for the year ended december   comed s ten largest customers represented approximately of its retail electric revenues 
comed manages credit risk using credit and collection policies which are regulated by the icc 
interest rate risk comed uses a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to reduce interest rate exposure 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with variable rate debt would result in a decrease in pre tax earnings for of less than million
