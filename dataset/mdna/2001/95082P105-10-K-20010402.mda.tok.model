item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general wesco s sales can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and generally represent to of total sales 
approximately to of wesco s total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
gross profit margins on stock and special order sales are approximately higher than those on direct ship sales 
although direct ship gross margins are lower  operating profit margins are often comparable  since the product handling and fulfillment costs associated with direct shipments are much lower 
wesco has historically financed its acquisitions  new branch openings  working capital needs and capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow and borrowings under its credit facilities 
during the initial phase of an acquisition or new branch opening  wesco typically incurs expenses related to installing or converting information systems  training employees and other initial operating activities 
with some acquisitions  wesco may incur expenses in connection with the closure of any of its own redundant branches 
historically  the costs associated with opening new branches  and closing branches in connection with certain acquisitions  have not been material 
wesco has accounted for its acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
wesco is a leading consolidator in its industry  having acquired companies since august  representing annual sales of approximately billion 
management distinguishes sales attributable to core operations separate from sales of acquired businesses 
the distinction between sales from core operations and from acquired businesses is based on the company s internal records and on management estimates where the integration of acquired businesses results in the closing or consolidation of branches 
however  core operations typically refer to all internally started branches and all acquired branches that have been in operation for the entire current and prior year to date periods 
acquired businesses generally refer to branch operations purchased by wesco where the branches have not been under wesco ownership for the entire current and prior year to date periods 
developments developments affecting the results of operations and financial position of wesco include the following restructuring and special charges 
in the fourth quarter of  wesco commenced certain programs to reduce costs  improve productivity and exit certain operations 
total costs under these programs were million  and were comprised of million related to the closure of fourteen branch operations in the united states  canada and the balkans  and million related to the write down of an investment in an affiliate 
the million charge related to the closure of fourteen branch operations is principally comprised of an inventory write down of approximately million and lease termination costs of approximately million  the majority of which will be paid in the million investment write down is a result of management s decision to no longer pursue its business strategy with an affiliate 
in addition  wesco recorded other charges of million in the fourth quarter of the other charges were comprised of million due to the deteriorating credit environment and customer bankruptcy filings and million relating to inventory write downs as a result of actions taken to align inventories with current market conditions

as of february   the company had purchased approximately million shares of its common stock for approximately million pursuant to this program

an analysis of cash flows for and follows operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million a year ago 
cash provided by operations in and included proceeds of million and million  respectively  from the sale of accounts receivable in connection with the accounts receivable securitization program 
excluding these proceeds  operating activities provided million in and million in on this basis  the year to year increase in operating cash flow of million was primarily due to increased income adjusted for non cash charges  partially offset by an increase in working capital 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in cash used for investing activities was higher in primarily due to amounts invested in business acquisitions 
capital expenditures in were million compared to million in and were for computer equipment and software  branch and distribution center facility improvements  forklifts and delivery vehicles 
capital expenditures for are not expected to differ significantly from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in which was primarily due to net borrowings of million  partially offset by the company s treasury stock purchase program 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million and was primarily due to the offering  partially offset by a reduction in long term debt and treasury stock purchases 
for the year ended december   wesco purchased approximately million shares of its common stock for approximately million 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the credit agreement and the receivables facility  will be sufficient to meet wesco s working capital  capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be the case 
financing of acquisitions can be funded under the existing credit agreement and may  depending on the number and size of the acquisitions  require the issuance of additional debt and equity securities 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  did not have a material effect on the sales or operating results of the company during the periods presented 
however  inflation in the future could affect the company s operating costs 
price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
seasonality the company s operating results are affected by certain seasonal factors 
sales are typically at their lowest during the first quarter due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months 
sales increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continuing through november 
sales drop again slightly in december as the weather cools and also as a result of a reduced level of activity during the holiday season 
as a result  the company reports sales and earnings in the first quarter that are generally lower than that of the remaining quarters 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  as amended by sfas no 
 was adopted by wesco on january  this statement requires the recognition of the fair value of any derivative financial instrument on the balance sheet 
changes in fair value of the derivative and  in certain instances  changes in the fair value of an underlying hedged asset or liability  are recognized through either income or as a component of other comprehensive income 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of wesco 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue  and provides guidelines for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
the application of this guidance did not have a material impact on wesco s consolidated financial statements in in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 a modification of sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers after march  and is effective for disclosures about securitizations and collateral and for recognition and reclassification of collateral for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure provisions of this statement have been adopted 
the adoption of this statement for future transfers is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of wesco 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks over of wesco s sales are denominated in united states dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to wesco s operating results 
wesco does have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe and asia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  wesco may derive a more significant portion of its sales from international operations and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  wesco s future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that wesco engages in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make wesco s products less competitive in international markets 
wesco has and will continue to monitor its exposure to currency fluctuations 
interest rate risks wesco s indebtedness as of december  is comprised of million of variable rate borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility and million of fixed rate borrowings 
interest cost under the revolving credit facility is based on various indices plus a borrowing margin 
wesco uses interest rate cap agreements to hedge a portion of its debt cost in an attempt to strike a favorable balance between fixed and variable rate 
the interest rate cap agreements effectively cap wesco s base libor rate at for million of borrowings through may and at for million of borrowings through august the interest rate cap agreements did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the interest rate on wesco s revolving credit agreement was at december  a hypothetical change in this interest rate based on variable rate borrowing levels at december  and including the impact of the interest rate caps would result in a million increase or decrease in interest rate expense
