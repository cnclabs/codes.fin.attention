the bank loan agreement provides the borrowers with a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility allows the borrowers to borrow up to million based upon a borrowing base formula as defined in the agreement principally of eligible accounts receivable 
the bank loan agreement s revolving credit loans of million are scheduled to mature on september  the term loan amortizes in equal monthly installments of  the revolving loans bear interest at ibj whitehall s alternate base rate plus one half of one percent a total of per annum at december   and the term loan bears interest at such alternate based rate plus three quarters of one percent a total of per annum at december

the facility is secured with the assets of the spar group 
the bank loan agreement contains an option for the bank to purchase  shares of common stock of the company for per share in the event that the company s average closing share price over ten consecutive trading day period exceeds per share 
this option expires september  the bank loan agreement contains certain financial covenants that must be met by the borrowers on a consolidated basis  among which are a minimum net worth  a fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum ratio of debt to ebitda  and a minimum ebitda  as such terms are defined in the bank loan agreement

cash and cash equivalents and the timely collection of its receivables provide the spar group s current liquidity 
however  the potential of delays in collection of receivables due from any of the spar group s major clients  or a significant reduction in business from such clients  or the inability to acquire new clients  would have a material adverse effect on the spar group s cash resources and its ongoing ability to fund operations 
as of december   the spar group is obligated  under certain circumstances  to pay severance compensation to its employees and other costs in connection with the merger restructure charges of approximately million 
in addition  the company incurred substantial cost in connection with the transaction  including legal  accounting and investment banking fees estimated to be an aggregate unpaid obligation as of december  of approximately million 
the spar group has also accrued approximately million for expenses incurred by pia prior to the merger  which have not been paid as of december  management believes the current bank credit facilities are sufficient to fund operations and working capital  including the current maturities of debt obligations  but may not be sufficient to reduce obligations of the merger with pia 
the company is currently working to secure additional long term capital to meet the non operational credit needs 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these negotiations 
in and prior  certain former principal stockholders of the spar companies each made loans to certain spar companies in the aggregate amount of million to facilitate the acquisition of the pia companies and the assets of old mci 
these stockholders were also owed million in unpaid distributions relating to the former status of certain of the operating spar companies as subchapter s corporations see note to the financial statements 
those amounts were converted into promissory notes issued to these certain stockholders severally by smf  sinc and spgi prior to the merger  which aggregated million 
as of december   a total of million remained outstanding under these notes  of which approximately million have an interest rate of and are due on demand 
the long term portion totaling million have a fluctuating interest rate equal to the sum of the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal from time to time plus 
the current bank agreements contain certain restrictions on the repayment of stockholder debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the spar group is exposed to market risk related to the variable interest rate on the line of credit and term note and the variable yield on its cash and cash equivalents 
the spar group s accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures relating to financial instruments require that the spar group s consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term debt 
the spar group considers carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments because of the relatively short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization 
the carrying amounts of long term debt approximate fair value because the obligation bears interest at a floating rate 
the spar group monitors the risks associated with interest rates and financial instrument positions 
the spar group s investment policy objectives require the preservation and safety of the principal  and the maximization of the return on investment based upon the safety and liquidity objectives 
currently  the spar group s revenue derived from international operations is not material and  therefore  the risk related to foreign currency exchange rates is not material 
investment portfolio the spar group has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in its cash and cash equivalents and investments 
the spar group invests its cash and cash equivalents in investments in high quality and highly liquid investments consisting of taxable money market instruments
