item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview swift s fleet has been predominantly comprised of company owned and leased tractors 
the company s decisions whether to buy or lease new and replacement revenue equipment are based upon the overall economic impact of the alternative financing methods  including market prices available and income tax considerations 
depending on whether revenue equipment is purchased or leased  several categories of the company s operating expenses have varied  and will continue to vary  as a percentage of the company s revenues 
because of the impact that equipment financing methods can have on the operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  the company believes that the most meaningful comparative measure of its operating efficiency is its pre tax margin earnings before income taxes as a percentage of operating revenue  which takes into consideration both the company s total operating expenses and net interest expense as a percentage of operating revenue 
accordingly  in the discussion and analysis below  the company has focused on the factors contributing to operating revenue increases and to the increase or decrease in its pre tax margin during the periods presented 
in the forward looking statements that may be included herein  important factors such as the financial position of the company  its customers needs  the cost of new equipment and new construction  the availability of buyers in the marketplace  fuel costs and other factors may cause actual results to vary 
although the trend of shippers in the truckload segment of the motor carrier industry over the past several years has been towards consolidation  the truckload industry remains highly fragmented 
management believes the industry trend towards financially stable core carriers will continue and result in continued industry consolidation 
in response to this trend  the company continues to expand its total fleet with  tractors as of december  compared to  tractors as of december  see business general 
during this same period  the company s owner operator fleet has expanded to  as of december  from as of december  this fleet growth was accomplished through a combination of internal growth and through strategic acquisitions 
see business general 
as discussed under business pending acquisition  swift has entered into an agreement to acquire ms carriers 
this acquisition  if consummated  would have a significant impact on swift s financial conditions and results of operations 
in particular  swift s equity capitalization  revenues and other indicia of financial performance will change significantly due to the issuance of swift common stock  the inclusion of ms carriers operating results and the anticipated integration and other costs associated with the merger  among other factors 
accordingly  the results discussed below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods in the event that the ms carriers transaction is consummated 
for additional information regarding the ms carriers acquisition  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain statement of earnings data as a percentage of operating revenue december  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits operating supplies and expenses fuel purchased transportation rental expense insurance and claims depreciation and amortization communications and utilities operating taxes and licenses total operating expenses operating income net interest expense 
other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the previous year 
the increase in operating revenue is due primarily to the expansion of the company s total fleet to  tractors at december  from  at december   an increase of  tractors  rate increases of approximately and a fuel surcharge revenue increase of approximately million 
the company s operating ratio was and in and  respectively 
the company s operating ratio for increased as a result of changes in certain components of operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue as discussed below 
the company s empty mile factor was and and the average loaded linehaul revenue per mile was and excluding fuel surcharge for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries  wages and employee benefits represented of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the accrual for the company s k profit sharing contribution and an increase in the portion of revenues generated by owner operators offset by normal wage increases with associated benefits and taxes 
from time to time the industry has experienced shortages of qualified drivers 
if such a shortage were to occur over a prolonged period and increases in driver pay rates were to occur in order to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding rate increases were not obtained 
fuel expenses represented and of operating revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in fuel as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to increased fuel prices and offset by the impact of an increase in the miles generated by the owner operator fleet 
actual fuel cost per gallon increased by approximately cents per gallon in versus increases in fuel costs  to the extent not offset by rate increases or fuel surcharges  would have an adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
management believes that the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel efficient fleet and to implement fuel surcharges when such an option is necessary and available 
the company did not use derivative type hedging products  but periodically evaluates their possible use 
purchased transportation represented and of operating revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due to the growth of the company s owner operator fleet from  at december  to  at december  rental expense as a percentage of operating revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  leased tractors represented approximately and  respectively of the fleet exclusive of owner operators 
when it is economically feasible to do so  the company will purchase then sell tractors it leases by exercising the purchase option contained in the lease 
gains on these activities are recorded as a reduction of rent expense 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  the company recorded gains of approximately million and million from the sale of leased tractors 
exclusive of gains  which reduced rental expense  the percentage of rental expense to operating revenue in and was and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense was and of operating revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december  the company recorded gains on the sale of revenue equipment of approximately million compared with approximately million in exclusive of gains  which reduced depreciation and amortization expense  the percentage of depreciation and amortization to operating revenue in and was 
insurance and claims expense represented and of operating revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s insurance program for liability  physical damage and cargo damage involves self insurance with varying risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk retention levels are covered by insurance in amounts which management considers adequate 
the company accrues the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based on historical claims development trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase was due to increased borrowings under the company s line of credit and increased proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from million for the previous year 
the increase in operating revenue is due primarily to the expansion of the company s total fleet to  tractors at december  from  at december   an increase of  tractors 
the company s operating ratio was and in and  respectively 
the company s operating ratio for increased as a result of changes in certain components of operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue as discussed below 
the company s empty mile factor was and and the average loaded linehaul revenue per mile was and excluding fuel surcharge for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries  wages and employee benefits represented of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the decrease is due primarily to the reversal of a million accrual related to an eeoc action as a result of the company agreeing to pay an amount significantly below the amount of the original settlement offer 
this reversal of accrual was offset by an increase in the accrual for the company s k profit sharing contribution and normal wage increases with associated benefits and taxes 
in february  the company announced an increase in certain driver wage rates effective april  the company expects this increase to be substantially offset by an increase in operating revenue as a result of increases in rates charged to customers 
fuel expenses represented and of operating revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in fuel as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to increased fuel prices and offset by the impact of an increase in the revenue generated by the owner operator fleet 
actual fuel cost per gallon increased by approximately cents per gallon in versus fuel costs for the first sixty days of increased forty five cents per gallon compared to the same period in  an increase of 
purchased transportation represented and of operating revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due to the growth of the company s owner operator fleet from  at december  to  at december  and an increase in logistics and intermodal operations 
rental expense as a percentage of operating revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  leased tractors represented approximately and  respectively of the fleet exclusive of owner operators 
in addition to the reduction in the percentage of tractors which were leased  rental expense was positively impacted by a reduction in the number of leased trailers in versus when it is economically feasible to do so  the company will purchase then sell tractors it leases by exercising the purchase option contained in the lease 
gains on these activities are recorded as a reduction of rent expense 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  the company recorded gains of approximately million and million from the sale of leased tractors 
depreciation and amortization expense was and of operating revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december  the company recorded gains on the sale of revenue equipment of approximately million compared with approximately million in exclusive of gains  which reduced depreciation and amortization expense  the percentage of depreciation and amortization to operating revenue in and was and  respectively 
insurance and claims expense represented and of operating revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s insurance program for liability  physical damage and cargo damage involves self insurance with varying risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk retention levels are covered by insurance in amounts which management considers adequate 
the company accrues the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based on historical claims development trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase was due to increased borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
this rate was positively impacted in by the finalization of certain tax strategies and an enterprise zone credit 
liquidity and capital resources the continued growth in the company s business requires significant investment in new revenue equipment  upgraded and expanded facilities  and enhanced computer hardware and software 
the funding for this expansion has been from cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of revenue equipment  long term debt  borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit  proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization  the use of operating leases to finance the acquisition of revenue equipment and from periodic public offerings of common stock 
the company s current liabilities increased significantly as a result of the receipt of million of proceeds under the accounts receivable securitization 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the receipts under the securitization are required to be shown as a current liability because the committed term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in net earnings  deferred taxes and accounts payable  accrued liabilities and claims accruals offset by a increase in depreciation and amortization and a smaller increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase is due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures and the investment in transplace 
com offset by increased proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
as of december   the company had commitments outstanding to acquire replacement and additional revenue equipment for approximately million 
the company has the option to cancel such commitments upon days notice 
the company believes it has the ability to obtain debt and lease financing and generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to support these acquisitions of revenue equipment 
during the year ended december   the company incurred approximately million of non revenue equipment capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for facilities and equipment 
the company anticipates that it will expend approximately million in for various facilities upgrades and acquisition and development of terminal facilities 
factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures 
the funding for capital expenditures has been and will be from a combination of cash provided by operating activities  amounts available under the company s line of credit  accounts receivable securitization  and debt and lease financing 
the availability of capital for revenue equipment and other capital expenditures will be affected by prevailing market conditions and the company s financial condition and results of operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to increased proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization offset by treasury stock purchases 
management believes that it will be able to finance its needs for working capital  facilities improvements and expansion  as well as anticipated fleet growth  with cash flows from operations  borrowings available under the line of credit  accounts receivable securitization and with long term debt and operating lease financing believed to be available to finance revenue equipment purchases 
over the long term  the company will continue to have significant capital requirements  which may require the company to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of debt financing or equity capital will depend upon the company s financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions  the market price of the company s common stock and other factors over which the company has little or no control 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation would cause interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs to increase and would adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season 
the company s operating expenses also tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to successfully provide truckload carrier services to meet dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  the factors discussed below 
general economic and business factors 
the company s business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  tolls  license and registration fees and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and owner operators 
the company s results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as retail  manufacturing and paper products in which the company has a concentration of customers 
in addition  the company s results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and the company s operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
competition 
the trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with railroads 
competition has created downward pressure on the truckload industry s pricing structure 
there are some trucking companies with which the company competes that have greater financial resources than the company  own more revenue equipment and carry a larger volume of freight than the company 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
the company depends on cash from operations  operating leases and debt financing for funds to expand the size of its fleet and maintain modern revenue equipment 
if the company were unable in the future to enter into acceptable financing arrangements  it would have to limit its growth and might be required to operate its revenue equipment for longer periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
acquisitions 
the growth of the company has been dependent in part upon the acquisition of trucking companies throughout the united states 
to date  the company has been successful in identifying trucking companies to acquire and in integrating such companies operations into the company s operations 
the company may face competition from transportation companies or other third parties for acquisition opportunities that become available 
there can be no assurance that the company will identify acquisition candidates that will result in successful combinations in the future 
any future acquisitions by the company may result in the incurrence of additional debt and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  which could adversely affect the company s profitability  or could involve the potentially dilutive issuance of additional equity securities 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilation of the acquired company s operations particularly in the period immediately following the consummation of such transactions  the diversion of the attention of the company s management from other business  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
merger with ms carriers 
the company may be unable to successfully integrate its operations with the operations of ms carriers and realize the full cost savings it anticipates to result from the acquisition of ms carriers 
such inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
specifically  the company may have difficulty maintaining customer service and equipment utilization standards while attempting to integrate its operations with the operations of ms carriers  coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds  maintaining momentum in the activities of one or more of the combined companies business segments  and retaining key personnel  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the acquisition of ms carriers could divert management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
following the acquisition of ms carriers  customers may decrease freight volumes with swift because of the concentration of their businesses with the combined companies 
if this occurs  it could have a material adverse effect on the business and operations of the company 
in addition  the company will also incur significant expenses and restructuring charges in connection with the acquisition  some of which may be unanticipated 
if such costs and charges are not offset by the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the issuance of additional swift shares in connection with the acquisition of ms carriers may have a dilutive impact on the earnings per share of the company 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of mr 
jerry moyes  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  mr 
william f 
riley  iii  senior executive vice president and chief financial officer  mr 
rodney k 
sartor  executive vice president  mr

farley  executive vice president  and mr 
kevin h 
jensen  executive vice president 
mr 
moyes has other significant business interests to which he devotes his time and efforts  including serving as chairman of simon transportation services  inc  a truckload carrier providing nationwide  predominately temperature controlled transportation services for major shippers  and central freight lines  inc  a regional less than truckload carrier 
mr 
moyes is also the largest stockholder of simon transportation and central freight lines 
although the company believes it has an experienced and talented management group  the loss of the services of mr 
moyes  mr 
riley  mr 
sartor  mr 
farley or mr 
jensen could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and future profitability 
the company does not have employment agreements with nor does it maintain key man life insurance on messrs 
riley  sartor  farley or jensen 
the company does not have an employment agreement with but does maintain key man life insurance on mr 
moyes 
regulation 
the company is regulated by the united states department of transportation 
this regulatory authority exercises broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and certain mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
swift may also become subject to new or more comprehensive or restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  ergonomics and limitations on hours of service 
the increased cost of complying with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on swift s business and operating results 
in addition  the company s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal and handling of hazardous materials  discharge of stormwater and underground fuel storage tanks 
if the company should be involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if the company were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
used equipment market 
swift relies on the sale of used equipment to offset the cost of purchasing new equipment 
in the past months  used tractor values have deteriorated significantly 
should this trend continue  it could have a material adverse effect on swift s business and operating results 
claims exposure  insurance 
the company currently self insures for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury and property damage  and maintains insurance with licensed insurance companies above its limits on self insurance 
to the extent the company were to experience an increase in the number of claims for which it is self insured  the company s operating results would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  significant increases in insurance costs  to the extent not offset by freight rate increases  would reduce the company s profitability 
dependence on key customers 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated from key customers 
during  the company s top  and customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
the company does not have long term contractual relationships with many of its key customers  and there can be no assurance that the company s relationships with its key customers will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of the company s services by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate exposure arising from the company s line of credit and accounts receivable securitization which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short term interest rates 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and variable rate debt and lease financing 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt approximated carrying value 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the company s annual interest expense by million
