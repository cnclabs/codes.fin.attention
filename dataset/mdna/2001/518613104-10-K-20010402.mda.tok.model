item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from the changes in the price of financial instruments 
the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and investment values 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements related to significant foreign acquisitions 
exposure to market risks related to operating activities is managed through its regular operating and financing activities 
foreign currency risk the company derives approximately of its revenues from continuing operations from customers outside of the united states 
this business is transacted through a network of international subsidiaries  generally in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
expenses are also incurred in the foreign currencies to match revenues earned and minimize the company s exchange rate exposure to operating margins 
a hypothetical weakening of of the us dollar relative to all other currencies should not materially adversely affect expected earnings or cash flows 
the company generally views its investment in the majority of its foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the functional currencies of these foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro based currencies 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in other comprehensive income 
a depreciation in functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a decrease in consolidated stockholders equity at december  of approximately million 
the company has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to manage the currency fluctuations in significant foreign transactions  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts for purposes of business acquisitions are reflected in the income statement 
interest rate risk the company holds its cash and cash equivalents in high quality short term fixed income securities consequently  the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due to the short term nature of the company s portfolio 
the company s long term revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this instrument is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company s convertible debentures bear interest at  which presently approximates the market rate and therefore the fair value approximates the recorded value of this liability 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would impact net interest income and interest expense by reducing pretax income for the year ended december  by million 
investment risk the company s investment portfolio contains high quality debt securities that mature within one year 
a hypothetical adverse change in the fair value of the debt securities should not materially adversely effect earnings or cash flows because of the company s ability to hold the debt securities until maturity 
in addition to the debt securities  the company has an investment portfolio that consists of direct investment positions in education technology companies through sylvan ventures as well as short term investments in available for sale debt and equity securities 
the company s investment portfolio is exposed to risks arising from changes in these investment values 
the company s investment portfolio includes a number of holdings of non publicly traded companies in the educational services industry 
the company values these investments at either cost less impairment if any or under the equity method of accounting 
equity method investors are specifically excluded from the scope of this disclosure 
non public investments where the company owns less than a stake are subject to fluctuations in market value  but their current illiquidity reduces the exposure to pure market risk while resulting in risk that the company may not be able to liquidate these investments in a timely manner 
the company is exposed to equity price risks on equity securities included in the portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally small capitalization stocks in the internet segment of the educational services industry 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would not materially impact the fair value of the company s marketable securities and comprehensive income 
all the potential impacts noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on the company s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
