all significant intercompany accounts and transactions  including management fees  have been eliminated 
with regard to the patient service and provider segment which was completely exited in  because of corporate practice of medicine laws in certain states in which the company operated  the company did not own the professional corporations which operated the professional and clinical aspects of the behavioral health provider operations in those states  but instead had the contractual right to designate  in its sole discretion and at any time  the licensed professional who was the owner of the capital stock of the professional corporation at a nominal cost nominee arrangements

the company believes the future revenues under these contracts will exceed the costs of services it will be required to provide under the terms of the contracts

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  which established accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identified intangible assets and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain intangible assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas  the company reviews the realizability of long lived assets  certain intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate recorded costs may not be recoverable 
the company also reviews the overall recoverability of goodwill based primarily on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if over the remaining useful life of such assets  the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and their estimated fair value 
in estimating future cash flows  the company uses a combination of recent operating results  financial forecasts and budgets  and management estimates and assumptions of factors such as growth and potential future changes when determining whether an asset is impaired  and in measuring assets that are impaired  the company groups assets by geographic region 
the geographic region is the level at which the company contracts with managed care payors  deploys administrative and clinical resources and consolidates back office operations

based on discussions with psychpartners personnel  as well as developments in the bankruptcy court  the company understands that psychpartners intends to discontinue all future operations and liquidate all existing assets to satisfy outstanding obligations 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  psychpartners assumed responsibility for all facility leases associated with the practices sold 
while the company obtained assignment letters for many of those leases  due to the nature of both real estate and bankruptcy laws  it is possible that the company will be responsible for a portion of those remaining lease obligations 
the company has engaged special counsel and is evaluating its exposure with regard to this matter on an ongoing basis 
the company estimates that there were approximately open leases with approximately  in remaining payments under the lease terms  not including certain fees and expenses  for which the company may be responsible 
the company intends to aggressively pursue resolution of this matter in terms most favorable to the company

during the company paid relating to both lease obligations and legal costs in connection with the settlement of ten leases 
in connection with the settlement of these leases  during  the company recognized in income to the extent that the amounts previously reserved exceeded the required settlement payments 
in addition to the lease exposure described above  psychpartners defaulted on certain deferred contingent purchase price obligations which were part of the original acquisition agreements for practices previously purchased by integra 
these liabilities were assumed by psychpartners under the terms of the purchase agreement 
the company believes that it has no remaining responsibility for these obligations  however  the individuals associated with these practices may choose to assert a claim against the company 
at december   the company had not established a reserve for these amounts which it estimates may aggregate to  the company intends to vigorously contest any claims related to this matter

due to the nature of these matters the company cannot predict when these matters will be resolved 
the company does not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s overall financial condition  liquidity or operations

working capital deficit   debt to equity inflation a significant portion of the company s operating expenses have been subject to inflationary increases  including clinical and administrative salaries and rent expense 
based upon management s assessment  the company has historically been unable to substantially offset inflationary increases through price increases but believes the company has somewhat mitigated the effect by expanding services and increasing operating efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to offset future inflationary increases in expenses  if any  which would result in a dilutive impact on the company s future earnings 
however  management is actively exploring a variety of e commerce and internet based strategies to reduce potential future operating costs and gain the benefit of potential efficiencies through the use of appropriate technology
