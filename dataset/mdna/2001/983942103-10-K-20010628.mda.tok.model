item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the discussion in this document contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of the risk factors set forth above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we were founded in and  since our inception  have manufactured surface mount assemblies and performed other manufacturing services for oems in the electronics industry 
the development and growth of our business have generally followed the trend by oems in the electronics industry to outsource all or a portion of their manufacturing requirements 
in view of this trend  we have developed a range of electronics manufacturing services including product design  development support and advanced prototyping  materials procurement and supply base management  complex surface mount assembly  total system assembly and integration  manufacturing in various production volumes  advanced test engineering and testing  and after market support 
we have sought to forge long term relationships with our customers as a single source provider of comprehensive electronics manufacturing services 
in recent years we have implemented strategies to diversify our customer base  improve profitability  advance our manufacturing technologies and capabilities  broaden our service offerings and expand our manufacturing capacity 
we have continued to adopt advanced technologies  such as flip chip and micro ball grid array  in advance of the continuing emergence and commercial introduction of more complex electronics devices 
in addition  we have expanded into high growth markets requiring low to moderate volume  highly complex manufacturing solutions  and reorganized our service offerings by establishing dedicated service centers and broadening our services in total system assembly  systems integration and order fulfillment 
as a result of these efforts  we have experienced increases in our net sales and profitability in recent quarters  fueled in large part by new relationships that we have developed with networking and telecommunications oems 
in the fiscal year ended march   or fiscal  we derived approximately of our net sales from networking oems and from telecommunications oems 
in addition  the percentage of revenues derived from our largest customer has decreased to of net sales in fiscal  from a peak of of net sales in fiscal we have increased our gross profit margins as a result of our increased asset and labor utilization  higher sales levels  a shift in our mix of services toward higher margin service and cost management 
our annual and quarterly results of operations are affected by the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs and selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
margins also vary based on the type of services we provide 
our fiscal year is the or weeks ending on the saturday nearest to march reference to fiscal  and are to the fiscal years ended march   april  and march   respectively 
all fiscal year periods presented were week periods  except for fiscal which was a week period

sales to our three largest customers for fiscal represented  and  respectively  of total net sales 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal gross margin increased to of sales in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to increased unit production  changes in our mix of services towards lower material content programs  a increase in higher margin value added prototype services  increased utilization of manufacturing assets and labor and other cost management initiatives 
selling general and administrative expenses  or sg a  primarily consist of corporate and sales departmental wages  sales commissions  professional fees  travel and entertainment  outside services and certain depreciation expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher sales levels  associated variable expenses and additional staffing in both our executive offices and our full service operations to manage our sales growth 
sg a expenses represented of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales for fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales reflected the higher sales levels in fiscal and expense management 
recoveries charges  net were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal year  we wrote off amounts outstanding from a financially strained customer a 
we entered into a forbearance agreement with customer a during fiscal year under the provisions of the forbearance agreement  customer a was required to pay substantially all of the entire amount outstanding 
the forbearance arrangement also resulted in issuance of warrants to us to purchase common stock in customer a 
during fiscal year and  we were able to recover substantially all of the amounts outstanding under the forbearance agreement 
during fiscal year  the company also exercised the warrants to acquire and sell common stock in customer a 
due to several factors  including financial difficulties encountered by customer b and turning over the collection from customer b to the company s legal counsel  the company wrote off amounts outstanding from customer b amounting to approximately  during fiscal year we also closed our facilities in california in fiscal  which resulted in expenses amounting to approximately  these expenses relating to severance paid to employees  and impairment of long lived assets 
in fiscal  we expect to incur approximately  in operating losses relating to the operation of this facility through its final closing date of may  other expense  net for fiscal reflected expense of million compared to million for fiscal the change in other expense  net was due to increased interest expense incurred on higher borrowings under our revolving line of credit in fiscal the provision for income taxes of million reflected an effective tax rate of in fiscal and the provision for incomes taxes of  reflected an effective tax rate of in fiscal fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales for fiscal decreased million or  to million from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the discontinuation of certain customer programs which represented million of net sales in fiscal  one of which resulted from a customer transferring a large manufacturing program in house as a part of its restructuring 
this million decrease in net sales was partially offset by the addition of million in sales from new networking segment customers and the expansion of sales to existing customers 
sales to our three largest customers for fiscal represented   and  respectively  of total net sales 
sales to our three largest customers for fiscal represented  and  respectively  of total net sales 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal gross margin increased to of sales in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to changes in our mix of services towards lower material content programs  higher value added services  cost reduction actions and the write down of certain impaired assets in the prior year 
sg a expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to cost controls and lower variable expenses sg a expenses represented of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales reflected the lower sales levels and the implementation of cost controls 
recoveries in fiscal totaled million and were realized from a work out plan with a customer 
the work out plan also resulted in the issuance to us of warrants to acquire shares of the customer s common stock and the recovery of amounts due us in the form of interest 
due to the uncertainty of realization  a value was not recorded for these warrants 
interest was applied to amounts due us and then subsequently to interest income 
in fiscal  other charges consisted of a million special charge to adjust the carrying value of certain non performing assets 
other expense  net for fiscal reflected expense of  compared to  for fiscal the change in other expense  net was due to increased interest expense incurred on our term note and revolving line of credit in fiscal the provision for income taxes of  reflected an effective tax rate of in fiscal and the income tax benefit of million reflected an effective tax rate of in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our working capital was million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal our working capital at march  included cash and cash equivalents of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million in fiscal the year to year variations are due primarily to changes in inventory levels  accounts receivable  sales levels and the net loss incurred in fiscal cash flows used in operating activities during fiscal primarily resulted from higher inventories and accounts receivable balances associated with higher sales levels  partially offset by other changes in working capital 
capital expenditures during fiscal  and were million  million and million 
during fiscal  we increased our capital expenditures to accommodate higher sales level and for leasehold improvements made on our new irving  texas facility 
in connection with our relocation and expansion in irving  texas  in december we entered into a seven year lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility 
the lease requires payments of approximately  per month over the duration of the lease 
as of march   we had a three year revolving loan facility for million that was entered into on march  there was million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at march  we were eligible to borrow an additional million at march  under the revolving loan facility s borrowing formula 
the revolving loan facility provides for automatic renewals for successive terms of equal duration thereafter unless terminated by either party prior to the renewal date 
the revolving loan facility bears interest at libor plus to depending upon our ability to maintain certain financial ratios or prime or prime plus to such rate determined based upon the amounts  financial ratios and period of loans  matures march  and is collateralized by certain of our assets 
the revolving loan facility requires the payment of a monthly commitment fee equal to one quarter of one percent per annum on the unused balance  and borrowings are limited based upon certain collateral availability requirements on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
at march   the availability under our line of credit was negatively impacted by a significant increase in inventory and to a lesser extent an increase in accounts receivable 
we have implemented plans to increase our credit line availability by i reducing new materials purchases  ii requesting certain customers to either purchase inventories in excess of short term manufacturing requirements or to prepay our purchases of inventories on their behalf  and  iii reduce accounts receivable through increased collections efforts 
while we believe that we will be able to achieve our plans  there is no assurance that our objectives will be met 
our financing facilities contain certain restrictions  which among other things  require maintenance of minimum financial ratios 
at march   we were in compliance with the covenants relating to our financing facilities 
while our current forecast shows that we will be able to meet the financial covenants during fiscal and will be able to keep the need for outstanding debt under the maximum ceilings for amounts outstanding  there is no assurance that the forecasts will prove accurate or that the lender s requirements will be able to be met 
there exists the possibility that we will need to obtain additional equity financing  although there is no assurance as to the amount  availability or cost of such financing

the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations

forward looking statements the foregoing management s discussion and analysis contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including  but not limited to  statements regarding growth in sales  profit margins and the sufficiency of our cash flow for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
these forward looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements for these factors  see the third paragraph of the section marked documents incorporated by reference on page two of this document

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we invest our cash in money market funds or other instruments which meet high credit quality standards specified by our investment policy 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
our financing facilities are subject to market risk by way of interest rate fluctuations 
the carrying amount of our long term debt approximates fair value due to the periodic adjustments of our interest rate on the debt to current market rates 
as of march   all of our notes payable and long term debt bore interest at variable rates  generally tied to a reference rate such as libor or prime rate of interest of certain lending institutions 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we would seek to take actions to mitigate our risk exposure
