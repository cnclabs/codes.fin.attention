the increases in net revenues reflect growing demand for san switching products and are the result of increased unit sales to an expanding customer base along with increased sales to several significant oems and system integrator customers

brocade priced these second generation products approximately percent to percent below the prices of its first generation products 
except for the planned price reduction noted above  brocade has not experienced any material price erosion 
the prices of brocade s products could decline in future periods for any number of reasons including competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by brocade or brocade s competitors  or other factors

gross margin increased to percent of net revenues in fiscal  compared with percent in fiscal  and percent in fiscal the increases were primarily due to lower component and manufacturing costs  the allocation of fixed manufacturing costs over a greater revenue base  and an increase in the percentage of sales to higher margin customers
