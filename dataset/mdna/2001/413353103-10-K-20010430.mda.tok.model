 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  with an effective date for periods beginning after june  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no

 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  which amends the accounting and reporting standards of sfas no 
for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes standards for accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate at february   the company had long term debt outstanding of approximately million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the remaining million bears interest at variable rates which averaged approximately during fiscal year a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at february  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change is also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
foreign currency substantially all of the company s purchases are priced in us dollars 
however  some european purchases are denominated in local currency and  therefore  are subject to the fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company utilizes forward exchange contracts to secure firm pricing related to purchase commitments to be denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts are of varying short term durations and amounts include a window delivery feature  which provides the company with an option to enter into a swap agreement in the event that all of the currency is not utilized at the end of the contract s delivery term 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the principal currency hedged is the italian lira 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
the company had no foreign exchange instruments outstanding at february   therefore  a sensitivity analysis would result in no impact to earnings 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during fiscal years  and forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may be preceded or followed by or otherwise include the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  estimates  will  would  could or similar expressions 
such forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current views of future events and financial performance  involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from planned or expected results 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the impact of competition  pricing pressure  product demand and market acceptance risks  mergers and acquisitions  reliance on key strategic alliances  the ability to attract and retain key employees  the availability of cash for growth  fluctuations in operating results  ability to continue funding operating losses  and the ability of new management to improve the company s financial condition and performance 
for all of these reasons  actual results may vary materially from the forward looking statements 
the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements
