item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business is organized into three segments timber  paper and paperboard and converted products 
we benefit from significant integration between our business segments 
during fiscal year  our paper and paperboard segment obtained approximately of its wood chips from logs that were harvested from our timberlands and chipped by our chipping operations 
in the same period  our converted products segment obtained approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill  representing approximately of total mill production 
in addition  our business segments share centralized corporate management  accounting  human resources and information systems support 
our fiscal year ends on october net sales for individual segments are reported net of intercompany transfers 
segment operating profits reflect allocations of selling  general and administrative expenses on the basis of the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
in the case of intercompany transfers of products between segments  cost of products sold is based upon transfer pricing policies that we believe assist us in managing and optimizing the consolidated financial performance of our business as a whole 
for example  when our paper and paperboard segment obtains logs from our timber segment for whole log chipping at our chipping facilities  we assign a transfer price to those logs based upon the historical cost and hauling expenses of the logs  regardless of the market price of those logs or wood chips at the time of transfer 
for paperboard acquired from our paper mill and used in our converting operations  we assign a transfer price equal to the paper mill s cost 
depending on market conditions  our transfer pricing practices may understate or overstate the actual price at which we could have sold those products into the open market or the actual price in the open market at which we could have purchased the raw materials used to produce those products 
as a consequence  these allocations and transfer pricing policies sometimes result in individual segment results that do not reflect the financial performance that would have resulted for a segment operating as a stand alone business 
our timber segment owns and operates timberlands in oregon and washington and produces logs for sale in the domestic and export markets 
during fiscal year  our domestic customers consisted of approximately independent sawmills and plywood plants 
results of operations for our timber segment also include our sawmill 
net sales of our timber segment are primarily affected by housing starts and other construction activity in the domestic and japanese markets 
construction activity is influenced by mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions in those markets 
net sales in this segment are also affected by supply side factors such as government regulation restricting the harvest of timber from public and certain private lands and competition from logs supplied by foreign producers  especially canadian producers 
the strength of the japanese export market can significantly influence the results of our timber segment since our sales into that market tend to be at higher prices than sales into the domestic market 
because all of our sales are us dollar denominated  our export sales are also significantly influenced by the relative strength of the us dollar 
cost of products sold in the timber segment primarily include contract logging expense  the cost of operating our sawmill and depletion  which is based on the historical cost of timber that is harvested 
our paper and paperboard segment produces a wide variety of paper and paperboard at our longview mill 
we sell our paper and paperboard products to a number of domestic and export customers 
in fiscal year  our converted products segment used approximately of our paper and paperboard output 
net sales in the paper and paperboard segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states and southeast asia and the relative strength of the us dollar 
average prices in this segment have also been favorably affected by industry capacity rationalization over the last several years 
the demand for certain specialty products manufactured by our paper and paperboard segment tends to be less dependent on the economic cycles affecting the commodity paper market 
the major component of cost of products sold for the paper and paperboard segment is fiber  which consists primarily of wood chips  but also includes sawdust and recycled materials 
we have recently invested in processes that allow us to use an increased amount of less expensive sawdust and recycled materials in making our paper and paperboard products 
cost of products sold also includes labor  energy and chemicals used in processing 
our converted products segment produces corrugated containers  solid fiber boxes  creative point of purchase displays  handle shopping bags and merchandise bags 
nearly all of our converted products are sold domestically for end uses that include packaging for consumables such as fresh and frozen produce and beverages  as well as for toys  furniture and electronics 
net sales in the converted products segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states 
the primary constituent materials for converted products are paper and paperboard 
our converted products segment obtains approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill at mill cost 
cost of products sold also includes energy  labor  ink and glue 
our longview mill contains six steam driven generators and one natural gas fired co generation facility  all of which are capable of producing electric power 
during fiscal year  we elected  based on the relationship between rates we could obtain for third party sales of electricity and the cost to us of purchasing electricity and natural gas  to sell a significant percentage of the electricity that we generated into the market 
as a result  we realized million from net sales of electric power during the period 
the operating profit from power sales allocated to our paper and paperboard segment was million in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year the operating profit allocated to our converted products segment was million in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year we made allocations between those segments based on the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
the operating profit of those segments for fiscal year  net of the contribution from power sales  does not reflect the results that we would have obtained for those segments in the absence of our decision to sell power externally 
these sales had the effect of significantly increasing our energy costs for operation as well as increasing our requirements for natural gas used to fuel the co generation facility 
our power sales decreased during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year primarily due to decreased prices available to us in the electric power market 
our future decisions concerning electric power generation  including the extent to which we operate our co generation facility for sales into the market  will change from period to period based on market conditions 
however  the primary contracts pursuant to which we purchased and sold power in the past have expired and  under new terms  we have significantly less flexibility in selling and using power generated by our facilities 
we do not expect sales of power to meaningfully contribute to our results in the coming year 
we can curtail the operation of certain of our equipment and facilities from time to time to provide us with flexibility in managing our operations and cost structure 
under certain market conditions  we may fully or partially curtail the operation of one or more of the paper machines at our longview mill 
when we curtail a machine  we typically switch production from the curtailed machine to maximize the efficient use of other machines that we would not otherwise fully utilize 
in addition  we may curtail the operation of certain of our converting facilities if we believe it is advantageous to do so

fiscal year net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year net sales remained relatively unchanged as a result of an incremental million of opportunistic net sales of internally generated power to third parties on economically favorable terms  offset by a decrease in net sales in our paper and paperboard segments of million  or  and in our converted products segment of million  or 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a increase in average wood chip costs and a increase in average natural gas costs at the longview mill  which were partially due to increased power sales discussed above 
these were partially offset by an approximately decrease in average occ costs and high margins on power sales 
our cost of products sold includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year  compared with million for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to salary increases including market adjustments  the opening of our new bowling green  kentucky converting plant and costs associated with our business process improvement plan

the price decline was in part due to a soft japanese housing market and adverse us dollar to japanese yen exchange rates 
weak export market prices significantly influence our average prices as export prices tend to be significantly higher than domestic prices 
the volume increases were largely due to relatively strong demand in the domestic market  where prices  although lower overall in fiscal year  improved from levels in the first half of the year  as well as to greater timber harvesting in as a result of improved logging conditions over those experienced in fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales compared with million  or  for fiscal year this decrease was a result of export price and volume declines 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reason for this decline was a decrease in average log and lumber prices  partially offset by an increase in log and lumber volume due to relatively strong demand in the domestic market and less curtailment of harvesting in fiscal year  which resulted in some shifting of export sales to domestic sales 
paper and paperboard year ended october  percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating profit  millions paper  tons   paperboard  tons   paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in paper and paperboard volume  along with a decrease in paperboard pricing  partially offset by an increase in paper pricing 
paperboard volume decreased by primarily as a result of our decision not to sell into the asian market at prices that were depressed due to a general worsening of business conditions in asia and the strength of the us dollar 
in addition  chinese and other asian producers added kraft top recycled linerboard capacity that tended to reduce export kraft linerboard prices 
as a result of our decision  we have fully curtailed our least efficient paperboard machine in addition to curtailing two other machines to match production with incoming orders 
fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or  of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year paper volume decreased as a result of a general economic slowdown in the us market and increased competition from european producers in the export market due to  among other things  strength in the us dollar 
however  paper prices increased due to a change in our product mix as we continued to increase sales of tea kraft tm paper in the domestic market and other value added products 
fiscal year paper and paperboard operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year operating profits were negatively impacted by a increase in the average cost of wood chips 
in fiscal year  residual wood chip costs increased and we used a greater proportion of more expensive wood chips from whole log chipping operations 
we have since reduced our use of whole log chips and are taking advantage of lower cost residual chips 
operating profits were also negatively affected by increased costs caused by low machine utilization rates in the first half of fiscal year and higher energy prices 
operating profits were favorably impacted by the profits from the sale of electrical power allocated to the paper and paperboard segment 
we allocated million to the segment operating profit as a result of power sales in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year the basis for this allocation was consistent with the method used to allocate identifiable assets and other costs between segments 
these sales had the effect of significantly increasing our energy costs for operation of the paper and paperboard segment as well as increasing our requirements for natural gas used to fuel the co generation facility 
due to the increased sale of power in fiscal year  plus the increased cost of natural gas  energy costs increased from to of paper and paperboard and converted products net sales including allocated power sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
however  energy prices have decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we expect decreased sales of energy into the market in fiscal year the longview mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year converted products year ended october  percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating profit  millions converted products  tons   converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume decreased due to general softening of the economy 
converted product pricing was favorably impacted by increased sales of value added products such as point of purchase displays and higher quality print orders 
our specialty products  which we identify as print jobs with four colors or more  jobs with a high percentage of die cuts and other enumerated converted products  represented of our converted products net sales for fiscal year  compared with for fiscal year fiscal year converted products operating profit was million  compared with million for the fiscal year operating profits were negatively impacted by the increased cost of paper and paperboard supplied to us by the longview mill and increased converting costs  including labor and converting supplies  offset by the favorable impact of the profits from the sale of electrical power allocated to the converted products segment 
the increase in paper and paperboard cost was due to the longview mill s increased cost of wood chips and natural gas and power related costs described above and the increased costs due to a lower operating rate at the mill 
the average mill cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting plants increased by for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year the increased cost was also partially attributable to the increased use of high quality paperboard used in manufacturing value added products 
we allocated million to the segment operating profit as a result of power sales in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase was attributable to an increase in paper and paperboard net sales of million  or  converted products net sales of million  or  and new power sales of million  offset by a decrease in net sales in our timber segment of million  or 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to improved margins resulting from an increase in prices in most of our segments and a decrease in depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
expense for depreciation  depletion and amortization amounted to million for fiscal year  compared with million for fiscal year this change resulted primarily from the extension of the depreciable lives of our major equipment following a study we conducted to assess the average useful life of certain of our capital assets and to approximate industry standards 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year the decrease as a percentage of net sales was partially due to an increase in net sales due to pricing increases in most of our segments 
this decrease was offset by an increase in our converted products sales force and other staff  in conjunction with the expansion of our converting plants in and our focus on marketing specialty  value added converted products  coupled with salary increases and increased training costs 
operating profit 
fiscal year operating profit was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase was attributable to a million increase in paper and paperboard operating profit  and million increase in converted products operating profit  offset by a million decrease in timber operating profit

domestic log volume and prices decreased as a result of the deterioration of domestic demand throughout the year  while export prices increased overall in fiscal year  with export volume remaining stable 
fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year prices in the domestic lumber markets declined throughout most of the period primarily due to an increase in canadian lumber exports 
lumber volume increased despite falling prices due to our decision to maintain certain customer relationships 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reason for this decline was a decrease in log volume and lumber prices and  to a lesser extent  higher logging expenses  costs associated with installing a new saw in our sawmill and increased depletion costs related to the mix of timber harvested in paper and paperboard year ended october  percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard sales  millions paper and paperboard operating profit  millions n a paper  tons   paperboard  tons   paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increases in average paper and paperboard prices of and  respectively 
the price increases were primarily due to lower domestic inventories resulting from the rationalization of paper machines following industry consolidation in and the curtailment of paper machines by a number of manufacturers 
additionally  we continued to increase our domestic sales of specialty  value added products such as tea kraft tm paper through a targeted marketing effort 
paper volume increased by primarily due to sales of tea kraft tm paper and sales to new canadian customers that we established during fiscal year the paper volume increase was offset by a decrease in paperboard volume 
we significantly increased export sales of corrugated medium and linerboard in fiscal year following improved demand and constrained supply 
as a result of deteriorating margins on these products due to strong competition and weak prices  we significantly reduced export paperboard volume in fiscal year fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or  of paper and paperboard net sales compared with million  or  in fiscal year fiscal year paper and paperboard operating profit was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year operating profits were favorably impacted by higher prices  increased domestic sales of value added products such as tea kraft tm paper and significantly reduced export sales of low margin corrugated medium and linerboard 
this favorable impact to operating profits was partially offset by increased wood chip and energy costs 
average wood chip costs were about higher in fiscal year than in the prior fiscal year 
the average cost of occ  a significant source of this segment s raw materials  was higher in fiscal year compared with fiscal year due to increased prices resulting from unusually high demand for occ 
for fiscal year  these two raw materials combined represented approximately of our total segment cost of products produced  not including shipping  warehousing and outward freight  compared with approximately for fiscal year the average cost of electricity and natural gas increased approximately and  respectively  for fiscal year compared with fiscal year the longview mill operated at approximately of capacity during fiscal year compared with approximately during fiscal year converted products year ended october  percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating profit  millions n a converted products  tons   converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increases in volume of and an increase in price of 
although general corrugated container demand was relatively flat for fiscal year  we believe our volume improved due in large part to our efforts to expand specialty  value added product sales through an increased focus on marketing specialty products and increased value placed by customers on the quality and service we provide 
in the middle of fiscal year  we were also successful in implementing price increases for most of our converted products 
in fiscal year  our specialty products represented of net average sales  compared with for fiscal year fiscal year converted products operating profit was million  compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal year the primary reasons for the improvement were the price and volume increases  partially offset by increases in the cost of producing paperboard supplied from the longview mill as described above  and increases in wages and the hiring of additional sales representatives at our converting plants 
liquidity and capital resources at october   our financial position included long term debt of million  including current installments of long term debt of million 
additionally  short term borrowings at october  were million 
net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in operating profits 
the decrease in fiscal year was largely the result of increased pension and other noncurrent assets 
net cash used for investing was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year our capital expenditures  including timberland acquisitions  were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we started a capital program to enable us to increase our domestic converted products business in an effort to reduce our reliance on the competitive export paperboard market 
significant capital expenditures in included the construction of our new bowling green  kentucky converting plant  purchasing of flexo folder gluers  expansion of the material handling system and other equipment upgrades at our spanish fork  utah converting plant  upgrading our amsterdam  new york converting facility by expanding the building  increasing the corrugator s capacity and purchasing a flexo folder gluer  and the completion of the replacement of the press section of a paper machine which began in significant capital expenditures in fiscal year included the purchase of a corrugator for our spanish fork converting plant  the construction of our seward  nebraska converting plant  the rebuilding of a paper machine  and the commencement of work to replace the press section on a paper machine 
in fiscal year  we made lower capital expenditures as a result of lower operating profits and our ability to curtail investing based on prior year s expenditures 
capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million for each of fiscal years and  including expenditures for timber purchases  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance 
net cash provided by financing was million in fiscal year  while the net cash used for financing was million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the change in fiscal year primarily reflects a million increase in borrowings during fiscal year to fund capital expenditures such as the construction of our bowling green  kentucky converting plant and the purchase of founders stock for million 
debt increased by million in fiscal year and decreased by million in fiscal year the reduction in our debt in was due to a reduced level of capital expenditures from previous years  and an increase in operating profit and a decrease in interest expense over the same period  which allowed more of our cash to be used to repay our debt 
during fiscal years and  we purchased a total of  shares of our stock for approximately million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year we did not purchase shares of our stock 
each quarter we determine the amount of our dividend based on operating results  current market conditions and debt levels 
cash dividends of per share were declared and paid in the fourth quarter of in the aggregate amount of million 
during fiscal year  we declared and paid total dividends of per share  for an aggregate amount of million 
dividends of and per share were paid in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively  for an aggregate amount of million and million  respectively 
the board of directors declared a dividend of per share to be paid on january  to shareholders of record on december  the reduction was based on fourth quarter earnings and current economic conditions that are negatively affecting our business 
at october   we had bank lines of credit totaling million 
of this amount  million was provided by a group of banks under a credit agreement expiring in february at october   we had million outstanding under this agreement 
in addition  at october   we had an outstanding balance of million under the remaining million of our lines of credit 
also outstanding at october   were various senior notes totaling million  which includes a million senior note offering that closed during the third quarter  and revenue bonds of million 
our financing arrangements require us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  short and long term borrowing ratio  current ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and restrict our payment of dividends 
in december  we decided to refinance our million and million lines of credit and million of our senior notes 
we anticipate that we will enter into a new million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and privately place million of senior subordinated notes with institutional investors in january the refinancing transactions are contingent upon a number of factors  including market conditions 
for the quarter ended april   we obtained amendments from the holders of certain senior notes with respect to compliance with covenants that require us to maintain a specified current ratio 
the amendments affected the quarters ended april  and july  as of june  when we closed a senior note offering  we were in full compliance with all financial covenants of the original note agreements without regard to the amendments 
as a result of amendments to certain senior notes obtained in  we continue to pay an additional per annum over the original note coupon rates until an investment grade credit rating is obtained for our unsecured debt 
other during the year ended october   we adjusted the estimated useful lives of some capital assets 
as a result of an updated comparison of the estimated useful lives for various asset categories of certain companies in the industry and further study of our own asset base  we adjusted the estimated useful lives of our machinery and equipment for fiscal year the estimated useful lives now range from to years for buildings and principally from to years for machinery and equipment 
these changes increased fiscal and fiscal net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
we continually review any known environmental exposures including the cost of remediation 
at the present time  we are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality  the environmental protection agency epa has issued a final air and water quality rule referred to as the cluster rule 
we estimate that over the next years required pollution control capital expenditures could range from million to million 
we have included these estimated expenditures in our capital expenditure budget discussed above 
although future pollution control expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty and could continue to escalate because of continuing changes in laws and regulations and uncertainty as to how they will be interpreted and applied  we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
as part of an industry supported effort  forestry regulations have been developed in oregon and washington to protect salmon 
these regulations restrict the harvest of timber near streams and other environmentally sensitive areas  thereby reducing the timber that can be harvested and increasing costs 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
we do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives 
factors that may affect our future operating results you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report 
they are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
cyclical industry conditions and commodity pricing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results reflect the general cyclical pattern of the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
most of our products are commodity products and are subject to competition from other timber companies and paper and paperboard products manufacturers worldwide 
historically  prices for our products have been volatile  and we  like other participants in the forest  paper and packaging products industries  have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand in the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
product supply is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
demand is affected by the state of the economy in general and a variety of other factors 
the demand for our timber is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity and home repair and remodeling activity 
demand for our paper and packaging products is primarily affected by the state of the global economy in general and the economies in north america and east asia in particular 
due to generally weak worldwide economic conditions  especially in our main export market  asia  global demand for our paper and paperboard products has generally declined 
a prolonged and severe weakness in the markets for one or more of our principal products could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our cash requirements  including the payment of interest and principal on our debt 
our industries are highly competitive and subject to wide price fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the forest  paper and packaging products industries are highly competitive globally  and no single company is dominant 
these industries have suffered from excess capacity and are also capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs 
our competitors include large  vertically integrated forest  paper and packaging products companies and numerous smaller companies 
larger companies that compete with us in each of our markets may be better able to withstand the adverse nature of the business cycle because they may have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past year  we have seen significant competition in the japanese timber market as european competitors have benefited from the strength of the us dollar relative to the euro 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition and volatility within our industry  especially during periods of reduced demand 
future decreases in prices for our products would adversely affect our operating results 
these factors  coupled with our substantial leveraged position  may harm our ability to respond to competition and other market conditions 
pricing in the us softwood lumber industry has been impacted historically by canadian exports into the united states 
in  the softwood lumber agreement  a five year quota accord  was put in place in an attempt to reduce canadian softwood lumber exports to the united states 
the agreement taxed exports that exceeded certain levels from the canadian provinces of british columbia  alberta  ontario and quebec 
despite the quota  exports from canada to the united states increased each year the quota was in effect as shipments from other canadian provinces rose sharply 
following the expiration of the softwood lumber agreement in march  exports of canadian softwood lumber into the united states have increased 
according to the american pulp and paper association  from april through august  imports of canadian softwood lumber into the united states increased by compared with the same period in at the request of us lumber producers  the us department of commerce introduced a temporary countervailing duty on august  on lumber shipments from the four canadian provinces originally affected by the softwood lumber agreement 
on october   an additional anti dumping tariff  which applies to all canadian producers  was introduced as a result of an investigation that identified six canadian producers selling lumber into the united states at prices below production costs 
the temporary countervailing duty expired december  however  the department of commerce is continuing to review whether to impose a new countervailing duty 
the anti dumping tariff is expected to remain in place until a final decision is made regarding the duty 
price fluctuations in raw materials could adversely affect our ability to obtain the materials needed to manufacture our products 
the most significant raw material used in our operations is fiber  including wood  recycled and other fiber  which during fiscal year accounted for of our costs of products produced in our paper and paperboard segment  not including shipping  warehousing and outward freight 
we obtained approximately of our wood fiber requirements at open market prices during fiscal year we also obtained almost all of our recycled fiber on the open market 
wood and recycled fiber are both subject to commodity pricing  which fluctuates on the basis of market factors over which we have no control 
in addition  the cost of fiber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly because of economic or industry conditions  particularly the conditions in the pacific northwest  where we purchase most of our fiber 
further  our access to wood fiber could be adversely affected by consolidation of sawmills in the pacific northwest that supply wood fiber to our longview mill  as well as more stringent environmental or other regulations affecting the supply or cost of timber to those sawmills 
we may not be able to pass any future raw material cost increases through to our customers through product price increases 
our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our operations require substantial capital and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
our operations require substantial capital 
capital requirements for expansion  replacement and maintenance of existing facilities or equipment or to comply with existing and future changes in environmental laws and regulations may be substantial 
although we maintain our equipment with regular periodic and scheduled maintenance  we cannot assure you that key pieces of equipment will not need to be repaired or replaced or that we will not incur significant additional costs associated with environmental compliance 
the costs of repairing or replacing equipment and the associated downtime of an affected production line could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
if our future capital resources are inadequate to provide for our operating needs  capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures and liabilities 
our businesses are subject to many federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the restoration and reforestation of timberlands  harvesting timber near waterways  discharges of pollutants and emissions  and the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances or other contaminants 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business and we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenditures to remain in compliance 
we expect that the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject will become more stringent and more stringently enforced in the future 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
investigations may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated  and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities 
consequently  we cannot assure you that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination  including unanticipated discovery of contamination or discharges of hazardous substances  will not require significant expenditures by us or that internally generated funds or other sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
some environmental laws permit individuals  citizens groups and other third parties to file claims against us based upon alleged violations of laws or damages to property stemming from contamination  or upon alleged injury to persons stemming from exposure to hazardous substances used or otherwise controlled by us 
we may be required to expend significant sums to defend and or settle existing or future claims 
natural disasters or other events may cause losses to our timber holdings or limit our ability to harvest our timber 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be limited by natural disasters and other events such as fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding  other weather conditions and other causes 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  as is typical in the industry  we do not maintain insurance for any loss of our standing timber from natural disasters or other causes 
in addition  fire and other natural disasters in adjacent or nearby timberlands may limit our access to  or impede our ability to harvest  our timber 
in periods of poor logging conditions  we may harvest less timber than expected  thus impacting our net sales of timber during that period 
high energy costs could adversely affect our results of operations 
through the first three quarters of fiscal year  energy had become an increasingly variable operating expense for us as a result of rapid and substantial price increases that began in mid and continued in we have not been able  and in the future may not be able  to pass all increased energy costs through to our customers 
in addition  the primary contracts pursuant to which we advantageously purchased and sold power in the past have expired and  under new terms  we have significantly less flexibility in our ability to sell and use power generated by our facilities 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in fluctuations in demand for our products 
while all of our revenues are earned in us dollars  a large portion of our sales are made to customers operating in markets that use currencies other than us dollars 
for the fiscal year  exports accounted for over of our total sales 
of this amount  of our total sales came from timber export sales  primarily to japan  and of our total sales came from export sales of paper and paperboard  primarily to hong kong  canada and southeast asia 
strength in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries could make it more expensive for our customers operating in foreign markets to purchase our products  could make our products less price competitive with our foreign competitors  and could consequently reduce the demand for our products 
a reduction in demand for our products could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  adverse currency valuations could make paper and paperboard from foreign competitors more price competitive in the us market 
this situation has caused  and from time to time in the future may cause  excess supply of paper and paperboard in the united states  which  in turn  will likely result in a decrease in us paper and paperboard prices 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
approximately  of our employees  or over of our workforce  are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  there is a risk of work stoppage due to strikes or walkouts 
we have collective bargaining agreements expiring at various times through calendar year  including three agreements covering approximately employees that will expire during calendar year any significant work stoppage as a result of the failure to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acts of terrorism or war and any military or economic response by the united states may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
the united states was recently the victim of several acts of terrorism 
these acts have disrupted the functioning of the financial markets and numerous other businesses 
the united states has responded with military actions and is expected to continue to use military force 
although we believe we have thus far experienced minimal disruption of our business  the potential near and long term impacts on us are difficult to assess 
however  we would likely be adversely affected by those events to the extent those military actions or future terrorist acts or responses to terrorist acts contribute to the weakening of the us or international economies 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single acre complex in longview  washington 
since we do not have pulp and paper production elsewhere  a material disruption at our mill could result in a material disruption of our paper making operations 
such disruptions could be caused by prolonged power failures  a breakdown of our continuous pulp digesters  chemical spill or release  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including railroad tracks  bridges  tunnels and roads  or fires  floods  earthquakes or other disasters 
although we currently have certain business insurance and replacement value insurance  we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover the total amount of any losses caused by any of the above events 
in addition  we are not insured against any losses due to interruptions in our business due to damage to or destruction of our longview pulp and paper making complex caused by earthquakes or to major transportation infrastructure disruptions or other events that do not occur on our premises 
a disruption in our pulp and paper operations would also adversely affect our converting plants  which in fiscal year obtained approximately of their paper and paperboard requirements from our mill 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has not engaged in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engaged in transactions involving market risk sensitive instruments 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall
