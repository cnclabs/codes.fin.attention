overview we design  develop and market software for service organizations in large enterprises 
service organizations include internal information technology  or it  departments  consulting organizations  product development groups  and other organizations rendering services inside and outside the enterprise 
our software allows teams within these organizations to manage people and projects  to capture and reuse knowledge and to account for project related activities 
our software also provides executives and managers with visibility into projects  project portfolios and businesses  enabling informed decision making 
we believe that our software enables service organizations to deliver results more efficiently and effectively  thereby securing a competitive advantage 
we derive revenue principally from licenses of our niku enterprise manager and niku portfolio manager products  maintenance and support and delivery of implementation services 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force 
we also sell our products indirectly through channel partners such as value added resellers 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant niku obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sales to value added resellers are recognized upon sell through to the end user customer 
we consider fees relating to arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method 
the determination of the fair value of maintenance and support and of consulting services is based on objective evidence that is specific to us 
the residual value of arrangements is allocated to the software licenses 
arrangements that include consulting services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
when services are considered essential  license and service revenue under the arrangement is recognized as the services are performed 
when services are not considered essential  the revenue allocable to the consulting services is recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance and support revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service period  which is typically one year 
license revenue includes product licenses to companies from which we have purchased products and services under separate arrangements executed within a short period of time reciprocal arrangements 
products and services purchased in reciprocal arrangements include software licensed for our internal use  software licensed for resale or incorporation into our products  and development or implementation services 
for reciprocal arrangements  we consider accounting principles board  or apb  no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 nonmonetary transactions magnitude of boot and exceptions to the use of fair value  interpretation of accounting principles board no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to determine whether the arrangement is a monetary or nonmonetary transaction 
transactions involving the exchange of boot representing or greater of the fair value of the reciprocal arrangement are considered monetary transactions within the context of apb no 
and eitf issue no 
monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions that represent the culmination of an earnings process are recorded at the fair value of the products delivered or products or services received  whichever is more readily determinable  providing these fair values are determinable within reasonable limits 
in determining these fair values  we consider the recent history of cash sales of the same products or services in similar sized transactions 
for nonmonetary reciprocal arrangements that do not represent the culmination of the earnings process  the exchange is recorded based on the carrying value of the products delivered  generally zero 
revenue recognized under reciprocal arrangements was approximately million and million during the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively  of which approximately  and million  respectively  involved nonmonetary exchanges 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue have not been recognized 
deferred revenue generally results from the following deferred maintenance and support  consulting services not yet rendered  and amounts billed to customers with extended payment terms  which amounts are not yet due 
on august   we acquired abt corporation  a privately held company located in new york city  new york

we also issued options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
in addition  we will issue options to purchase up to  shares of our common stock on august   at which time the then fair value of the options will be recorded as additional goodwill and amortized over the remaining useful life of the goodwill 
of the total purchase price of the transaction  million was allocated to the net tangible liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  million was allocated to goodwill and million was allocated to other intangible assets  representing million for customer lists  million for developed and core technologies and million for assembled workforce

subsequent to january   our stock price has continued to decline 
due to these changes  along with changes in the markets in which we compete and the united states and global economy  we have begun a process to determine whether the respective fair values of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be less than their respective carrying values 
this process will include a detailed analysis of estimated cash flows that we expect to generate from future operations for purposes of determining whether an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred 
if  as a result of our detailed analysis and investigation  we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles assets  the carrying value of these assets will be written down to their fair values as a charge against our operating results in the period that the determination is made

interest and other income  net  consists of interest income  interest expense and other non operating expenses 
the net increase was primarily attributable to higher average invested cash and short term investment balances  which yielded higher interest income in fiscal than in fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations through private sales of capital stock  with net proceeds of million through january   through our initial public offering of common stock in february  with net proceeds of million and from bank loans and equipment leases

in september  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution providing a line of credit of up to million 
this line of credit was subsequently increased to million in july and to million in january as of january   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the line of credit 
interest on this line of credit accrues at a rate of per annum 
the line of credit was repaid in full in february we also entered into a lease financing arrangement providing a lease line of credit of up to million which we have utilized in full 
we anticipate that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that cash from operations and existing cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital and expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we have entered into arrangements to pay royalties to third parties in exchange for the right to resell their products or integrate their software into our products

as of january   we have prepaid royalties of approximately million and we are also committed to pay additional minimum royalties of approximately million 
these royalties will be amortized to cost of license revenue when our products incorporating the license of third party software are sold to our customers 
we have currently resold some of these products or incorporated them into our products 
if we are not able to incorporate these technologies into our products or our products incorporating these technologies do not achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to realize the carrying value of our prepaid royalties 
in addition  we could be required to pay further royalties even if we do not generate revenue from the sale of the third party technology or from the license of products incorporating that technology 
in february  a vendor to which we prepaid a portion of our royalties experienced a change in control 
as a result of this change in circumstances  there is additional uncertainty as to whether the amounts prepaid by us will be fully realizable 
should we determine that a portion of our prepaid royalties associated with this vendor is not realizable  it would result in a charge to our operations in the first quarter of fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
effective february  management has determined that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america and  to a lesser extent  europe and the asia pacific region 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as a majority of our sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar may make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not expect any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to movements in any specific foreign currency as our operating expenses in each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses by our european and asia pacific subsidiaries 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and outstanding debt obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our investments consist primarily of highly liquid debt instruments that are of high quality investment grade and mature in one year or less  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
due to the short term nature of our investments and the short term and variable interest rate features of our indebtedness  we believe that there is no material market or interest rate risk exposure
