overview the company markets  sells and finances timeshare ownership interests in the form of vacation credits and fractional interests and acquires  develops and manages the worldmark and worldmark south pacific resorts 
the company derives revenue primarily from the sale of vacation credits and fractional interests  from the financing of vacation credits and fractional interests and from management fees generated from its management agreement with the clubs 
vacation credit  fractional interests and upgrade sales are recognized on the accrual basis after the company has received an executed sales contract and a minimum down payment  and the rescission period generally three to fourteen days has passed 
until both of these conditions are met  the customer has no membership rights in the clubs 
in instances where the company finances an upgrade sale and the customer does not make an additional cash down payment of at least of the upgrade sale  the company uses the installment method to recognize revenue 
under the installment method  gross profit on such upgrade sale is deferred and thereafter recognized in relation to each principal payment received 
revenue is fully recognized on the upgrade sale when the principal collected related to the upgrade sale totals of the amount of the upgrade sale 
in  of upgrade sales had the additional cash down payment  as compared to in the company acquires or develops additional resort units for the clubs and contributes those units to the clubs free of monetary encumbrances  thereby creating additional vacation credits for sale by the company 
the company also acquires or develops resort units for fractional interest sales 
these units are not contributed to the clubs 
the company assigns each resort unit a specific number of vacation credits based on its vacation use value relative to existing resort units 
acquisition and construction costs associated with the resort units are recorded as inventory 
vacation credit and fractional interest cost of sales are allocated as sales are recognized 
financing is provided by trendwest at an interest rate of or per annum for a term of up to seven years for vacation credits and an interest rate of up to per annum for a term of up to ten years for fractional interest sales 
the company routinely sells notes receivable to financial institutions and other investors to generate liquidity to acquire or develop new resort units and for working capital 
the company recognizes a gain on the sale of notes receivable at the time of sale equal to the excess of the proceeds received cash plus residual interest in notes receivable sold over the allocated carrying value of the notes receivable sold 
residual interest in notes receivable sold represents the present value of the estimated net future cash flows of the payment streams  resulting from the sale of notes receivable  and is carried at fair value with the changes in fair value included in finance income

the company continually needs to acquire and develop additional resort units for the clubs in order to provide additional vacation credits for sale by the company and to provide a greater variety of resort locations for owners 
the continued growth of the company and increase in the owner base allows for the development of larger resorts which provides certain economies of scale to the company and to the clubs from an operating cost standpoint 
the permitting process for larger resorts can be lengthy at times and necessitates the need to acquire land as much as to months before a resort is completed 
the company s investment in inventory increased to million at december   from million at december  at december   there were resort projects in various stages of development  including resorts larger in scale than historical experience 
inventory levels in were too low to sustain future growth  requiring additional investments in more resort development projects in  as well as in standing inventory 
at december   there were million vacation credits available for sale 
with the completion of current projects in progress  the acquisition of new resorts and the expansion of existing resorts  the company believes it will have an adequate supply of credits available to meet its planned growth through the early part of the year since all vacation credits have the same use rights and the same listed selling price  the company does not experience a buildup of inventory of less desirable resort units or interval dates which are difficult to sell 
since completed units at various resort properties are acquired or developed in advance and a significant portion of the purchase price of vacation credits is financed by the company  the company continually needs funds to acquire and develop property  to carry notes receivable contracts and to provide working capital 
the company has historically secured additional funds through the sale of notes receivable through the finance subsidiaries  borrowings on the million line of credit and loans from the parent
