cost of software licenses consists of commissions paid to third parties in connection with joint marketing and other related agreements 
royalty fees associated with third party software 
costs related to user documentation 
costs related to reproduction and delivery of software 
cost of software licenses as a percentage of related revenue was in  in and in cost of software license increased million  or  in and million  or  in the increases in cost of software licenses  both as a percentage of software license revenue and in dollar amount  are due to increases in commissions paid to third parties in connection with joint marketing efforts and other sales assistance  and increases in the amount of royalty fees associated with third party software 
cost of services and maintenance 
cost of services and maintenance includes costs associated with the implementation of software solutions and consulting and training services 
cost of services and maintenance also includes the cost of providing software maintenance to customers such as telephone support and packaging and shipping costs related to new releases of software and updated user documentation 
cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of related revenues was in  in and in the decrease in cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of related revenues over the comparable periods resulted from efficiencies developed in project management and other cost saving measures 
the total cost of services and maintenance increased million  or  in and million  or  in the increases were due to increases in the number of consultants  product support and training staff and increased use of third party consultants to provide implementation services 
as a means to expand into different geographic and vertical markets  we expect to increase the number of our consulting  product support and training personnel in the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  and promotional events such as trade shows  seminars  technical conferences  advertising and public relations programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in the increases were due to we increased the number of our direct sales representatives to at december   up from at december  and at december  this represents a increase in our direct sales force in and a increase in increased sales commissions due to higher revenues 
increased marketing and promotional activities due to the expansion of our suite of e business solutions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of continued software development and product enhancements to existing software 
software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
to date  the establishment of technological feasibility of our products and general release of such software has substantially coincided 
as a result  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant  therefore  we have not capitalized any software development costs 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in and in the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues resulted from our ability to leverage our resource base to support a larger organization 
the increases in the dollar amount of research and development expenses were due to increased research and development personnel by approximately in and approximately in as of december   our research and development headcount totaled approximately  up from approximately  at december  and approximately at december  included in the  headcount total for research and development at december  were approximately employees added by the acquisition of aspect and approximately employees added by the acquisition of supplybase 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include the personnel and other costs of our finance  legal  accounting  human resources  information systems and executive departments 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in and in the increases in the dollar amounts of general and administrative expenses were primarily due to the cost of supporting a increase in personnel in and an increase in  as well as increases in the number and size of our facilities and equipment related to our new corporate headquarters 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues resulted from our ability to leverage our resource base to support a larger organization 
we expect total general and administrative expenses to increase in the foreseeable future due to further growth and expansion of the company 
amortization of intangibles 
from time to time  we have sought to supplement the expanding depth and breadth of our product offerings through technology or business acquisitions 
when an acquisition of a business is accounted for using the purchase method  the amount of the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
any excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is amortized over the life of the asset typically two to three years 
details of our acquisitions are presented in note business combinations and note asset acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
amortization of intangibles  including amortization of goodwill  related to the acquisitions referenced above totaled billion  or of total revenues  in under current accounting guidance  amortization of these intangibles will continue through in february  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision to a previously issued exposure draft covering business combinations proposing new accounting guidance related to goodwill that would change the amortization methodology 
see note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in process research and development and acquisition related expenses 
technology or business acquisitions may include the purchase of technology that has not yet been determined to be technologically feasible and has no alternative future use in its then current stage of development 
in such instances  and in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines  the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development is expensed immediately upon the consummation of the acquisition 
details of in process research and development and acquisition related expenses are presented in note business combinations and note asset acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the write off of acquired in process research and development increased to of total revenues in from in and in in  this increase is related to the acquisitions of supplybase  aspect and various ibm assets 
in  the charges primarily consisted of acquisition expenses related to smart  and in  the charges consisted mostly of acquisition expenses related to itls 
we expect to continue to expand through acquisitions and the resulting write off of process research and development could vary significantly from year to year 
other income  net other income  net  consists of interest income on investments partially offset by interest expense  realized gains losses on equity investments  foreign currency exchange transaction gains losses and other miscellaneous income and expense 
other income  net  was of total revenues in  in and in other income  net  increased million  or  in the increase was attributable to the combination of higher average investment balances and overall market interest rates offset by a full year s interest expense on our convertible notes and net foreign currency exchange transaction losses 
the interest yields on investments and the relative exchange values of foreign currencies are influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the governments in the countries we operate 
the nature  timing and extent of any impact on our financial statements resulting from changes in those governments policies are not predictable 
non cash settlement on october   we settled a lawsuit filed by a former employee alleging his right to exercise stock options granted to him in while he was employed by us  prior to the initial public offering of our stock 
the settlement resulted in the recognition of a million non cash  pre tax charge during the third quarter of in a separate matter  an employee of a company we acquired in is currently disputing the cancellation of stock options received at the time of the acquisition 
vesting of these options was dependent upon continued employment  however  the employment was terminated in we maintain the former employee was not entitled to unvested stock options 
provision for income taxes we recognized income tax expense in despite our net loss before income taxes  resulting in a negative effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in the effective income tax rate in  and to a lesser extent in and  differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill  in process research and development and acquisition related expenses 
other items affecting our effective tax rate during the periods presented include state taxes net of federal tax benefits  non deductible meals and entertainment  deferred tax asset valuation allowances and research and development tax credits 
excluding the impact of these and other items  our effective tax rates were in  in and in basic and diluted earnings per common share basic and diluted earnings per common share is computed in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  which requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for entities with complex capital structures 
basic earnings per common share is based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of stock options and warrants granted using the treasury stock method  the effect of contingently issuable shares earned during the year and shares issuable under the conversion feature of our convertible notes using the if converted method 
future weighted average shares outstanding calculations will be impacted by the following factors the ongoing issuance of common stock associated with stock option exercises 
the issuance of common shares associated with our employee stock purchase plans 
any fluctuations in our stock price  which could cause changes in the number of common stock equivalents included in the diluted earnings per common share calculation 
the issuance of common stock to effect business combinations should we enter into such transactions 
the issuance of common stock or warrants to effect joint marketing  joint development or other similar arrangements should we enter into such arrangements 
assumed or actual conversions of debt into common stock with respect to our convertible notes 
pro forma results of operations the following summary of unaudited pro forma consolidated selected statement of operations data presents our results of operations for the three years ended december   excluding amortization of intangibles  write off of in process research and development and acquisition related expenses  employer taxes on stock option exercises  non recurring charges  and net losses realized on minority investments 
we believe the exclusion of these items provides a more relevant summary of the results of our operations as they relate to our core business and we use these measures internally to evaluate our operating performance 
this information is not to be construed as a measurement of profitability under generally accepted accounting principles and is not to be accepted or used as an alternative to net income 
additionally  the pro forma results of operations  as presented  may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
all acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method are included in the following summary from the date those entities were acquired 
as discussed in note business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the acquisitions of supplybase and aspect were completed in the second quarter of and  accordingly  the operating results of supplybase and aspect are included with our results of operations since their respective dates of acquisition of april  and june  amounts shown are in thousands  except per share data 
year ended december  pro forma unaudited selected statement of operations data revenues    costs and expenses    operating income    other income  net    income before income taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share weighted average common shares outstanding    weighted average diluted common shares outstanding    the above pro forma amounts have been adjusted to exclude the following items amortization of intangibles  in process research and development and acquisition related expenses    employer taxes on stock option exercises   non cash settlement  net losses realized on minority investments  income tax effect of excluded items  net effect of pro forma adjustments    liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash flows provided from operations  long term borrowings and sales of equity securities 
our liquidity and financial position at december  showed a increase in working capital in working capital was million as of year end and million as of year end the increase in working capital is primarily attributed to million in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net change in cash and cash equivalents was also positively impacted by the net effect of cash provided by proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees and exercise of stock options  offset by cash used in investing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased  net cash used in investing activities decreased and net cash provided by financing activities decreased over totals 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million  or  over balances at december  the increase was the result of million in cash generated by operating activities and million in cash provided by financing activities  offset by million in cash used in investing activities 
the most significant transactions which adjusted net income to net cash provided by operations for were write offs of in process research and development of million  depreciation and amortization of billion  deferred income taxes and disqualifying dispositions of million  tax benefits from stock option exercises of million and the net increase in accounts receivable of million 
significant items that affected our net cash used in investing activities in were purchases of premises and equipment of million  cash acquired in purchase transactions of million  direct costs of purchase transactions of million  and net maturities and sales of debt securities and equity investments of million 
the million in cash provided by financing activities was from proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees and exercises of stock options 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  increased in days sales outstanding dso s in receivables decreased to days as of december  from days as of december  the increase in accounts receivable was due to a increase in total revenue 
dso s decreased due to strong collection efforts in that resulted in over billion in actual cash collections 
there is no assurance that dso performance will remain at this level 
we maintain two  one year revolving lines of credit of million with separate financial institutions that have an aggregate borrowing capacity of million 
there have been no borrowings under these agreements  which are renewable in august see note borrowings in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
on december   we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of our convertible subordinated notes due in as of year end  none of the notes have been converted to common stock 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share at any time prior to maturity 
on or after december   we have the option to redeem  in cash  all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously converted 
see note borrowings in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in the future  we may pursue acquisition of businesses  products and technologies  or enter into joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand our business 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the nature  timing and amount of consideration to be paid 
we expect future liquidity will be enhanced to the extent that we are able to realize the cash benefit from utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards against future tax liabilities 
as of december   we had million in net operating loss carryforwards  which represent up to million in future tax benefits 
the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations and various expiration dates in years through we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investment balances  available borrowings under the revolving credit agreements and our anticipated cash flows from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies or joint venture arrangements could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
sensitivity to market risks foreign currency risk 
revenues originating outside of the united states totaled  and of total revenues in  and revenues from our european markets totaled  and of total revenues for the same years 
due to the fact that we conduct business on a global basis in various foreign currencies  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
during  and  our strategy for managing foreign currency risk was limited to hedging certain significant accounts receivable that were denominated in a foreign currency 
gains and losses realized from hedging activities through december  have not been significant 
in january  we established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge various nonfunctional currency exposures 
we expect this program to reduce the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations because foreign currency transaction gains and losses recorded for accounting purposes will be offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts 
the forward contracts we enter into will generally have original maturities of one month 
we have not used  nor do we expect to use  forward contracts for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds and taxable and tax exempt variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities and local  state and national governmental entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term time deposits of the local operating bank 
due to the demand nature of our money market funds and the short term nature of our time deposits and debt securities portfolio  these assets are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of december   of our debt securities and time deposits had original maturities of three months or less  while had original maturities between three months and one year 
if these short term assets are reinvested in a declining interest rate environment  we would experience an immediate negative impact on other income 
the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment 
the federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest 
since december   the federal reserve board has decreased the discount rate by basis points  which has led to a general decline in market interest rates 
assuming the federal reserve board maintains this position on interest rates  we expect our average yield on investments to decline in provided the composition of our investment portfolio remains the same 
the weighted average yield on interest earning investments held as of december  was compared to for investments held as of december  based on our investment holdings as of december   an immediate basis point decline in the average yield earned on these investments would reduce our expected annual interest earnings by million 
market price risk 
in addition to investments in debt securities  we maintain minority equity investments in various privately held and publicly traded companies for business and strategic purposes 
our investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility 
as a result of market price volatility  we experienced a million net after tax unrealized loss during on these investments 
our ability to sell certain equity positions is restricted because the shares held may not have been registered or other contractual agreements 
while these positions were not hedged as of december   in  we may implement hedging strategies using put and call options to fix our gains and limit our losses in certain equity positions until such time as the investments can be sold 
the fair value of our investments in publicly traded companies totaled million at december  the fair value of these investments would be million given decreases in each stock s price 
we have invested in numerous privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
further  market conditions for these types of investments have been deteriorating of late 
we could lose our entire investments in these companies 
as of december   our investments in privately held companies totaled million 
in  realized losses related to the write down of various equity investments totaled million  or of year end holdings 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and sfas sfas requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value 
unless designated as hedges  changes in these fair values will be recorded in the income statement 
fair value changes involving hedges will generally be recorded by offsetting gains and losses on the hedge and on the hedged item  even if the fair value of the hedged item is not otherwise recorded 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  they could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or we may fail to meet expectations  which would negatively impact the price of our stock 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past  and we expect our operating results to continue to vary from quarter to quarter in the future  due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
factors that could affect quarterly operating results include volume and timing of customer orders 
length of the sales cycle 
customer budget constraints 
announcement or introduction of new products or product enhancements by our competitors or us 
changes in prices of our products and those of our competitors 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
market acceptance of new products 
mix of direct and indirect sales 
changes in our strategic relationships 
changes in our business strategy 
economic conditions 
technological changes 
we will continue to determine our investment and expense levels based on expected future revenues 
significant portions of our expenses are not variable in the short term  and we cannot reduce them quickly to respond to decreases in revenues 
therefore  if revenues are below expectations  this shortfall is likely to adversely and disproportionately affect our operating results 
in addition  we may reduce our prices or accelerate investment in research and development efforts in response to competitive pressures or to pursue new market opportunities 
any of these activities may further limit our ability to adjust spending in response to revenue fluctuations 
revenues may not grow at historical rates in future periods  or they may not grow at all 
accordingly  we may not maintain positive operating margins in future quarters 
in addition  with our rapid growth  we have set a number of demanding objectives and commitments that may cause challenges to our operations 
any of these factors could cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers may cause us to fail to meet expectations  which would negatively impact the price of our stock 
our operating results can vary significantly based upon the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers 
more specifically  the macro economic environment entering is more uncertain than in recent periods and has the potential to materially and adversely affect us 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the areas in which we compete 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers whose businesses fluctuate with general economic and business conditions  a softening of demand for computer software caused by a weakening economy may result in decreased revenues and lower growth rates 
we may be especially prone to this as a result of the relatively large license transactions we have historically relied upon 
customers may defer or reconsider purchasing products if they experience a downturn in their business or if there is a downturn in the general economy 
we anticipate seasonal fluctuations in revenues  which may cause volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past  and the market price of our common stock may be volatile in the future 
historically  our revenues have tended to be strongest in the fourth quarter of the year 
we believe that our seasonality is due to the calendar year budgeting cycles of many of our customers and our compensation policy that rewards sales personnel for achieving annual revenue quotas 
in future periods  these seasonal trends may cause our quarter to quarter operating results to vary  which may result in failing to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors in any period 
historically  a small number of individual license sales have been significant in each quarterly period 
therefore  our operating results for a given period could suffer serious harm if we fail to close one or more large sales expected for that period 
we generally derive a significant portion of revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large license sales with  in some cases  long and intensive sales cycles 
moreover  due to customer purchasing patterns  we typically realize a significant portion of our software license revenues in the last few weeks of a quarter 
as a result  we are subject to significant variations in license revenues and results of operations if we incur any delays in customer purchases 
if in any future period we fail to close one or more substantial license sales that we have targeted to close in that period  this failure could seriously harm our operating results for that period 
implementation of our products is complex  time consuming and expensive and customers may be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products 
our products must integrate with the many existing computer systems and software programs of our customers 
this can be complex  time consuming and expensive  and may cause delays in the deployment of our products 
our customers may be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products 
we may not remain competitive  and increased competition could seriously harm our business 
our competitors offer a variety of e business solutions including enterprise software 
we segment our competition into several main categories  including large erp software vendors  including oracle and sap  who have added or are attempting to add capabilities for supply chain planning or business to business collaboration to their transaction system products 
companies such as adexa  manugistics and others that compete principally with our supply chain management applications 
companies such as agile  commerce one and others that compete principally with our supplier relationship management applications 
companies such as trilogy and others that compete principally with our customer relationship management applications 
companies such as rti  saqqara and others that compete principally with our content and content management applications 
other vendors who establish electronic marketplaces and indirect procurement capabilities that may compete now or in the future with marketplaces created or powered by us 
other business application software vendors that may offer or partner with independent developers of advanced planning and scheduling software 
internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments 
relative to us  our competitors may have one or more of the following advantages longer operating history 
greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources 
superior product functionality in specific areas 
greater name recognition 
a broader range of products to offer 
a larger installed base of customers 
current and potential competitors have established  or may establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products  which may result in increased competition 
in addition  we expect to experience increasing price competition as we compete for market share  and we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors 
any of these conditions could cause substantial harm to our business  operating results and financial condition 
our objective of increasing our recurring revenue streams by selling marketplace services and content to marketplaces and their participants is unproven and may be unsuccessful 
as part of our business strategy  we are offering electronic marketplace services and content to trading communities and participants in digital marketplaces 
we are currently providing only a limited portion of our intended i tradematrix solutions in only a relatively small number of digital trading communities compared to the potential market for digital trading communities 
we cannot be certain that these trading communities will be operated effectively  that enterprises will join and remain in these trading communities  or that we will develop and provide successfully all intended i tradematrix solutions 
if this business strategy is flawed  or if we are unable to execute it effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition could be substantially harmed 
we depend on our strategic partners and other third parties 
if we fail to derive benefits from our existing and future strategic relationships  our business will suffer 
from time to time  we have collaborated with other companies  including ibm and pricewaterhousecoopers  in areas such as marketing  distribution and implementation 
maintaining these and other relationships is a meaningful part of our business strategy 
however  some of our current and potential strategic partners are either actual or potential competitors  which may impair the viability of these relationships 
in addition  some of our relationships have failed to meet expectations and may fail to meet expectations in the future 
we may not be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future and our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
any decrease in demand for our enterprise products and services could significantly reduce our revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from licenses of our enterprise products and related services 
our enterprise products principally include solutions for supply chain management  supplier relationship management  customer relationship management and other planning products 
we expect license revenues and maintenance and consulting contracts related to these products to continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results will depend upon continued market acceptance of these applications 
however  our enterprise applications may not achieve continued market acceptance 
competition  technological change or other factors could decrease demand for  or market acceptance of these applications 
any decrease in demand or market acceptance of our enterprise offering could substantially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are investing significant resources in developing and marketing our marketplace solutions 
the market for these solutions is new and evolving  and  if this market does not develop as we anticipate  or  if we are unable to develop acceptable solutions  serious harm would result to our business 
we are investing significant resources in further developing and marketing enhanced products and services to facilitate conducting business on line  within an enterprise and among many enterprises  including public and private marketplaces 
for the first few months after we introduce new products and services  the demand for  and market acceptance of  those products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty  especially where acquisition of our products or services requires a large capital commitment or other significant commitment of resources 
adoption of e business software solutions  particularly by those individuals and enterprises that have historically relied upon traditional means of commerce and communication  will require a broad acceptance of new and substantially different methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
these products and services are often complex and involve a new approach to the conduct of business  and  as a result  intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of these products and services in order to generate demand 
the market for this broader functionality may not develop  competitors may develop superior products and services  or we may not develop acceptable solutions to address this functionality 
any one of these events could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our i tradematrix solutions are hosted by a variety of third parties and customers may experience performance problems or delays as a result of service interruptions 
our i tradematrix platform may be hosted by i or other companies 
dissatisfaction or problems with our services or the services of the third parties that host our i tradematrix solutions or delays or interruptions or other problems with service due to mechanical failure  human error  security breaches  power loss and other facility failures  natural disaster  sabotage  vandalism  or other similar events could result in a reduction of business generated by the marketplaces 
in addition  failure of any telecommunications providers to provide consistent data communications capacity could result in interruptions in services 
each of these service providers could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our products  services and systems 
dissatisfaction with hosting providers could adversely affect our relationship with our customers resulting in a loss of future sales of licenses and services to the customer  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we publish inaccurate catalog content data  our business could suffer 
the accurate publication of catalog content is critical to our customers businesses 
our i tradematrix suite of products offers content management tools that help suppliers manage the collection and publication of catalog content 
any defects or errors in these tools or the failure of these tools to accurately publish catalog content could deter businesses from participating in the i tradematrix marketplaces  damage our business reputation and harm our ability to win new customers 
in addition  from time to time some of our customers may submit inaccurate pricing or other inaccurate catalog information 
even though such inaccuracies are not caused by our work and are not within our control  such inaccuracies could deter current and potential customers from using our products and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the markets in which we compete experience rapid technological change 
if we do not respond to the technological advances of the marketplace  we could seriously harm our business 
enterprises are increasing their focus on decision support solutions for e business challenges 
as a result  they are requiring their application software vendors to provide greater levels of functionality and broader product offerings 
moreover  competitors continue to make rapid technological advances in computer hardware and software technology and frequently introduce new products  services and enhancements 
we must continue to enhance our current product line and develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with the technological developments of our competitors 
we must also satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
if we cannot successfully respond to the technological advances of others  or if our new products or product enhancements and services do not achieve market acceptance  these events could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
if use of the internet for commerce and communication does not increase as we anticipate  our business will suffer 
we are offering new and enhanced products and services  which depend on increased acceptance and use of the internet as a medium for commerce and communication 
rapid growth in the use of the internet is a recent phenomenon 
as a result  acceptance and use may not continue to develop at historical rates  and a sufficiently broad base of business customers may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of commerce 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty  and there exist a limited number of proven services and products 
our business could be seriously harmed  among other things  if use of the internet and other online services does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected 
the necessary communication and computer network technology underlying the internet and other online services does not effectively support any expansion that may occur 
new standards and protocols are not developed or adopted in a timely manner 
the internet does not create a viable commercial marketplace  inhibiting the development of electronic commerce and reducing the need for and desirability of our products and services due to concerns about security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service or other reasons 
future regulation of the internet may slow its growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business 
due to increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that state  federal and international regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
for example  the growth and development of the market for internet based services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership  sales tax  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
any new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could inhibit the expansion of the internet  causing our costs to increase and our growth to be harmed 
concerns that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of consumers could inhibit sales of our products 
one of the features of our customer management software applications is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of consumers for use by businesses 
typically  these products capture profile information when consumers  business customers and employees visit an internet web site and volunteer information in response to survey questions concerning their backgrounds  interests and preferences 
our products augment these profiles over time by collecting usage data 
although our customer management products are designed to operate with applications that protect user privacy  privacy concerns may nevertheless cause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this profiling capability 
if we cannot adequately address consumers privacy concerns  these concerns could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
if our encryption technology fails to ensure the security of our customers online transactions  serious harm to our business could result 
the secure exchange of value and confidential information over public networks is a significant concern of consumers engaging in online transactions and interaction 
our customer management software applications use encryption technology to provide the security necessary to effect the secure exchange of value and confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that these applications use to protect customer transaction data 
if any compromise or breach were to occur  it could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
rapid growth in our operations could increase demands on our managerial and operational resources 
if rapid growth in the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers continues  it may increase demands on our management and operations 
our officers and other key employees will need to implement and improve our operational  customer support and financial control systems and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
further  we expect we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
we may not be able to manage future expansion successfully  and our inability to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions 
in april  we acquired supplybase and in june  we acquired aspect 
in addition  we have acquired other businesses and products to help broaden and strengthen our product portfolio 
continued success of acquisitions will depend primarily on our ability to retain  motivate and integrate the acquired personnel 
integrate multiple information systems 
integrate acquired products and services with our existing products and services 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating our operations and products with companies we acquire and we may not realize the benefits that we anticipated when we make acquisitions 
our failure to successfully integrate our operations and products with companies we acquire could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may make future acquisitions or enter into joint ventures that may not be successful 
in the future  we may acquire additional businesses  products and technologies  or enter into joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand our business 
management s negotiations of potential acquisitions or joint ventures and management s integration of acquired businesses  products or technologies could divert their time and resources 
future acquisitions could cause us to issue dilutive equity securities  incur debt or contingent liabilities  amortize goodwill and other intangibles  or write off in process research and development and other acquisition related expenses that could seriously harm our financial condition and operating results 
further  we may not be able to properly integrate acquired businesses  products or technology with our existing operations or train  retain and motivate personnel from the acquired business 
if we are unable to fully integrate an acquired business  product or technology or train  retain and motivate personnel from the acquired business  we may not receive the intended benefits of that acquisition 
we face risks associated with international sales and operations that could harm our company 
our international operations are subject to risks inherent in international business activities 
in addition  we may expand our international operations in the future  which would increase our exposure to these risks 
the risks we face internationally include difficulties and costs of staffing and managing geographically disparate operations 
longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries 
compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
overlap of different tax structures 
greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property 
meeting import and export licensing requirements 
trade restrictions 
changes in tariff rates 
political instability 
changes in economic conditions in international markets 
changes in the value of the us dollar  as compared to the currencies of foreign countries where we transact business  could harm our operating results 
to date  our international revenues have been denominated primarily in us dollars 
the majority of our international expenses and some revenues have been denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
therefore  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 
as our international operations expand  we will use an increasing number of foreign currencies  causing our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations to increase 
although we have implemented hedging programs to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations  currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused  and will continue to cause  currency transaction gains and losses 
while these transactional gains and losses have not been material to date  they may harm our business  results of operations or financial condition in the future 
the loss of any of our key personnel or our failure to attract additional personnel could seriously harm our company 
we rely upon the continued service of a relatively small number of key technical and senior management personnel 
our future success depends on retaining our key employees and our continuing ability to attract  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
relatively few of our key technical or senior management personnel are bound by employment agreements 
as a result  our employees could leave with little or no prior notice 
we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
our loss of any of our key technical and senior management personnel or our inability to attract  train and retain additional qualified personnel could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we could lose our intellectual property rights or be liable for significant damages 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
in addition  we generally license enterprise products to end users in object code machine readable format  and our license agreements generally allow the use of enterprise products solely by the customer for internal purposes without the right to sublicense or transfer the enterprise products 
however  these measures afford only limited protection 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
software piracy may be a problem 
we are not able to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
this is particularly true in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and may not provide us with an effective remedy against piracy 
as the number of products and competitors continues to grow  the functionality of products in different industry segments is increasingly overlapping 
as a result  we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or damages  cause product shipment delays or the loss or deferral of sales  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
if we enter into royalty or licensing agreements in settlement of any litigation or claims  these agreements may not be on terms acceptable to us 
unfavorable royalty and licensing agreements could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we resell some software that we license from third parties 
although we may continue this practice  third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or as a result of infringement claims 
our inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses will delay or reduce our product shipments until we can identify  license and integrate equivalent software 
any loss of these licenses or delay or reduction in product shipments could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products failure to remain compatible with existing and new computers and software operating systems would seriously harm our business 
our i tradematrix software can operate on a variety of hardware platforms including digital equipment compaq  hewlett packard  ibm and sun microsystems  and operating systems from sun microsystems and microsoft 
i tradematrix can access data from most widely used structured query language databases  including informix  oracle and sybase 
if additional hardware or software platforms gain significant market acceptance  we may be required to attempt to adapt i tradematrix to those platforms in order to remain competitive 
however  those platforms may not be architecturally compatible with i tradematrix software product design  and we may not be able to adapt i tradematrix to those additional platforms on a timely basis  or at all 
any failure to maintain compatibility with existing platforms or to adapt to new platforms that achieve significant market acceptance would seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our software is complex and may contain undetected errors 
our software programs are complex and may contain undetected errors or bugs 
although we conduct extensive testing  we may not discover bugs until our customers install and use a given product or until the volume of services that a product provides increases 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products because of bugs 
undetected errors could result in loss of customers or reputation  adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased insurance costs or claims against us by customers  any of which could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
releases of and problems with new products may cause purchasing delays  which would harm our revenues 
customers may delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation of our new or enhanced products  or products of competitors 
delays in customer purchasing decisions could seriously harm our business and operating results 
moreover  significant delays in the general availability of new releases  significant problems in the installation or implementation of new releases  or customer dissatisfaction with new releases could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our failure to successfully recruit and retain technical and implementation personnel could reduce our license revenues or limit the growth of our license revenues 
a shortage of qualified technical sales support personnel could harm our ability to expand sales and enter into new vertical markets 
we depend on our trained implementation personnel or those of independent consultants to implement our products and services 
a shortage in the number of trained implementation personnel could limit our ability to implement our software and services on a timely and effective basis 
delayed or ineffective implementation of our software and services may limit our ability to expand our revenues and may result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation 
any of these events could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become subject to product liability claims 
our license agreements typically seek to limit our exposure to product liability claims from our customers 
however  these contract provisions may not preclude all potential claims 
additionally  our general liability insurance may be inadequate to protect us from all liability that we may face 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
as a result  any claim  whether or not successful  could harm our reputation and business  operating results and financial condition 
our executive officers and directors have significant influence over stockholder votes 
on march   our executive officers and directors together beneficially owned approximately of the total voting power of our company 
accordingly  these stockholders have significant influence in determining the composition of our board of directors and will continue to have significant influence over our affairs 
our charter and bylaws have anti takeover provisions 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws as well as delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
the combination of these provisions may inhibit a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
our stock price historically has been volatile  which may make it more difficult for you to resell common stock when you want at prices you find attractive 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past  and may continue to be volatile in the future 
the following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock quarterly variations in our results of operations 
announcement of new products  product enhancements  joint ventures and other alliances by our competitors or us 
technological innovations by our competitors or us 
general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
in particular  the stock prices of many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have fluctuated widely  often due to events unrelated to their operating performance 
these fluctuations may harm the market price of our common stock
