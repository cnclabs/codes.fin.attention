item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by ourselves and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of orders which are difficult to forecast 
because our customers generally order on an as needed basis  and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  we don t have an order backlog which can assist us in forecasting results 
for all these reasons  our results of operations for any quarter are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter 
a large portion of our quarterly revenue is usually generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
since our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts  if revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter do not meet our forecast  operating results can be very negatively affected 
we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years 
see note of notes to financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from sonic solutions statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal years through years ended march  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other expense provision benefit for income taxes net loss comparison of fiscal years ended march   and net revenue 
our net revenue decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal to  in fiscal  representing a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal and a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal the decreases in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to decreases in sales of our professional audio and dvd systems which were partially offset by increases in sales of our consumer dvd products  including dvdit 
the decreases were also partially offset by sales of daikin related products 
see earlier discussion regarding the acquisition of the dvd software development business of daikin industries  ltd 
international sales accounted for  of our net revenue in each of the fiscal years   and see note of notes to financial statements 
international sales have historically represented around of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant percentage of future revenue 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue decreased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal the decreases in cost of revenue in fiscal year and fiscal year were primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin consumer dvd systems and to the reduction of hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional dvd systems 
marketing and sales 
our marketing and sales expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal marketing and sales represented  and of net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
our marketing and sales expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to increases in salary expenses as a result of an increase in headcount  and increases in advertising and marketing costs related to our dvd product lines 
our marketing and sales expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower commission expenses 
our marketing and sales headcount increased from thirty seven at march  to forty at march  to forty nine at march  dealer and employee commission expenses  as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in fiscal and fiscal to and fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal our research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue were in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded on our balance sheet is then amortized over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
our research and development expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to increased headcount from thirty at march  to thirty two at march  and due to consulting expenses associated with introductions of new products  including our dvdit product 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal due to reduced consulting expenses associated with new product development 
headcount remained consistent at thirty two from march  to march  consulting expenses can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the status of software development projects and our schedule of new product introductions 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal to  in fiscal these expenses represented of net revenue in fiscal  of net revenue in fiscal and of net revenue in fiscal our general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to a charge to bad debt expense of  which represented an additional reserve for sales to audio professionals and distributors who are experiencing liquidity difficulties due to a decline in their business 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in legal and professional expenses 
other income and expense 
other expense on our statement of operations includes primarily the net amount of interest or other financing charges we have incurred due to borrowings 
for our  and fiscal years  we incurred interest and other financing charges related to financing agreements we had with entities associated with hambrecht quist  as well as borrowings under our bank credit line 
other income includes the interest we earned on cash balances and short term investments 
provision for income taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we made no provision for income taxes for our and years 
for the fiscal year a benefit was recorded during the quarter ended june  to reflect the refund due us following the conclusion of an internal revenue service audit 
during the fiscal year we exhausted our ability to carryback tax losses resulting from operations in the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources 
in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank 
the loan agreement  which we sometimes refer to as our bank credit line  has been modified or renewed at various times since december our bank credit line expired on march  in march   we renegotiated a previous financing arrangement with hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
the agreement we reached involved the restructuring of  debt into  of series c convertible preferred stock see note of notes to financial statements and  of debt 
the interest rate on such restructured debt was and was due in october we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the resale of the  shares of the company s common stock which underlie the series c convertible preferred stock issued to hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
in connection with the agreement  the exercise price of  of the warrants issued with the original arrangement reached in december was lowered to the fair value of common stock of 
we accounted for this transaction by revaluing the new warrants  using comparable assumptions as the original warrant grant  and the resultant value of  was amortized over the new loan period 
in june    of the warrants were exercised on a net exercise basis  and the warrant holder received  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march    and  shares of the preferred stock were converted into common stock pursuant to this financing arrangement 
in october   we renegotiated a financing arrangement with hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
the agreement we reached involved the restructuring of  debt into  shares of series c convertible preferred stock and  of debt 
the interest rate on the restructured debt is and the debt and interest were payable in monthly installments through april  in connection with this agreement  we issued warrants to purchase  common shares at an exercise price of 
these warrants expire on april  we also enhanced the conversion rate of hambrecht and quist s existing series c convertible preferred stock so that each share of series c convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock 
the beneficial conversion feature  warrants and new debt were recorded at their relative fair values 
we recorded  of deferred financing costs attributable to this finance restructuring with hambrecht quist guaranty 
this amount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the term of the financing facility months 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions volatility of  risk free interest rate of and expected life equal to the contractual terms 
we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the shares of the common stock which underlie the series c convertible preferred stock and the  shares of our common stock which underlie the warrants issued to hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
in december   we secured a  equity based line of credit 
under this arrangement  we had the right to draw up to a total of  in cash in exchange for common stock 
pricing of the common stock issued was based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw subject to a discount and a commission payable in common stock 
the availability of the credit line  and the amounts and timing of draws under the line were subject to a number of conditions 
in january   we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the resale of shares issued under this credit line 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew  from this credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew an additional  from this credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
this facility is no longer available to us 
on may   we secured a new equity based line of credit by entering into a new stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge 
under this arrangement  we were able to draw up to  in cash in exchange for common stock 
pricing of the common stock issued under this arrangement was based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw  discounted by or  depending upon the price of our common stock 
the availability of the credit line  and the amounts and timing of draws under the line were subject to a number of conditions 
on may   we filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the shares we may issue to kingsbridge under this credit line and on august  the statement became effective 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew  from the credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
because of limitations on the total number of shares that could be issued under this line of credit  this facility is no longer available to us and was terminated on march  on may   we secured a new equity based line of credit by entering into a new stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge 
under the new agreement  we may draw up to  in cash in exchange for common stock 
pricing of the common stock issued under this agreement is based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw subject to discounts ranging from to 
the availability of the credit line  and the amounts and timing of draws under the lines are subject to a number of conditions  including a listing on nasdaq 
on july   we filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the shares we may issue to kingsbridge under this credit line and on november  the statement became effective 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew  from the credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
our operating activities have used cash of  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year during those fiscal years cash required by operating activities was not as great as our operating losses due to the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in addition to our operations  we utilized cash during the   and fiscal years primarily to purchase new fixed assets  pay down debt obligations and to develop and purchase software that was added to capitalized software 
during the  and fiscal years we augmented cash on hand primarily by drawing on the equity credit lines described above 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available credit and cash generated from operations  plus cash available through the new equity based line of credit with kingsbridge will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal year as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below we have had losses in each of the past five years 
we were unprofitable during each of the last five fiscal years 
for example  in fiscal year  we had a net loss of  and in fiscal year we had a net loss of  we were unprofitable during the first three quarters of the fiscal year and during each quarter of the and fiscal years 
we may not be profitable at any time in the future 
our lack of profitability could cause our share price to decline 
the other risks identified below could also cause the value of our shares to decline 
we cannot  however  estimate the likelihood that our shares will decline in value or the amount by which they may decline 
during the last three years we had negative operating cash flows and expect this to continue 
we might need additional financing in order to continue to operate 
during the last three fiscal years we had a negative operating cash flow of   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
this means that without access to outside capital we would have had to cease or significantly curtail operations 
we believe that we may continue to run a negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future  and might continue to need to obtain additional financing to continue to operate 
if we are unable to obtain such financing  then we may have to cease or significantly curtail operations 
our stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge capital limited may be unavailable or insufficient to meet our future cash needs 
in may  we entered into an agreement with kingsbridge capital limited which allows us to sell from time to time up to  of common stock to kingsbridge 
in no event  however  can we sell any shares in an amount in excess of of our outstanding common stock 
as of may   we had sold under this agreement approximately  shares of common stock with gross proceeds to us of approximately  assuming our stock price remains at per share  the maximum number of shares we could sell in the future to kingsbridge under this agreement would be approximately  shares with gross proceeds of approximately  our ability to sell stock to kingsbridge  however  is subject to a number of terms and conditions  including  for example  continued listing of our stock on nasdaq  continued effectiveness of a registration statement  continued accuracy of representations and warranties made to kingsbridge and lack of material adverse changes to our business 
the risk to us is that  because of these and other conditions  at the time we need cash in the future  the stock sale arrangement with kingsbridge may be unavailable or insufficient to meet our cash needs 
if the stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge is unavailable or insufficient to meet our needs when we need working capital  we may have to cease or significantly curtail operations 
any failure to successfully integrate the daikin business we acquired on february  could negatively impact us 
in february  we acquired the dvd business and assets of daikin 
this acquisition involves risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
these risks include  among others 
distracting management from day to day operations of our business  
costs  delays and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations  products and personnel  
incurring amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  
the potential dilution resulting from conversion of the preferred stock issued to daikin  
undiscovered and unknown problems  defects or other issues related to the daikin products that become known to us only some time after consummation of the acquisition  
negative reactions from our current resellers  or our current customers  to the acquisition  and 
negative reactions from the current resellers or the current customers of the daikin business to the acquisition of that business by us 
if new digital formats are unsuccessful  it is unlikely that we will generate sufficient revenues to recover our development cost 
our business involves new digital audio and video formats  such as dvd video and dvd audio  and  more recently  the new recordable dvd formats including dvd ram  dvd r rw and dvd rw 
if these formats prove to be unsuccessful or are not accepted for any reason  there will be only limited demand for our products 
we may have to incur significant product redesign costs if chip manufacturers discontinue or redesign their products 
our products are based on integrated circuits or chips produced by other companies 
if these chip manufacturers discontinue or redesign the chips we use for our products  then we will likely incur significant costs to redesign our products to handle these changes 
we cannot estimate the amount of these costs or the likelihood that we will have to redesign our products 
our reliance on outsourcing and single suppliers for our manufacturing and components makes us vulnerable to supplier operational problems 
our outsourcing manufacturing program commits responsibility for almost all of our manufacturing activities to a single supplier 
in addition  we often use components that are only available from a single source 
reliance on a single supplier for manufacturing or for certain manufacturing components makes us vulnerable to operating or financial problems encountered by those suppliers 
if we fail to protect our products intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  we may not be able to market our products successfully 
our products are based in large part on proprietary technology 
to the extent that we use patents to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain needed patents or  if granted  the patents may be held invalid or otherwise indefensible 
in addition  we make extensive use of trade secrets that we may not be able to protect 
to the extent we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  competitors may enter the market offering products identical to ours  with a negative impact on sales of our products 
other companies intellectual property rights may prevent our current or future product development and sales 
we have never conducted a comprehensive patent search relating to the technology we use in our products 
there may be issued or pending patents owned by third parties that relate to our products 
if so  we could incur substantial costs defending against patent infringement claims or we could even be blocked from selling our products 
other companies may succeed in obtaining valid patents covering one or more of the key techniques we utilize in our products 
if so  we may be forced to obtain required licenses or implement alternative non infringing approaches 
our products are designed to adhere to industry standards  such as dvd rom  dvd video  dvd audio and mpeg video 
a number of companies and organizations hold various patents that claim to cover various aspects of dvd and mpeg technology 
we have entered into license agreements with certain companies relative to some of these technologies 
for instance  we have entered into license agreements with dolby licensing corporation covering dolby digital audio and with meridian audio limited covering meridian lossless packing 
such license agreements may not be sufficient to grant all of the intellectual property rights to us necessary to market our products 
regarding claims for patent infringement  some of the purchase and license agreements we have with our customers allocate responsibility to our customers for satisfying any such claims  while some of our customer purchase and license agreements allocate such responsibility to us 
regardless of the provisions of our customer purchase and license agreements  third parties could pursue us claiming that our products infringe various patents 
patent infringement litigation could be time consuming and costly 
if the litigation resulted in an unfavorable outcome for us  we could be subject to substantial damage claims and a requirement that we obtain a royalty or license agreement to continue using the technology in issue 
such royalty or license agreements might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  resulting in serious harm to our business 
in this regard a group of companies have formed an organization called mpeg la to enforce the rights of holders of patents covering aspects of mpeg video technology 
we have been asked by mpeg la to enter into a license agreement with them 
we have not entered into such an agreement with mpeg la  though we are continuing to evaluate the situation 
the cost to us of such a license cannot be estimated at this time 
because a majority of our products operate only on macintosh computers  the potential success of our products is tied to the success of this platform 
many of our current products operate on macintosh computers manufactured by apple computer 
if macintosh computers become in short supply  sales of our products will likely decline 
if there is a decrease in the use of the macintosh as a computing platform in the professional and corporate audio and video markets  there will likely be a decrease in demand for our products 
if there are changes in the operating system or architecture of the macintosh  it is likely that we will incur significant costs to adapt our products to the changes 
in april  apple computer announced the acquisition of the dvd authoring business of astarte gmbh 
prior to the acquisition  astarte sold a dvd authoring system that competed primarily with our dvd fusion product 
in january apple announced two new dvd authoring products  which we presume are based on astarte s technology 
the first product  idvd  is intended for consumer users and we believe will compete with mydvd and dvdit 
the second product  dvd studio pro  is intended for professional users  and we believe will compete with dvdit pe  dvd fusion and reeldvd 
apple also announced the availability of aggressively priced dvd recorders with certain models of the macintosh personal computer 
at this time the impact of apple s announcements on our business is unclear  and it is possible that some or all of apple s product offerings will significantly reduce demand for our products 
some of our competitors possess greater technological and financial resources than we do 
there is a substantial risk that competing companies will produce better or more cost effective products  or will be better equipped than we are to promote them in the marketplace 
please see our discussion concerning apple computer  above 
other competitors who have announced or are delivering products which compete with our products include mgi  pinnacle  roxio  spruce technologies and ulead 
in addition  other companies with greater financial and technological resources may be interested in entering the growing consumer business for dvd 
we have little ability to reduce expenses to compensate for reduced sales 
we tend to close the greatest number of sales in the last month or last weeks of a quarter and we generally do not know until quite late in a quarter whether our sales expectations for the quarter will be met 
because most of our quarterly operating expenses and our inventory purchasing is committed prior to quarter end  we have little ability to reduce expenses to compensate for reduced sales 
for example  in the fiscal quarter ending december   we experienced a significant slowdown of demand for our professional dvd products in the last month of that quarter  particularly in the north american and japanese markets 
although we attempted to control expenses in the face of this slowdown  the changes we were able to make were quite small  leading to a significant operating loss for the quarter 
approximately of our revenue derives from sales to a single company and another was derived from sales to a large distributor 
during the last three fiscal years   and  between and  of our revenue was derived from sales of audio processing subsystems to discreet logic 
during the fiscal years and  an additional and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from sales to our japanese dealer  sanshin electronics company 
a decrease or interruption in either discreet logic s or sanshin s business or their demand for our products would cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
a significant portion of our revenue derives from sales made to foreign customers located primarily in europe and japan 
revenue derived from these customers accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal year and these foreign customers expose us to the following risks  among others 
currency movements in which the us dollar becomes significantly stronger with respect to foreign currencies  thereby reducing relative demand for our products outside the united states  
import and export restrictions and duties  
foreign regulatory restrictions  for example  safety or radio emissions regulations  and 
liquidity problems in various foreign markets 
the issuance of stock pursuant to the daikin acquisition agreements will dilute the relative ownership of existing common stockholders and could result in lower market price for our stock 
the issuance of  shares of common stock to daikin  the issuance of  shares of common stock to digitek and the issuance of up to  shares of common stock to daikin upon conversion of preferred stock now or in the future  will have a dilutive impact on our security holders 
for example  based upon the number of shares of common stock outstanding on april   conversion of  shares of preferred stock into common stock would dilute our shareholders by 
additional sales of stock to kingsbridge will dilute the relative ownership of existing common stockholders and could result in lower market price for our stock 
under the equity line agreement with kingsbridge we have the right to sell common stock to kingsbridge in an amount up to of our outstanding common stock over the two year period beginning november  as a result  our net income or loss per share could be significantly affected in future periods causing a reduction in the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of the payments made to us by daikin pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into on february  and payments made to daikin by us pursuant to the consulting agreement entered into on february  see note of notes to financial statements
