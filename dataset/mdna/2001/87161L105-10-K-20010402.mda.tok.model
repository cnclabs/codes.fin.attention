item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues for were million compared to million reported for these annual revenues were derived from our three operating business segments of licenses and hardware  services and hosted services which represented  and of net revenues  respectively  for  and  and of net revenues  respectively  for our core product is vista  an open standards based interactive communications management icm software platform for enterprise customer call centers 
vista combines several call center technologies with a distributed client server architecture  open standard components  web based management system and a graphical application development tool 
we believe vista provides customers with flexibility  scalability and efficiency  high degrees of redundancy  and superior processing performance 
vista interactive voice response ivr  vista computer telephony integration cti  interactive web response iwr and voice recognition are currently available 
non core or legacy products include vocalpoint  an ivr platform  and vocalpoint interactive services  providing cti functionality  iwr  and premier and premier proprietary ivr systems 
in late  we began the transition of becoming a software based company from a hardware software based company 
in  we began to change the reporting of business segments to licenses and hardware  services  and hosted services from the previous structure of systems  hosted services sis  and patents 
system sales and maintenance and other services as reported in the and annual reports have been restated as licenses and hardware and services for the annual report 
licenses and hardware revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the million for the increase in was due to the strength of the vista product line which has shown increased sales in every quarter since revenues commenced in the third quarter of in  the vista product line accounted for of licenses and hardware sales 
vocalpoint systems sales declined in as the vista product line more than replaced the declining sales 
services revenues for were million compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the components of services revenues consist of patent infringement lawsuits  million decrease  maintenance revenues  million decrease but showed an upward trend in the second half of due to the increased number of installations in late and early  application services  million increase  project management  million increase  installation  million decrease  and other services  million increase 
hosted services revenues for were million compared to million for this is a decrease of million  or 
the primary reason for the decline was due to home ticket  a pay per view service for cable television providers which is offered through our sis subsidiary 
the cable tv industry has been deploying new order entry technologies for consumer purchases of pay per view events which do not utilize toll free numbers 
this has resulted in a downward trend in transaction processing fees  a trend which is expected to continue 
to offset the decline in pay per view services  hosted services has offered other outsourced electronic capabilities including dialexpress message delivery  lead capture  speech enabled directory  site locators  broadcast faxing  call center processing  and audiotext 
domestic and international sales for were million  or  and million  or  of total revenues  respectively  compared to million  or  and million  or of total revenues  respectively  for gross margin the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was of net revenues  as compared with for the year ended december  gross margins on license and hardware revenues in were million compared to million in  representing a increase in margins 
margin percentages were and of sales for and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to our ongoing transition from a hardware software based company to a software based company 
additionally  gross margin was positively affected by decreases in the inventory reserve of million and million in the years and  respectively  due to a higher than expected usage of inventory from discontinued product lines 
gross margins on services revenues in were million  or  compared to million  or in  an increase of million primarily due to the reduction in third party contractor expense 
gross margins on hosted services decreased by million from million  or  to million  or  in as compared to primarily caused by the relatively fixed nature of hosted services costs 
we include those costs directly associated with the generation of revenue in its computation of gross margin  including direct labor  application development  travel  maintenance  customer support  supplies and hardware 
gross margins will fluctuate on a year to year basis due to changes in competitive pressures  sales volume  product mix  variations in the ratio of domestic versus international sales  or changes in the mix of direct and indirect sales activity 
accordingly  the gross margins reported for are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
operating expenses operating expenses for were million  an increase of million  or  from the million reported for selling  marketing  and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in domestic sales and administration  employee incentives  desktop software  and occupancy costs related to the move of our headquarters to a new facility 
in  research and development costs decreased million  or 
the spending decreases are primarily the result of our transition from a hardware software based company to a software based company 
however  we anticipate that research and development spending will increase in future years 
operating expenses decreased due to reductions of the accounts receivable reserves by million and million in the years and  respectively 
the change in was primarily due to an increased effort and control of collections and a decrease in aged accounts receivables 
net income loss we reported a net income of million  or 
per diluted share  for  compared to a net loss of million  or 
per share for  representing a million increase over the prior year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues for remained constant at million as compared to million reported for net revenues consisted of licenses and hardware  services and hosted services  which represented  and of net revenues  respectively  for  and  and of net revenues  respectively  for licenses and hardware revenues for were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to the decline in hardware sales as we transitioned to a software based company 
services revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to an enhanced product offering with the vista product creating the need for more application development  project management and consulting services 
this increase was offset by a decline of million in maintenance revenue which was consistent with our expectations as we had earlier advised customers that certain products were not year compliant and would not be made so  causing some maintenance contracts not to be renewed 
hosted services revenues were million for  a decrease of million  or  from the million reported in the primary reason for the decline was due to our home ticket service 
the cable tv industry has been deploying new order entry technologies for consumer purchases of pay per view events which do not utilize toll free numbers 
this change resulted in a downward trend in transaction processing fees  a trend that was is expected to continue 
to offset the decline in pay per view services  hosted services has offered other outsourced electronic capabilities including dialexpress  lead capture  speech enabled directory  site locators as well as benefits enrollment  broadcast faxing  call center processing  and audiotext 
domestic and international sales for were million  or  and million  or  of total revenues  respectively  compared to million  or  and million  or of total revenues  respectively  for gross margin the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was of net revenues  as compared with for the year ended december  the gross margin on licenses and hardware remained flat at million  yet the gross margin percentage increased to for compared to for the increase in was due to the decline in hardware sales which has a lower gross margin percentage 
gross margin was positively affected by decreases in the inventory reserve of million and million in the years and  respectively  due to a higher than expected usage of inventory from discontinued product lines 
the gross margin on services for was million as compared to million in  or and  respectively 
this decline was primarily due to the increase in third party contractor expense in as we transitioned to a software based company 
gross margin on hosted services decreased by million from million  or  to million  or  in as compared to primarily caused by the relatively fixed nature of hosted services costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for were million  a decrease of million  or  from the million reported for selling  marketing  and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  primarily due to the consolidation of the corporate structure and general cost reductions which started during the second quarter of research and development costs decreased million  or 
was impacted by the development of the vista product which was released in may of operating expenses decreased due to reductions of the accounts receivable reserves of million and million in the years and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to a lower reserve coverage needed for aged account receivables at december  as compared to december  net income loss we reported a net loss of million  or 
per share  for  compared to a net loss of million  or 
per share for liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december   compared to million at december   and the current ratio was and on such dates  respectively 
cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities available for sale at the end of was million as compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities during was million 
deferred revenue increased by million due to fourth quarter payments and orders that are expected to be recognized in cash provided from investing during was million due to proceeds of million received from the sale of property and equipment from our previous headquarters location  the purchase of million in property and equipment  and million in maturities of marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities during was million primarily due to the million purchase of treasury stock and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
we use a letter of credit  secured by a  certificate of deposit  to secure the lease on our chicago facility 
accordingly  the disposal of the certificate of deposit is restricted by the letter of credit agreement 
on october   we entered into a million revolving line of credit agreement with a financial institution 
the purpose for this line of credit is to fund general operations with all of our assets as collateral 
the loan agreement contains various restrictions on us  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  and restrictions on our ability to repurchase our stock  make acquisitions  or consolidate or merge into any other entity 
in addition  the loan agreement contains certain financial covenants  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum liquidity ratio  and a maximum funded senior debt to ebitda ratio 
we violated certain restricted covenants pertaining to the line of credit agreement 
however  the financial institution waived these violations 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with future cash flows from operating activities and the line of credit will be sufficient to support our operations during on november   the board of directors approved a stock buyback plan to purchase up to million shares of our common stock over the following two years 
we completed the buyback plan during the third quarter of on november   we announced a new buyback plan pursuant to which we were authorized to acquire up to million shares over a one year period 
on august  the board of directors revised this plan by approving the buyback of an additional  shares and extending the buyback period to august  on november   the board of directors authorized an additional  share buyback with no time limitation 
as of march   we have repurchased a total of  shares under these plans since november  and are authorized to repurchase  additional shares 
operating business segments an operating business segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities which may earn revenues and incur expenses  whose results are regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision maker  and for which discrete financial information is available 
we have three operating business segments which are organized around differences in products and services licenses and hardware  services  and hosted services 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our business segments 
licenses and hardware is our operating business segment that includes our contact center software platform called vista 
vista is an all in one solution for interactive voice response  interactive web response  computer telephony interaction  fax on demand  automatic speech recognition  and other applications 
services is our operating business segment that includes customer support in the areas of consulting services  project management  application development  installation  education services  and maintenance 
we generally sell these services as part of the initial sale or in some cases as post implementation add ons 
this segment also includes patent litigation against third parties 
hosted services is our operating business segment which provides products and services including home ticket pay per view  dialexpress  lead capture  speech enabled directory  site locator  cyberstats  and a variety of out sourced electronic capabilities such as benefits enrollment and broadcast faxing which we offer through our subsidiary  sis 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
we have adopted the provisions of both sfas no 
and no 
as of january   and believe that such adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash investment portfolio 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and interest rate risk 
we place our investments in instruments with high credit quality issuers 
we classify all liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less as cash equivalents 
we classify investments with a maturity date between three and twelve months as either short term investments or marketable securities 
the average interest rate on short term investments is 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our cash investment portfolio since marketable securities have generally been held until maturity and unrealized gains and losses are negligible 
our only long term liabilities are capital lease obligations at a fixed rate 
therefore  we do not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates as it relates to our current or long term liabilities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we invoice all international customers in us dollars except for the customers of our united kingdom uk subsidiary  which are invoiced in pounds sterling 
our uk subsidiary s financials including balance sheet  revenue  and operating expenses are recorded in pounds sterling 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when we translate the financial results of that subsidiary to us dollars in consolidation 
at this time  we do not use instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure in the uk because the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations are not material for us 
additional cautionary factors that may affect future results our disclosure and analysis in this annual report contain some forward looking statements 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
you can identify such statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
these statements may include words such as anticipate  likely  expect  intend  believe  and other words and phrases of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these forward looking statements include  for example  statements relating to future actions  prospective products  future performance  results of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  and operating expenses 
from time to time  we also may provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public 
we reasonably believe that any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we make are true at the time they are made 
however  such statements may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed  and actual future results may vary materially 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to review any and all further disclosures we make on related subjects in our q and k filings with the sec and in other materials we publicly release 
also note that below is a cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business 
these are just some factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors besides those discussed below and throughout this annual report could also adversely affect us 
this discussion is provided as permitted by section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes which may cause us to incur significant development costs and prevent us from attracting new customers 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles and changing end user customer demands 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render existing products and services obsolete or unmarketable and cause us to incur significant costs to develop new or enhanced products to meet the competition of such new technologies or industry standards 
if we are unable to develop new products and services or if we are unable to develop such products fast enough to meet this competition  we could be prevented from attracting new customers and from retaining the installed base of customers we currently have 
such events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial or market performance 
our future business prospects depend in part on our ability to maintain and improve our current products and services and develop new ones 
we believe that our future business prospects depend in large part on our ability to maintain and improve our current products and services and to develop new products and services on a timely basis 
our products will have to achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of end user customer requirements 
as a result of the complexities inherent in our products  major new products and product enhancements require long development and testing periods 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or end user customer requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent a successful development  introduction or marketing of product enhancements  and our new products and product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
significant delays in the general availability of new releases of our products or significant problems in the installation or implementation of new releases of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial or market performance 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any new product or feature we introduce will receive market acceptance 
future announcements we make of new products may cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products  which could also adversely affect our business  financial or market performance 
if the technology we license from others for embedding in our products does not continue to be available  we could be forced to modify our products or eliminate product functions 
we license technology from others which we embed in some of our products 
if one or more of these licenses terminates or cannot be renewed on satisfactory terms  we could be forced to modify the affected products to use alternative technology or we may be required to eliminate the affected product function  either of which alternatives could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  should the licensors of our embedded technology cease operations or should their technology contain defects or be subject to adverse intellectual property claims  we could be adversely and materially affected 
we obtain hardware components from third parties we obtain hardware components from third parties for our products  including  without limitation  telephony interface and voice recognition boards 
we do not believe that we are dependent on a single source to supply the components we use in our product 
we are currently able to obtain key components in a timely manner from a variety of sources 
however  if we are unable to secure alternate suppliers of key components or alternate assembly sources in a timely manner when we needed them  our results of operations could be affected adversely 
we depend on key personnel and on our ability to recruit additional skilled personnel  in a very competitive recruiting environment  to conduct and grow our business effectively 
our future success also depends upon our ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for individuals with skills in the computer telephony software industry is intense  particularly for those with relevant technical and or sales experience 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we can attract  train  assimilate or retain other qualified personnel in the future in the numbers we will require 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have material adverse effects on our business  financial or market performance 
we have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by labor unions 
however  a limited number of sales representatives are responsible for a substantial portion of our direct sales 
the loss of these representatives could adversely affect our future operating results 
we face competitive pressures which may have a materially adverse effect on us 
the market for our computer telephony software products is highly competitive and  because there are relatively low barriers to entry in certain parts of this market  we expect competition to increase in the future 
in addition  because our industry is relatively new and evolving and characterized by rapid technological change  it is difficult for us to predict whether  when and by whom new competing technologies or new competitors may be introduced into our markets 
currently  our competition comes from several different market segments  including computer telephony platform developers  computer telephony applications software developers and telecommunications equipment vendors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
in addition  increased competition or other competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than we can  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products than we can 
current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  including mergers or acquisitions  to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current or prospective end user customers 
some of these competitors also currently have a larger market share than we do and  were they to increase their market share through such cooperative relationships  mergers or acquisitions or through product development  promotion and sale  such developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial or market performance 
because of the competitive  rapidly changing nature of the computer telephony software industry  we must continually identify the most effective means for selling and marketing our products 
the computer telephony software industry is very competitive and rapidly changing 
information technology purchasers can be reluctant to believe that new technology is ready for mass implementation 
as a result  we must continually identify markets for our products and services and apply the most effective means for addressing those markets  both internationally and domestically 
we are required to have a thorough understanding of the industry s direction and an appreciation for the end user s demands for functionality 
we are also required to effectively balance both direct and indirect sales channels and to train our sales force to find new customers and further develop our installed customer base while keeping thoroughly familiar with our products and product mix 
if we are unable to generate increasing revenues through focused attention on these sales and marketing elements  we could cause material adverse effects on our business  financial or market performance 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights adequately  which could allow third parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization 
we consider our computer telephony software products to be proprietary 
in an effort to protect our proprietary rights  we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as licensing and other agreements with others including our end user customers  consultants  suppliers  and resellers and on employee and third party non disclosure agreements 
these laws and agreements provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights  and the protection they provide varies and may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances 
we have filed a patent application directed to several inventions embodied in our computer telephony software products 
we also hold registered trademarks in countries and pending registrations 
we also hold seven registered copyrights 
because our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization 
a third party could also develop similar technology independently 
also  even though we hold patents and other proprietary rights in our products  the development and sale of our products could violate the proprietary rights of others  including the patent rights of others 
should this be or become the case  we could be required to redesign our products to avoid violating such proprietary rights  or we could be forced to acquire or license those proprietary rights 
any of such alternatives could materially increase the cost of our products and  consequently  their attractiveness to our customers 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which we sell our products do not protect our software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
unauthorized copying  use or reverse engineering of our products or the redesign of our products to avoid proprietary rights held by others or the cost of obtaining necessary technology rights could all materially adversely affect our business  financial or market performance 
comparisons of our period to period operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  our operating results in a future quarter or quarters may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors and  as a result  the price of our common stock may fluctuate 
because we cannot predict when our potential end user customers will place orders and finalize contracts  we cannot accurately forecast our revenues and operating results for future quarters 
we recognize revenues upon satisfaction of the requirements of aicpa statement of position  which generally occurs in the same quarter that the order is received 
as a result  our quarterly revenues and operating results depend primarily on the size  quantity and timing of orders received for our products during each quarter 
if a large number of orders or several large orders do not occur or are deferred or delayed  our revenues in a quarter could be substantially reduced 
our customers could change their minds about our products  and backlog totals as of a certain date may not be indicative of actual revenues 
we can give no assurance that our existing customers will continue their current buying patterns or that changes within their industries will not adversely affect our ability to retain or attract new customers 
in addition  although we believe that all orders in our backlog at december  are firm and will be delivered within the fiscal year  customers can make changes in their orders  or they may alter or significantly delay their delivery schedules or they may even cancel their orders 
therefore  our total backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual revenues for any future period 
if our end user customers do not perceive our products to be effective or high quality  our brand and name recognition will suffer 
we believe that establishing and maintaining brand and name recognition is critical for attracting  retaining and expanding end user customers in our target markets 
we also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will increase as competition in our market increases 
promotion and enhancement of our name will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts and on our success in providing high quality products and related services and on the performance of our resellers  none of which can be assured 
if our end user customers do not perceive our product or related services or those of our resellers to be effective or of high quality  our brand and name recognition would suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial or market performance 
our products could have defects for which we are potentially liable and which could result in loss of revenue  increased costs or loss of credibility or such defects could delay acceptance of our products in the market 
our products  including components supplied by others  may contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite internal product testing  errors in our new products or releases could be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
this could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  or the loss of credibility with current or future end user customers 
this could also result in a loss of revenue or a delay in market acceptance of our products  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial  or market performance 
our license agreements with our end user customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability and some contract claims 
however  not all of these agreements contain these types of provisions but even when they do  these provisions vary as to their terms and may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions 
a product liability  warranty  or other claim brought against us could have a material effect on our business  financial  or market performance 
we may need to license third party technologies and may be unable to do so on acceptable or any terms 
to the extent we need to license third party technologies  we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate licensed technology into our products or services 
third party licenses may expose us to increased risks  including risks associated with the integration of new technology  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition  development and maintenance costs 
our inability to obtain any of such licenses could delay our product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
this  in turn  could adversely affect our business  financial and market performance 
pay per view revenues have declined and our other outsourced electronic capabilities may not supplant those lost revenues the cable tv industry has been introducing new ordering technologies for consumer purchases of pay per view events which do not utilize toll free numbers 
consequently  we are experiencing a downward trend in transaction processing fees  a trend which we expect to continue 
to offset this decline in pay per view services  hosted services is offering other  outsourced electronic capabilities including dialexpress  lead capture  speech enabled directory  and site locators as well as benefits enrollment  broadcast faxing  call center processing  and audiotext 
we cannot give any assurance  however  as to when  if ever  our efforts will completely supplant these declining pay per view revenues 
our stock price has been and could continue to be volatile 
our stock price has been and could continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including  without limitation a 
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  b 
announcements by us  our competitors or our end user customers  c 
changes in financial estimates of securities analysts or investors regarding us  our industry  our competitors or our end user customers  d 
technological innovations or the introduction of new products by us or others  e 
the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies or of our competitors or end user customers  f 
revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet expectations of the investment community  g
