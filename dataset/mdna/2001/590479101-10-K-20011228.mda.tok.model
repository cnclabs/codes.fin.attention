the company deployed the additional regional jet aircraft in performing operations under its code share agreement with us airways 
the deployed aircraft replaced crjs that were redeployed into the america west system 
also in fiscal  the company continued to downsize its turboprop fleet

under a tentative agreement with rac  the company has the right to return bd aircraft  ten of which may be returned immediately and five no earlier than october the company is seeking proposals for the disposition of the remaining six b aircraft 
mesa further reduced its fleet by returning two b aircraft to the lessor upon expiration of their leases in the second quarter  returning five jetstream super aircraft to the lessor in the fourth quarter  and announced a plan to retire the remaining nine jetstream super s in fiscal the terrorist attacks of september  had a significant impact on the company 
following the attacks  the air transportation system was temporarily shut down  resulting in the cancellation of more than  mesa air group flights 
the cancelled flights and loss of consumer confidence in the airline industry resulted in lost revenue from these cancelled flights and lower load factors and revenue yield on flights operated since sept 
the company was also impacted by certain costs incurred during the temporary shutdown that could not be avoided  the write down of receivables related to the company s code share partners as well as the resulting impairment and restructuring charges 
in september  the company recorded as non operating income million associated with amounts claimed under the airline stabilization act 
as of september   the company received million and the remaining million is included in accounts receivable 
the amount recorded as 
table of contents income represents the total amount claimed by the company as the company incurred losses in excess of this amount prior to september th 
amounts paid or payable under the act are subject to audit and adjustment by the federal government 
operating revenues in fiscal  operating revenues increased by million to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the addition of regional jets employed under cost plus contracts with america west and us airways 
capacity  measured by asms  increased by to  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal the increase in capacity was comprised of a increase in jet asms  offset by a decrease in turboprop asms 
passenger traffic is measured by revenue passenger miles rpms  which represent one revenue passenger carried one mile 
rpms increased by to  million in fiscal as compared to  million fiscal the increase in asms and rpms was attributable to the additional regional jet aircraft added in fiscal passenger load factor increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  however  the majority of the company s revenue is derived from cost plus contracts with its major airline partners  and hence  loads are irrelevant to the profitability of the majority of the company s revenue 
operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the million increase was primarily due to increased fuel costs of approximately million  increased lease costs of approximately million and increased pilot wages of approximately million 
these increases were the result of adding additional regional jets in fiscal maintenance expense in fiscal  maintenance expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal increased maintenance expenditures are primarily due to the increased number of activity based or time sensitive maintenance events and the expiration of the warranty period on many of the company s crj aircraft 
aircraft and traffic servicing expense in fiscal  aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the relative stability of aircraft and traffic servicing expense is due to the company serving approximately the same number of cities in as in  versus  respectively 
promotion and sales in fiscal  promotion and sales expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the company s continued downsizing of its bd fleet and the resulting decrease in prorate flying 
given the company s continued expansion of flights performed pursuant to contract agreements  whereby america west and us airways assume the responsibility for promoting and selling seats on flights operated by the company  the company expects this expense to continue to decrease 
general and administrative expense in fiscal  general and administrative expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the million increase is primarily due to 
table of contents million in allowances on receivables from the company s codeshare partners as a result of the impact of the attacks of september th and the impact that the decline in passenger traffic and softening economy have had on their business and ability to pay  million in reserves for professional fees and an increase of approximately million in property taxes as a result of increases to the company s jet fleet 
general and administrative expense consists of items such as payroll  office rent  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal expenses  professional fees  property taxes  passenger liability insurance and other items 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the cessation of depreciation on bd aircraft held for sale 
impairment and restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a charge of approximately million on b aircraft the company either intends to return to the manufacturer or actively market 
the charge is comprised of an impairment loss to write the aircraft down to the contractual selling price market plus the estimated costs to prepare the aircraft for return to the manufacturer 
due to the economic slowdown and the effects of the terrorist attacks in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed an asset impairment test under the provisions of sfas related to its goodwill and b turboprop aircraft 
upon discerning impairment  the company wrote off the unamortized value of the goodwill associated with certain b route systems totaling million 
the company also took an additional charge of approximately million related to its b fleet 
the charge is comprised of an impairment loss of million on the value of bd aircraft the company is planning to continue to fly  an additional market impairment of million on six aircraft the company is holding for sale  but does not have the contractual right to return to the vendor at a specified price 
the assets were written down to their estimated fair market value based upon appraisals 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a decision to discontinue operating jetstream super aircraft from its charlotte hub 
as a result of this decision  the company took a million charge that is included in other accrued liabilities and other non current liabilities at september  the charge is comprised of million related to the present value of the remaining lease payments on nine jetstream super aircraft  million related to the costs to buyout the remaining term of the maintenance contract associated with these aircraft and 
million related to costs to return the aircraft 
the company also elected to accelerate the disposition of excess inventory 
during the fourth quarter  the company hired an independent consulting firm to determine its inventory needs and to value its surplus inventory 
prior to september th  the company had been selling off surplus inventory on a passive basis as opportunities arose 
subsequent to september th  the company made the decision to use third party inventory brokers to sell its excess inventory 
as a result of this decision  the company took a million charge to reduce its surplus inventory to net realizable value  less costs to sell 
the surplus inventory is carried on the balance sheet under the heading of aircraft and parts held for sale 
other income and expense included in other income is million related to amounts received and to be received under the air transportation safety and stabilization act 
this amount is offset by million in net investment related losses unrealized losses of million offset by realized gains of million

passenger load factor increased to in fiscal from in fiscal operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased fuel costs of approximately million  increased lease costs of approximately million and increased pilot wages of approximately million 
these increases were the result of operating additional regional jets

depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the cessation of depreciation on parked d aircraft being disposed 

table of contents other operating items in fiscal  other operating items were de minimis  while in the prior year  the company recorded substantial adjustments related to the shut down of the ual code sharing operation and the reversal of million of previously established reserves which were considered to be excess 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at september   compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at september  the company primarily generated cash by extending the days outstanding in accounts payable as a result of the attacks on september th  receiving payment of million as a result of restructuring various contractual claims the company had with bombardier and drawing million on its line of credit at year end 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in aircraft parts and other fixed assets  spent million preparing aircraft for return to the manufacturer and reduced long term debt by million 
the company also repurchased approximately million of its common stock and realized million in proceeds from exercise of stock options 
the above factors  among others  resulted in a million increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal which comprises the majority of the increase noted above 
as of september   the company had receivables of approximately million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  compared to million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 
million at september  the amounts due consist primarily of receivables due from the company s code share partners  passenger ticket receivables due through the airline clearing house ach and amounts due under the airline stabilization act 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased as a result of the impact of the attacks on september th and the impact that the decline in passenger traffic and softening economy have had on their code share partner s ability to pay 
during fiscal  the company had code share agreements with america west  us airways and midwest express airlines 
approximately  and of the company s consolidated passenger revenue for the years ended september   and  respectively  were derived from these agreements 
accounts receivable from the company s code share partners were and of total accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
a reduction in business travel  a slowing economy and the terrorist attacks of september th  all have had a significant impact on the airline industry  including america west and us airways 
continuing declines in the economy or an inability to receive government grants and loan guarantees could have a material adverse effect on the viability of either of these airlines 
a termination of the america west or us airways code share agreements specifically the jet contracts may have a material adverse effect on the company s business prospects  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if a termination without renewal should occur  management believes they would be able to reduce costs quickly through reducing headcount or parking aircraft 
additionally management believes they could continue flying certain routes or transfer certain aircraft  particularly the regional jets  to new markets and new code share arrangements with other carriers 
as of december   the company had cash and marketable securities in excess of million 
management believes additional proceeds of approximately million could be generated through the cancellation of aircraft orders 
management believes these actions would provide sufficient working capital to meet its operating needs 
in january  the company entered into an agreement with embraer to acquire passenger embraer erj regional jets at an aggregate list price of approximately million 
deliveries began in april and are expected to continue through early the company expects to finance the aircraft with long term operating lease arrangements 
the company has significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to its aircraft fleet 
the leases are classified as operating leases and are therefore excluded from the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at september   the company leased aircraft with remaining lease terms ranging from to 
table of contents years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at september  after september   the company deferred making payments on certain aircraft leases 
subsequently  the company made payments to these lessors or negotiated new terms 
the company s long term debt was primarily incurred pursuant to the acquisition of d aircraft 
at september   the company owned d aircraft securing debt with maturities through due to the september   terrorist attacks and ongoing negotiations with the debt holder  the company ceased making principal and interest payments 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with rac to pay of past due amounts totaling million immediately  with the remaining million due in monthly installments through june in december  the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  approximately million shares  of the outstanding shares of its common stock 
in january  the board approved the repurchase by the company of up to an additional one million shares of its common stock 
as of september   the company has acquired and retired approximately million shares approximately of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million leaving approximately million shares available for repurchase under the current board authorizations 
purchases are made at management s discretion based on market conditions and the company s financial resources 
the company has negotiated year engine maintenance contracts with general electric aircraft engines for its crj aircraft  rolls royce allison for its erj aircraft and pratt and whitney  canada aircraft services for its dash aircraft 
the contracts provide for payment at the time of the repair event for a fixed dollar amount per flight hour  subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices  for the number of flight hours incurred since the previous event 
in december  the company reached an agreement with fleet capital for a million revolving line of credit  secured by the company s inventory and receivables 
the agreement  which expires in december  has provisions which allow the expansion of available credit to million by adding other lenders provided that there is additional collateral 
the company intends to use the facility for general working capital purposes 
there was approximately million outstanding on the line at september  based upon available collateral  
million remained available under the line at september  as of september   the company had erj s  crj s and crj s on firm order 
it is the company s current plan to operate these aircraft under long term operating leases with third party lessors 
the company receives various financing support from the aircraft manufacturers and has not historically experienced significant difficulty obtaining lease financing 
however  the financing markets have become more difficult subsequent to the attacks of september th  and there are no guarantees that financing will be available for future deliveries 
the company has recently obtained a financing commitment from a major lessor for one half of the firm crj and crj deliveries  and currently believes it will be able to finance the remainder of its firm aircraft deliveries 
management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet its operating needs 
this is a forward looking statement 
actual cash flows could materially differ from this forward looking statement as a result of many factors  including the termination of one or more code share agreements  failure to sell  dispose of  or redeploy excess aircraft in a timely manner  a substantial decrease in the number of routes allocated to the company under its code share agreements with its code share partners  reduced levels of passenger revenue  additional taxes or costs of compliance with governmental regulations  fuel cost increases  increases in competition  additional terrorist attacks  increases in interest rates  general economic conditions and unfavorable settlement of existing litigation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations 
under this statement  all business combinations are to be accounted for under one method the purchase method 
the provisions of this statement apply to all 
table of contents business combinations initiated after june  the company has had no business combinations subsequent to june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired individually or in a group of other assets at acquisition and subsequent to acquisition 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption allowed 
the company adopted this statement effective october  and there was no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement will supercede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for i recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and ii measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management has not yet determined the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to its debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio 
the company s debt obligations are primarily variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in an approximately million impact on interest expense 
the company also has investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year  there would be no material impact on the company s interest income 
the company s investments in equity securities are subject to market risk related to fluctuations in share prices for those shares held 
a change in the price of trading securities held at the level of investment at september  would impact the results of the company by approximately 
million 
the company has exposure to certain market risks associated with its aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply 
however  both the us airways and america west contract code share agreements allow fuel costs to be reimbursed by the code share partner  thereby reducing mesa s overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in fiscal  of the company s fuel requirements were associated with these contracts 
each one cent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to a 
million change in annual fuel costs for that portion of fuel expense which cannot be passed on to either america west or us airways
