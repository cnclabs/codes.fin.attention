overview reit conversion 
on july   plum creek timber company  lp  the former partnership and registrant  converted from a master limited partnership to a corporation that is taxed as a real estate investment trust reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  substantially all assets and associated liabilities related to manufacturing operations and harvesting activities and some higher and better use lands were transferred to several unconsolidated corporate subsidiaries 
following the transfers  plum creek timber company  inc  the new corporation and successor registrant  became entitled to approximately of the economic value of the unconsolidated subsidiaries through a combination of preferred stock and nonvoting common stock 
the remaining of the economic value and of the voting control of the manufacturing and harvesting subsidiaries were owned by four individuals who were also officers of the corporation at the time of the reit conversion 
as of january   each of the current three officers and a former officer agreed to sell their shares of the voting stock to the corporation 
the corporation now owns of the voting stock in the unconsolidated subsidiaries 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
the corporation s financial statements reflect the deconsolidation of the manufacturing and harvesting operations along with some higher and better use land sales effective july  therefore  the financial statements for the year ended december  are not comparable to those for the year ended december   which in turn  are not comparable to those for the year ended december  however  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  the corporation has the same five reportable business segments as the former registrant 
furthermore  the segment disclosure has been prepared on a basis consistent with that of the former registrant 
see notes    and of the notes to financial statements for further discussion of how the financial statements have been impacted by the reit conversion 
revenues and expenses for and have been restated in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
revenues have been restated to reclass shipping costs from revenues to cost of goods sold 
see note and of the notes to financial statements 
non recurring items 
during we had the following non recurring items which had an impact on our results of operations timberland sale 
in january  the corporation sold approximately  acres of timberlands and higher and better use lands near st 
maries  idaho for approximately million 
the sale resulted in approximately million of operating income portion of sales proceeds related to higher and better use land and million of non operating income 
merger expenses 
in july  we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to merge with the timber company 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
during  we incurred approximately million of merger related expenses 
these costs have been expensed in the income statement because for accounting purposes the timber company is the acquiring company and have been reported as a separate line item 
manufacturing facilities sale 
in december  one of our unconsolidated subsidiaries sold the southern lumber manufacturing facilities in joyce  louisiana and huttig  arkansas to west fraser timber co 
ltd 
for million plus working capital 
a loss of million was recognized in connection with this sale 
see notes and of the notes to financial statements 
during we had the following non recurring items which had an impact on our results of operations income tax benefit 
in connection with the reit conversion  a one time income tax benefit of approximately million was recorded by the corporation for the net temporary differences associated with the assets and liabilities transferred to the unconsolidated subsidiaries 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
accounting method change 
we changed our accounting policy with respect to reforestation costs and other costs associated with the planting and growing of trees 
the cumulative effect of the accounting method change increased s net income by million 
furthermore  s operating income increased by million as a result of the accounting method change 
see notes and of the notes to financial statements 
reit conversion costs 
in connection with the reit conversion  we incurred million of reorganization costs in and million in see note of the notes to financial statements 
land exchange 
in our cascade region  we received  acres of timberlands plus million of cash from the united states forest service in exchange for  acres of timberlands 
the cash portion of this exchange resulted in a non operating income gain of approximately million 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
events and trends affecting operating results market forces 
the demand for logs and manufactured wood products depends upon international and domestic market conditions  the value of the us dollar in foreign exchange markets  competition  the availability of substitute products and other factors 
in particular  the demand for logs  lumber  plywood and medium density fiberboard is affected by residential and industrial construction  and repair and remodel activity 
these activities are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions  tariffs  interest rates  population growth and other economic  demographic and environmental factors 
additionally  the demand for logs is affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets 
current market conditions 
prices for domestic logs in our cascade region decreased in by from levels 
prices during were under downward pressure during most of the year  and as a result  prices during the second half of were below prices during the same period in the prior year 
the price decline was primarily due to depressed lumber prices and a weak export market 
export log prices in our cascade region increased by in over the prior year but remained weak overall 
the weak price was primarily due to a slow japanese economy and a greater acceptance by the japanese market of substitute products 
prices for domestic logs in our rocky mountain region improved by in compared to however  prices during the second half of were under downward pressure  and as a result  prices for the fourth quarter of were below prices during the same period in the prior year 
the price decline was primarily due to weak lumber and plywood prices 
furthermore  late in the fourth quarter log prices declined further due to lumber and plywood production curtailments and an abundant supply of logs 
the supply of logs has also increased as a result of salvage operations in connection with timber that was burned during the summer 
pulp log and chip prices in the northwest remained weak during  primarily due to the abundant world wide supply of pulp and paper 
prices for sawlogs and pulp logs in our northeast region during increased by over levels 
sawlog prices increased primarily due to the opening of several new mills in the region and pulp log prices increased primarily due to weather related harvesting curtailments 
however  sawlog and pulp log prices in our northeast region during the fourth quarter of were under downward pressure primarily due to weak lumber markets and favorable harvesting conditions 
sawlog prices in our southern region remained weak during primarily due to an abundant supply of logs as a result of favorable harvesting conditions 
furthermore  late in the fourth quarter  sawlog prices declined sharply over primarily due to weak lumber and plywood prices and related production curtailments 
pulp log prices in our southern region decrease by during as compared to the prior year primarily due to an abundant supply of pulpwood as a result of the favorable harvesting conditions 
composite indices for commodity lumber prices were lower in than in  primarily due to the slowing us economy and excess lumber production 
us housing starts during were below the prior year while at the same time lumber production remained strong 
north american lumber production during the first eleven months of was on par with the near record level production for the same period in the prior year 
board prices were also under downward pressure during most of primarily due to the slowing us economy and increased imports 
european imports of boards increased by approximately between and due to the strong us currency and increased european production 
furthermore  late in the fourth quarter  prices weakened further due to the continued demand supply imbalance 
composite indices for commodity plywood prices were lower in than in  primarily due to increased structural panel capacity  declining oriented strand board prices  and lower us housing starts 
new oriented strand board plants that are in the process of being built or expanded are expected to increase north american structural panel capacity by approximately during to during  oriented strand board prices decreased by over compared to the prior year 
industrial and specialty grade plywood prices were also lower in compared to the lower prices were due to weaker demand from industrial customers such as boat and recreational vehicle manufacturers as a result of the slowing us economy and rising energy prices 
medium density fiberboard prices improved by in over however  prices were under downward pressure during the fourth quarter of primarily due to weakening demand 
demand for mdf has weakened due to the slowing us economy and increased use of substitute products 
substitution for north america mdf has increased due to low lumber prices and increased european imports as a result of the strong us currency 
harvest plans 
we determine our annual roundwood sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a continuous block of trees of a similar age  species mix and silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to  acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  a forest s progression from an unmanaged to a managed forest  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
active forest management involves the conversion of a forest from an unmanaged to a managed state 
an unmanaged forest is made up largely of mature and over mature stands of timber which are growing slowly  both in terms of volume and value 
in a managed forest  there exists a range of age classes  from recently planted stands to economically mature stands 
the conversion of a forest from an unmanaged to a managed state can take from one to two forest generations  or rotations 
toward the end of the initial conversion process  a decline in the inventory volume is normal as the harvest of mature and over mature stands ends  and as the younger  faster growing stands have yet to reach final harvest age 
harvest levels in the rocky mountain region were  cunits in and  cunits in  adjusted for the sale of the st 
maries unit in january actual  non adjusted harvest levels in the rocky mountain region were  cunits in harvest levels in are expected to increase over  as normal operating conditions resume following the harvesting disruptions experienced in as a result of the worst fire season in fifty years 
beyond  we expect harvest levels to decline moderately as the process of converting slower growing forests to younger  more productive stands nears completion 
harvest levels in the cascade region including sawlogs and pulpwood were  cunits in  compared to  cunits in harvest levels in are expected to decline by compared to  as the conversion of slower growing forests to younger  more productive stands is completed 
beyond  we expect harvest levels to continue to decline for the foreseeable future  but at a more moderate pace 
harvest levels in the northeast region were  cunits in  compared to  cunits in  and are anticipated to approximate this level for the foreseeable future 
the northeast region s forests are in a managed state where the acreage is relatively evenly distributed among age classes  and harvest levels approximate growth rates 
harvest levels in the southern region were  cunits in and  cunits in during  we substantially completed both the conversion of mature second growth pine timberlands into intensively managed pine plantations and the acceleration of thinning operations to improve growth rates 
harvest levels in are expected to increase over as normal operating conditions resume following the market and weather disruptions experienced in thereafter  we anticipate moderate declines in harvest levels through  followed by a gradual increase as we benefit from faster growing  intensively managed plantations 
actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors that may be outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs and lumber in order to minimize the variance to planned harvest levels 
us canada softwood lumber agreement 
on march   the five year lumber trade agreement between the united states and canada expires 
the agreement was intended to limit the volume of lumber that was exported to the united states through the assessment of a tariff on annual lumber exports in excess of certain levels from the four major lumber producing canadian provinces 
prior to this five year agreement  canadian lumber producers were aggressively increasing their penetration into the united states market as a result of their lower wood fiber costs and favorable exchange rates 
it now appears unlikely that a new agreement will be in place on april  furthermore  it is uncertain whether a new agreement will be reached  and if so  what the effective dates and terms will be 
therefore  it is uncertain to what extent  if any  canadian lumber producers will increase their exports to the united states beginning april   and to what extent  if any  such exports will impact lumber and log prices in the united states 
energy prices 
our unconsolidated subsidiaries consume energy primarily electricity and natural gas in the manufacturing of lumber  plywood and mdf 
our energy costs to date have been relatively stable 
however  due to the current energy shortage  we anticipate that we will be subject to several price increases during as a result  total energy costs for our northwest manufacturing facilities are anticipated to increase between million and million in as compared to  which will negatively impact operating income by a like amount 
comparability of financial statement periods 
we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue the acquisition of additional timberlands to increase our inventories of timber 
on november   we completed the acquisition of  acres in maine 
on october   we completed the acquisition of approximately  plus  acres of leased land acres in louisiana and arkansas 
we may also sell timberlands and facilities  from time to time  if attractive opportunities arise 
on january   we sold approximately  acres of timberlands near st 
maries  idaho 
on december   we sold our two southern lumber facilities 
accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the corporation s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 
results of operations the following table compares operating income by segment for the years ended december operating income by segment in thousands northern resources southern resources lumber panel land sales other total segment operating income merger expenses other costs eliminations total combined operating income less operating income recognized by unconsolidated subsidiaries operating income the accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in note of the notes to financial statements 
for segment purposes  however  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market on the first in  first out method 
the difference in computing cost of goods sold under the last in  first out and first in  first out methods is included in other costs eliminations 
compared to northern resources segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decline was primarily due to lower harvest levels in the rocky mountain region and the cascade region  offset in part by higher sawlog prices in the rocky mountain region and the northeast region 
harvest levels in the rocky mountain region decreased by  cunits or 
excluding the harvest reduction related to the january sale of  acres of timberlands near st 
maries  idaho  harvest levels in the rockies declined by  cunits 
this decline was primarily due to a planned reduction in harvest levels  fire related harvesting restrictions  and weak log markets during the latter part of the year 
harvest levels both export and domestic sawlogs in the cascade region decreased by  primarily due to a planned reduction 
domestic log prices in the rocky mountain region increased by for the year  primarily due to the limited supply of logs in the region during the first half of the year as a result of the decline of federal and state timber sales 
sawlog prices in the northeast region increased by  primarily due to stronger demand as a result of the opening of several new mills in the region 
northern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for northern resources segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower log sales volume in the rocky mountain and cascade regions 
southern resources segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decline in sawlogs sales volume  a decline in pulp log sales volume and a decline in pulp sales prices 
the sawlog sales volume decline is primarily due to an abundant supply of logs throughout the region and an overall planned reduction in harvest levels 
the market was saturated with sawlogs during most of the year as a result of favorable harvesting conditions due to very dry weather  and lumber and plywood production curtailments due to extremely weak product pricing 
the pulp log sales volume decline was primarily due to an overall planned reduction in harvest levels and an excess supply of pulpwood throughout the region 
the supply of pulpwood exceeded demand due to an abundant supply of logs as a result of exceptionally favorable harvesting conditions  and moderating north american demand for pulp and paper 
southern resources segment operating income was as a percentage of its revenues for and for southern resources segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to lower sawlog and pulp log sales volume 
lumber segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in on december   the southern lumber facilities were sold 
excluding these revenues  revenues from our northwest lumber facilities decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to an decline in lumber sales prices  a decline in sales volume and an approximate decline in chip prices 
northwest lumber prices declined primarily due to a demand supply imbalance 
housing starts in the us declined by compared to the prior year while north american lumber production has remained steady 
northwest lumber sales volume declined due to a planned reduction as a result of weak markets and to better align our lumber production with our timberland harvests 
revenues from northwest chip sales decreased by approximately million primarily due to the expiration on december  of a minimum pricing provision under a long term chip supply agreement with a major customer 
lumber segment operating loss was million for the year ended december   compared to operating income of million for this change of million was primarily due to lower sales prices and lower chip revenues 
excluding the operating loss from the southern lumber facilities  the northwest lumber facilities had an operating loss of million 
lumber segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in excluding the costs associated with our southern lumber facilities  costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease in costs for our northwest lumber facilities was primarily due to lower sawmill production 
panel segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a decline in plywood prices  a decline in plywood sales volume and a million decline in proceeds from plywood residuals  principally wood chips 
plywood prices declined primarily due to a demand supply imbalance in the structural panel market  which consists primarily of oriented strand board and plywood 
the demand for commodity plywood has declined modestly due to the decrease in home construction  and the demand for industrial plywood has declined considerably due to lower consumer confidence and higher energy costs 
the supply of structural panels has increased as a result of the recent capacity expansion of oriented strand board 
plywood sales volume has declined due to a planned reduction as a result of weak markets and to better align our plywood production with our timberland harvests 
proceeds from plywood residuals declined primarily due to the expiration on december  of a minimum pricing provision under a long term chip supply agreement with a major customer 
panel segment operating income was as a percentage of its revenues for and for this decline was primarily due to lower plywood sales prices and lower chip revenue 
panel segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in plywood production 
land sales segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to  acres of higher and better use lands being sold during  compared to  acres in land sales segment operating income was as a percentage of its revenues for and for land sales segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  as a result of increased sales 
other costs and eliminations 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead  intercompany log profit elimination and the change in the lifo reserve decreased combined operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in the change of million was primarily due to an increase in the amount of intercompany log profit recognized  offset in part by higher corporate expenses 
the recognition of intercompany log profit increased as a result of the december  sale of the southern lumber manufacturing facilities 
the profit on intercompany log sales is deferred until the lumber and plywood manufacturing facilities convert existing log inventories into finished products and sell them to third parties  at which time intercompany profit is recognized 
corporate expenses increased as a result of higher accruals for long term incentive plans 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to the million of debt transferred on july   to the unconsolidated subsidiaries in the reit conversion and the repayment of borrowings under our line of credit with a portion of the proceeds from our november equity offering 
compared to northern resources segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to million of additional revenue as a result of our maine acquisition in november and higher domestic log prices in both the rocky mountain and cascade regions  offset in part by lower harvest levels in the cascade region and lower export log sales to japan 
domestic log prices in the cascade region increased by  primarily due to continued strong building activity in the united states and the selling of export quality logs to domestic mills 
domestic log prices in the rocky mountain region increased by  primarily due to the limited supply of logs in the region as a result of declining federal and state timber sales and strong building activity 
harvest levels both export and domestic sawlogs in the cascade region decreased by  primarily due to planned harvest reductions 
furthermore  export log sales volume decreased by  primarily due to the weak japanese economy  increased availability of substitute products eg  russian logs and european lumber and the diversion of export quality logs to the stronger domestic market 
northern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for northern resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to million of additional costs as a result of the maine acquisition  offset in part by lower harvest levels in the cascade region and a million decline in reforestation expenses as a result of our change in accounting for reforestation costs 
southern resources segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower sawlog and pulp log prices and lower pulp log sales volume 
sawlog prices decreased by  primarily due to an abundant supply of logs throughout the region and a higher percentage of smaller logs 
log sizes declined in due to the near completion by the end of of the conversion of our mature second growth pine timberlands into intensively managed pine plantations 
pulp log sales volume decreased by  primarily due to a planned reduction in harvest levels as a result of the near completion of accelerated thinning operations to improve growth rates 
pulp log prices decreased by  primarily due to an abundant supply of wood fiber and weak paper markets 
southern resources segment operating income was as a percentage of its revenues for and for this decline was primarily due to lower sawlog and pulp log prices 
southern resources segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to lower pulp log sales volume 
lumber segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in excluding the incremental increase in revenues of million related to the may acquisition of the meridian  idaho remanufacturing facility  revenues increased by million 
this increase was primarily due to a increase in lumber sales volume and a increase in northwest lumber prices 
lumber sales volume increased primarily due to a increase in production volume at our joyce  louisiana sawmill and a increase in production volume at our pablo  montana sawmill as a result of mill reconfiguration projects 
northwest lumber prices increased primarily due to the robust united states economy and strong housing starts 
northwest board prices were also favorably impacted by a temporary reduction of european board imports into the us lumber segment operating income was as a percentage of its revenues for and less than for this increase was primarily due to higher northwest lumber prices and lower southern log costs 
lumber segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in excluding the incremental increase in expense of million related to the may acquisition of the meridian  idaho remanufacturing facility  expenses increased by million 
this increase was primarily due to increased lumber sales volume  offset in part by lower log costs in our southern region 
panel segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher plywood prices and a increase in plywood sales volume 
plywood prices increased by primarily due to the robust united states economy and strong building activity 
during the second and third quarters of  commodity plywood prices reached record high levels due to low field inventories and exceptionally strong building activity 
panel segment operating income was as a percentage of its revenues for and for this increase was primarily due to higher plywood prices 
panel segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a increase in plywood sales volume and a increase in plywood production costs 
plywood production and related costs were increased to capture additional profits associated with record high plywood prices 
land sales segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to  acres of higher and better use lands being sold during  compared to  acres in land sales segment operating income was as a percentage of its revenues for and for land sales segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  as a result of decreased sales 
other costs and eliminations 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead  intercompany log profit elimination and the change in the lifo reserve decreased combined operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in the change of million was primarily due to lower corporate overhead  offset in part by a decline in the amount of intercompany log profit recognized 
corporate overhead decreased by million during  primarily due to million of expense recorded in related to long term incentive plans for which no expense was incurred in deferred intercompany log profit of million was recognized during  compared to million during this decrease of million was primarily due to the build up of log inventories in the southern resources segment in the fourth quarter of and the subsequent processing of these logs in the first quarter of similar log inventories were not built up during the fourth quarter of the profit on intercompany log sales is deferred until the lumber and plywood manufacturing facilities convert existing log inventories into finished products and sell them to third parties  at which time intercompany profit is recognized 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for this increase was primarily due to the issuance of million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of to finance our maine timberland acquisition  offset in part by the million of debt transferred on july   to the unconsolidated subsidiaries in the reit conversion 
general partner interest 
the income allocated to the general partner decreased by million to million for  compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of the general partner interest on july   as a result of the reit conversion 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
prior to july   net income was allocated to the general partner based on of the partnership s net income after adjusting for the incentive distribution  plus the incentive distribution 
financial condition and liquidity net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in as a result of the july  reit conversion  the year to year analysis of the net cash provided by operating activities is not comparable for the following reasons substantially all of the working capital changes after the reit conversion are reflected on the books of the unconsolidated subsidiaries 
however  working capital changes will indirectly affect the corporation through advances to it from the unconsolidated subsidiaries 
the corporation s share of equity earnings from the unconsolidated subsidiaries is not reflected in its net cash provided by operating activity until the earnings are distributed as either a preferred or common stock dividend 
net cash provided by operating activity for was million greater than the prior year not withstanding that on a combined segment basis see note of the notes to financial statements operating income for was million less than the prior year 
net cash provided by operations was higher primarily due to the timing of when earnings from the unconsolidated subsidiaries are distributed to the reit and a favorable working capital variance of million 
earnings of the unconsolidated subsidiaries exceeded distributions by million during  while distributions exceeded earnings by million during the favorable working capital variance is primarily due to the funding in of the fifth and final target under our long term incentive plan that vested on december  and the collection of a note receivable in from a land sale 
net cash provided by operating activity for was million less than the prior year not withstanding that on a combined segment basis operating income for was million greater than the prior year 
net cash provided by operations was lower primarily due to the timing of when earnings from the unconsolidated subsidiaries were distributed to the reit and an unfavorable working capital variance of million 
earnings of the unconsolidated subsidiaries exceeded distributions by million during the unfavorable working capital variance was primarily due to the accrual in for meeting the fifth and final target under our long term incentive plan and the related funding of this plan during on november   we acquired  acres of forest lands in central maine from sd warren company for a total purchase price of million 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
the acquisition was financed with approximately million in cash and the balance with unsecured promissory notes that were issued to the seller 
the notes have an average maturity of approximately ten years 
the face amount of the unsecured promissory notes totals million  with the stated interest rates ranging from to 
the fair market value of the notes at the time of issuance was million  reflecting a note premium due to the notes above market interest rates 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
in november of  the corporation issued  shares of common stock for proceeds of million  net of issuance costs of million 
the proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our line of credit  with the excess invested in money market funds 
on january   we sold approximately  acres of timberlands and higher and better use lands near st 
maries  idaho to crown pacific limited partnership for approximately million 
the sale resulted in approximately million of operating income the portion of the sales proceeds related to higher and better use land and million of gain on sale of assets 
proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness and to invest in our timberlands 
on december   we sold our southern lumber manufacturing operations in joyce  louisiana and huttig  arkansas for million plus working capital to west fraser timber co 
ltd 
the proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the cost of constructing a thin board production line being added to our existing medium density fiberboard facility in columbia falls  montana and to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
we have an unsecured line of credit with a group of banks 
subject to customary covenants  the line of credit allows for borrowings from time to time of up to million for general corporate purposes  including up to million of standby letters of credit 
the line of credit matures on december   and bears a floating rate of interest 
as of december   million was outstanding under the line of credit with million remaining available 
as of january   the entire balance was repaid 
in connection with our financing of the proposed merger with the timber company  we expect to establish a new line of credit 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
absent the merger  we expect to establish a new line of credit by the end of the third quarter of our borrowing agreements contain various restrictive covenants  including limitations on harvest levels  sales of assets  the incurrence of indebtedness and payment of cash dividends 
furthermore  our borrowing agreements restrict distributions to stockholders based on available cash  which is generally our net income after adjusting for non cash charges such as depreciation and depletion  changes in various reserves and capital expenditures and principal payments on indebtedness that are not financed 
in addition  our line of credit requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio on borrowings 
we were in compliance with all of our borrowing agreement covenants as of december  if market conditions experienced during the second half of were to persist for an extended period of time  we expect that the terms of the corporation s current debt agreements would restrict both our ability to incur significant levels of additional debt and our ability to maintain our current dividend level 
however  based upon the pro forma cash flow of the corporation following the merger of the timber company into the corporation  we expect that the corporation will be able to incur all required indebtedness in connection with the merger transaction 
cash required to meet the corporation s financial needs will be significant 
we believe  however  that cash on hand  cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings from a line of credit will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  and interest and principal payments for the next year 
we will distribute to our stockholders per share for the fourth quarter of  payable on february  to stockholders of record as of february  future dividends will be determined by our board of directors  in its sole discretion  based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations and debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on the corporation s ability to make cash payments 
other factors that our board of directors might consider include the appropriate timing of timber harvests  acquisition opportunities  stock repurchases  debt repayment and other means by which the corporation could deliver value to its stockholders 
the corporation s capital expenditures for totaled million compared to million for and million for the amount for does not include million related to the acquisition of timberlands in maine  and the amount for does not include million related to the non cash purchase of timberlands 
after the july  reit conversion  capital expenditures for the manufacturing operations are reflected on the books of the unconsolidated subsidiaries 
capital expenditures for include million for logging roads  reforestation costs and other costs associated with the planting and growing of trees 
capital expenditures for our unconsolidated subsidiaries totaled million  of which approximately million was for the construction of a thin board production line being added to our existing medium density fiberboard facility  and million for additional equipment and upgrades at our other manufacturing facilities 
planned capital expenditures for the corporation and the unconsolidated subsidiaries during are expected to be million 
year capital expenditures related to our manufacturing facilities include million which includes million of capitalized interest for construction of a thin board production line being added to our existing medium density fiberboard facility in columbia falls  montana and million for additional equipment and upgrades for our other manufacturing facilities 
timberland capital expenditures are expected to be million for logging roads  reforestation and other costs associated with the planting and growing of trees
