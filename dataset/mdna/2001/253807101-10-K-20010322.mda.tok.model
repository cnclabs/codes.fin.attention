item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of digimarc  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks related to our business and risks related to our industry and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we assume no obligation to update this information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included herein 
overview digimarc is a leading provider of patented digital watermarking technologies that allow imperceptible digital code to be embedded in the printed or digital versions of media content  such as commercial and consumer photographs  movies  music  magazine advertisements  catalogs  product packages and valuable documents like financial instruments  passports and event tickets 
in addition to a code that can be embedded within various types of media content  our technologies include reader software that  as a resident application on pcs and other devices  enables the recognition of embedded codes 
we believe our technologies have many potential applications 
we are developing products and services to address what we currently believe are our two largest near term market opportunities the deterrence of digital counterfeiting and piracy  and the enhancement of internet access and navigation 
in addition  we continue to pursue commercial applications in audio and video digital watermarking 
from our inception in january through late  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to product development  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
we first generated licensing revenue in the third quarter of through the licensing of our software plug ins to adobe systems 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced a subscription based service for communicating copyrights of digital images across the internet 
this product offering was followed by the introduction in mid of marcspider  our service that searches the internet for images containing digimarc watermarks and produces reports on the locations of these images 
in late  we began expanding the use of our digital watermarking technologies to counterfeiting and piracy deterrence 
in  we began working with a consortium of leading central banks to develop a system to deter the use of personal computer systems in the counterfeiting of currency 
providing services relating to the development of this anti counterfeiting system accounted for of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in we anticipate that this development project will account for most of our revenue until we are able to generate substantial revenue from the introduction of new products that we are developing relating to document security and our digimarc mediabridge system 
in mid  we began to place increasing emphasis on developing the digimarc mediabridge system 
our efforts to develop and introduce the digimarc mediabridge system will require significant continuing investment 
to date  we have derived minimal revenue from the digimarc mediabridge system 
we began marketing the digimarc mediabridge system in the second half of we currently expect to develop other new products and services  which we anticipate selling to customers through a variety of pricing plans  including annual license fees and volume based license fees from commercial printers  packaging companies  magazine advertisers  and magazine publishers 
successful marketing and acceptance of the digimarc mediabridge system  if achieved  would significantly change the mix and the concentration of our future revenue 
to date  we have derived our revenue from licensing software products  delivering subscription based services and providing development and consulting services to the consortium of central banks 
we license our software products to owners of digital images 
revenue is recognized on delivery of software  assuming no significant obligations or customer acceptance rights exist 
we provide subscription services to users for tracking of their watermarked images across the internet 
subscriptions are paid in advance  and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
we also provide development and consulting services related to the customization  integration and installation of our technologies 
this revenue is recognized as services are performed  unless completion is subject to customer acceptance 
revenue from our international sales has primarily been denominated in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our business 
we intend to increase our revenue through increasing adoption of our products and services  marketing new digital watermarking applications  and licensing our intellectual property 
we expect to target  among other sources of revenue  commercial printers  packaging companies  publishers  advertisers and other producers of printed materials 
our aim is to license our technologies to those content producers so that they may embed our digital watermarks in their print media  such as magazine advertisements and articles  direct mail coupons  catalogs  stationery and envelopes  product packaging  labels and tags  trading cards  credit cards  and business cards 
our current and anticipated products are intended to enable content producers to control reproduction and alteration of their content  as well as to enable their print materials to provide a link to relevant web destinations 
revenue from our new applications may include one time license fees  time based or volume based fees  subscription fees  royalties and revenue sharing arrangements 
we anticipate that the calculation of fees and royalties will be based at least in part on the size of the installed base of pcs  cameras  scanners  digital image capture and output devices  and software carrying our patented reader technology as well as the nature of the use  and the nature and amount of licensed content carrying our digital watermarks 
since inception  we have invested in attracting top senior management  in developing our products and technology and in building our sales and marketing organizations 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
we have incurred significant losses to date  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we intend to continue to expend significant financial and management resources on developing additional products and services  increasing sales and marketing activities  improving our technologies and expanding our operations 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur additional losses and negative cash flow through most of  if not all of and possibly beyond 
our revenue may not increase or even continue at its current levels and we may not achieve or maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies deploying new technologies and applications  such as our efforts to develop our digimarc mediabridge system as a new means of using the internet

unless the customer exercises this right  we expect revenue under the agreement to continue at or above current dollar levels for the next year 
the original agreement with the consortium of banks expires at the end of we intend to pursue further business with this customer  including securing a contract for the next phase of development for this customer  as outlined in our original proposal to them  and may be able to achieve other sources of revenue in future periods by providing additional products and services to them and related institutions 
we currently expect to develop new products and services  which we anticipate selling to customers through a variety of pricing plans  including license fees and license fees per document from issuers of valuable documents other than banknotes and from magazine advertisers and publishers
