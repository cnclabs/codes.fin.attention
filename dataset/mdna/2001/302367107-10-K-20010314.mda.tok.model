compared to overview the u 
s 
economy continued at a moderately strong pace in the first half of  continuing its tenth successive year of expansion 
economic expansion continued amidst growing concerns over potential inflation  excessive consumer spending and tight labor markets 
these concerns prompted the federal reserve bank to raise short term rates a quarter of a percentage point in february and march of and a half of a percentage point in may of as a result of these rate increases  the economy in the second half of slowed more rapidly than businesses anticipated causing some backup in inventories 
the equity markets fell and lenders turned more cautious 
this tightening of financial conditions contributed to a restraint on consumer spending 
against this background  economic conditions within the bancorp s operating area in maryland remained generally strong and credit quality has remained at traditionally strong levels 
the bancorp s net income for totaled million or per diluted share compared with million or per diluted share in results for both years included nonrecurring charges and gains  which totaled thousand after tax in and million after tax in primarily for merger related expenses

operating net income    diluted earnings per share results of operations the bancorp s operating results for the year reflected strong revenue growth  with total revenues rising million or to million 
increases occurred in both net interest income and fee generating business as bancorp s strategies and growth initiatives continued to generate strong revenue momentum 
credit losses continued to be modest while loan quality remained strong 
the bancorp continues to initiate technology enhancements and capitalize on acquisition synergies to moderate expense growth 
net interest income f m bancorp s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income for purposes of analysis  is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits 
the presentation provides a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the discussion on net interest income should be read in conjunction with table average balances  interest  and average rates consolidated and table analysis of changes in net interest income 
the bancorp s taxable equivalent net interest income rose million or in to million 
strong loan demand  particularly in commercial real estate and residential mortgage lending  drove the increase  resulting in a net yield on interest earning assets of or basis points higher than most of the new loan growth was funded with the proceeds from maturing securities  core deposit growth and alternative funding sources such as the federal home loan bank 
average yields on both sides of the balance sheet increased from as the overall rate environment increased throughout the increase in rates had a greater effect on interest bearing liabilities due to a spike in the short term rates that these instruments were tied to 
although securities yields increased  the impact on the net interest margin was minimized  due to shrinking volumes and its smaller proportion of interest earning assets 
during  the securities portfolio was allowed to decline to fund part of the loan growth 
at december   there were more than sufficient securities to meet the collateral needs for public funds deposits and other financial arrangements requiring the pledging of securities 
the bancorp funds it s balance sheet with a balanced mix of retail core deposits  customer repurchase agreements and wholesale funding products 
during  the average cost of funds increased basis points due to higher rates on most funding sources 
in addition to a less favorable average rate environment  a less favorable mix in core deposit funding also impacted the bancorp s net interest margin 
most of the deposit increase was in the bancorp s t bill plus money market product 
the combined effect of the change in mix and higher deposit rates resulted in a basis point increase in the average cost of deposits 
noninterest bearing funds had a positive effect on net interest margin 
the average balances of both shareholders equity and noninterest bearing liabilities increased a total of million or  while the average balance of noninterest bearing assets declined million or 
the net effect was an additional million in noninterest bearing funds available to fund interest earning assets 
noninterest bearing demand deposits contributed million of the increase in available noninterest bearing funds 
borrowed funds increased million or as the bancorp sought to fund loan growth 
these funds were primarily short term in nature and the average rate paid on all borrowed funds increased by basis points to 
future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates

provision for credit losses provisions for credit losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for estimated losses based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
management considers the nature of the loan portfolio  credit concentrating trends in historical loan experience  specific impaired loans and economic conditions 
management also considers the level of problem assets that the bancorp classifies in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the provision for credit losses was million in  which was million higher than in this increase in the provision resulted primarily from growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans which carry higher levels of credit risk 
noninterest income total noninterest income rose million or to million for the year 
growth occurred in all major categories except gains on sale of loans from mortgage banking activities  with the highest increases in insurance income  deposit account service charges and alternative investment stock brokerage income 
management expects total noninterest income to continue to increase in  based on a stable but slower economic growth outlook and continued focus on insurance  deposit account services  technology based banking  and financial and investment advisory services 
insurance commission income grew million or to million  principally due to the integration of keller stonebreaker and potomac basin insurance subsidiaries into the referral network of the bank s and savings bank s customer base 
team based selling efforts between the insurance subsidiaries and the bank affiliates have brought a vast array of consumer and commercial insurance products to the community bank customer 
revenues from service charges on deposit accounts rose thousand or 
this increase resulted from the conversion of commercial farmers bank customers to the bank s deposit fee schedule in march as well as the overall level of new deposit account customers 
commissions and fees from alternative investments and brokerage services increased thousand or to million 
this increase is associated with the expansion of the investment center  an affiliation with raymond james financial services  as well as fee increases in the trust services business 
the experts in these groups provide innovative financial solutions individually designed for the affluent  emerging affluent and small business customer 
a full range of products is offered including  trust services  portfolio management  financial planning  estate planning  brokerage services  investment counseling and insurance 
bank card income rose thousand or to million 
this income is derived from debit card interchange transactions 
the increase in this product results from increased consumer acceptance of the service  greater marketing focus to raise awareness and higher consumer spending 
gains on sales of loans from mortgage banking activities declined thousand or to million for the year  reflecting reduced sales of fixed rate mortgages due to lower origination volumes 
rising interest rates resulted in a shift in consumer demand toward adjustable rate mortgages  which are generally held in the loan portfolio 
rising interest rates also slowed refinancing activity  resulting in lower origination fees which are also included in this category

employee benefits declined by thousand or to million primarily due to favorable experience in medical and health programs 
merger related expense decreased to thousand in from million in these expenses are largely associated with legal and accounting fees  severance payments  contract terminations  and similar expenses incurred in related to the acquisition and merger of patapsco valley bancshares  inc which closed on december  professional services increased thousand or due to increased outsourcing of non strategic processes as well as fee increases for audit  legal and tax services 
telephone expense increased thousand or primarily due to the bancorp s increased geographic reach into howard county as a result of the recent bank acquisition

tax expense varies with changes in the level of income before taxes  the amount of tax exempt income realized  and the relationship of these changes to each other 
also  the amount of income tax expense differs from the amount computed at statutory rates primarily because the interest realized on state and municipal obligations and certain loans is tax exempt

the effective tax rate  which is the provision for income taxes divided by income before taxes  increased to for compared with for financial condition investment securities the investment securities portfolio is structured and managed to meet several important financial objectives to maintain sufficient balance sheet liquidity to meet any reasonable decline in deposits and any anticipated increase in loans 
to insure safety of principal and interest by investing only in securities permitted by regulation 
to maximize income consistent with liquidity and safety requirements 
to maintain a source of assets which can be pledged as collateral for federal  state and municipal deposits 
the investment securities portfolio is held in two categories for accounting and reporting purposes available for sale afs securities are those which are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily to maturity  and held to maturity htm securities are those for which there is both a positive intent and an ability to hold to maturity

conversely  htm securities  which amounted to million  or of the total portfolio at december   are expected to be held until their scheduled maturities and are composed of longer term  tax exempt state and municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities

this loan growth was fueled by a strong economy in f m bancorp s lending area

other commercial loans increased million or 
consumer loans continued to show strong increases of million or fueled primarily by increases in indirect automobile sales financing and home equity loans 
residential mortgages increased million or as rising interest rates shifted consumer appetites to adjustable rate mortgages that are held in this loan portfolio 
management believes that its underwriting standards are conservative and consistently applied 
although geographically focused on its growing primary marketplace  which has proven to be economically vibrant and stable over the years  bancorp s credit risk is well diversified as to loan type and average loan size

the bancorp manages liquidity at both the parent and subsidiary levels through active management of the balance sheet 
parent company liquidity comes from short term investments that can be sold immediately and from dividends and interest income from subsidiaries 
at december   f m bancorp had million in interest bearing balances at farmers mechanics national bank 
during  amounts available for the payment of dividends aggregated million 
liquidity at the bank and the savings bank is derived from their ability to generate core deposits from a large  diversifed customer base and their ability to purchase noncore money market funds in the us the bank s ability to attract funds in the wholesale markets rests on its strength of capital  collateral availability  earnings  reputation and high quality assets 
the bank draws on a diverse base of wholesale funding sources  including large certificates of deposit  federal funds purchased  and securities sold under repurchase agreement 
the bank and the savings bank also have extensive access to funds from their membership in the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
asset liquidity is maintained through temporary investments  maturity management and the ability to liquidate securities in the available for sale portfolio 
in addition  the bancorp limits the level  maturity and concentrations of noncore funding through policy and internal guidelines 
management regularly reviews liquidity positions and reviews liquidity with the board of directors on a semi annual basis 
market risk and asset liability management market risk is defined as the future changes in market prices that increase or decrease the value of financial instruments  ie cash  investments  loans  deposits and debt 
included in market risk are interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other relevant market risks 
bancorp s primary source of market risk is interest rate risk 
market risk sensitive financial instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of bancorp s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
this risk is driven by potential mismatches resulting in timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and the potential impact of explicit and embedded options 
the goal of asset liability management is to maintain high quality and consistent growth of net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of risk to changes in interest rates  and acceptable levels of capital and liquidity 
this goal is achieved by influencing the maturity and repricing of business and by managing discretionary portfolios 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on bancorp s earnings and capital 
re pricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  bancorp considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies  and other factors 
the bancorp uses a number of tools to measure interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income  monitoring the sensitivity of the net present value of the balance sheet  and monitoring the difference or gap between maturing or rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that interest rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling which calculates expected net interest income based on projected interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the model projections are based upon historical trends and management s expectations of balance sheet growth patterns  spreads to market rates  historical market rate relationships  prepayment behavior  current and expected product offerings and sales activities 
various sensitivity analyses are performed on a regular basis to segregate interest rate risk into separate components and understand the risk attributable to prepayments  caps and floors  and other options 
assumption testing is performed to understand the degree of impact from changing key assumptions such as the speed of prepayments  the interest rate elasticity of core deposit rates and balance sheet growth 
the bancorp s policy guideline limit for net interest income simulation is a negative impact to net interest income of percent for the up or down basis points scenarios when compared with the flat rate scenario 
management has generally maintained a risk position well within the policy guideline level 
the model indicated the impact of a basis point rise in rates over the next months would cause approximately a percent increase in net interest income at december  a basis point decrease in rates over the next months would cause approximately a percent decrease in net interest income 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and changes in deposit levels 
they are not intended to be a forecast and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions that management could take in response to changes in interest rates 
capital resources it is bancorp s policy to maintain a level of capital sufficient to protect the company s depositors  creditors  and shareholders  and to support bancorp s growth 
the principal source of capital is retained earnings 
the board  the occ and the ots maintain capital adequacy guidelines applicable to bancorp  the bank  and the savings bank  respectively  as disclosed in  shareholders equity  notes to consolidated financial statements 
under each measure  bancorp and its subsidiaries were substantially in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and  by definition  were well capitalized at december  and in accordance with regulatory guidelines  fair value adjustments to shareholders equity for changes in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale are excluded from the calculations 
effects of changing prices inasmuch as virtually all of a financial institution s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  changes in interest rates  or the price paid for money  may have a significant effect on earnings performance 
interest rates  though affected by inflation  do not necessarily move in the same direction  or in the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
movements in interest rates are a result of the perceived changes in the rate of inflation and the effects of monetary and fiscal policies 
reference to net interest income and market risk in this section will assist the reader in understanding of how bancorp is positioned to address changing interest rates 
several major categories of noninterest expense are more directly affected by inflationary factors such as salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses 
management endeavors to overcome  or mitigate  the effects of inflation by seeking opportunities to improve operating efficiency and productivity  and by developing strategies for growth that will exceed the projected rate of inflation 
risk elements nonperforming assets table  nonperforming assets and contractually past due loans  displays a five year history of steadily declining nonperforming assets 
totaling just million  or of total consolidated assets at december   bancorp reduced its nonperforming assets at an average annual rate of over the period shown  largely reflecting substantial progress by the savings bank in dealing with the legacy of the late s 
loans that were past due days or more and not classified as nonperforming totaled million at december   or of year end total loans  compared with million one year earlier  or of total loans at december  historically  there has been no direct correlation between loans past due days or more and nonperforming loans or loan losses

when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
no interest is taken into income on nonaccrual loans unless received in cash or until such time as the borrower demonstrates sustained performance over a period of time in accordance with contractual terms 
other real estate owned includes banking premises no longer used for business purposes  real estate acquired by foreclosure in partial or complete satisfaction of debt or otherwise surrendered by the borrower to bancorp s possession 
other real estate owned is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of acquisition or transfer from loans 
write downs to fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
subsequent to transfer  these assets are adjusted through a valuation allowance to the lower of the net carrying value or the fair value net of estimated selling expenses based on periodic appraisals 
nonaccrual loans are not included 
potential problem loans at december   there were million in loans that management had reasonable concerns might become contractually past due or be classified as a nonperforming asset 
these loans are subject to the same close attention and regular credit reviews as extended to loans past due days or more and nonperforming assets 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level  which in management s judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed regularly by management 
additions to the allowance are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
on a quarterly basis  a comprehensive review of the allowance is performed considering such factors as the levels of loans outstanding  loss experience  delinquency levels  certain individual loan reviews  and an evaluation of the regional and national economic environment 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of three primary elements the formula allowance 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying historically determined loss factors to outstanding business loans based on credit risk ratings and for pools of homogeneous loans 
individually risk rated loan loss factors are determined using average annual net charge off rates for the most recent two years 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans 
pooled loan loss factors are based on net charge offs experienced over the past year 
the historic loss factors on the risk rated loans and the pooled loans are then considered for either positive or negative adjustment in an attempt to reflect the current dynamics of the portfolios 
these adjustments in the loss factors are tied to management s evaluation of a number of factors including changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  classified and non accrual assets  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in lending policies  underwriting standards  or collection practices  changes in the experience  ability  depth of lending management and staff  portfolio concentrations  and changes in the national or local economy 
specific allowances for identified problem loans 
the amount of specific reserves is determined through a loan by loan analysis of non performing loans 
the analysis considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral  or other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to repay 
the unallocated allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based on loss factors that cannot be associated with specific loans or loan categories 
these factors include management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  internal audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio segments  etc 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
as reflected in table  at december  the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of total non accrual loans 
this compares to an allowance for loan losses at december  of million  equivalent to of total loans and of non accrual loans 
net charge offs during were thousand more than table  analysis of allowance for credit losses  shows a five year history of activity reflecting relative stability in both the annual charge off ratio and the level of the allowance related to total loans 
bancorp had loans amounting to approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  that were specifically classified as impaired and included in non accrual loans in table at december  the allowance for loan losses was million  consisting of million representing the formula allowance  a thousand specific allowance  and a million unallocated allowance 
table  allocation of allowance for credit losses  discloses management s allocation of the allowance to various loan categories 
this reflects the underlying trends in loan growth and the change in mix 
as they are estimates  this allocation is not intended to limit the amount of the allowance available to absorb losses from any type of loan and should not be viewed as an indicator of the specific amount or specific loan category in which future charge offs may ultimately occur 
see note  loans  notes to consolidated financial statements  for disclosures pertaining to impaired loans and the specific allowance related thereto 
while management believes the allowance for credit losses was adequate at december   the estimate of losses and related allowance may change in the near term due to economic and other uncertainties inherent in the estimation process
