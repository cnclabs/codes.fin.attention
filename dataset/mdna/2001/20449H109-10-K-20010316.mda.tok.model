item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries during the past three years 
the discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
prior information has been restated to reflect the western bancshares  inc acquisition accounted for using the pooling of interests accounting method 
financial institutions acquired by the company during the past three years and accounted for as purchases and immaterial pooling of interests are reflected in the financial position and results of operations of the company since the date of their acquisition 
this report may contain forward looking statements which are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
statements pertaining to future periods are subject to uncertainty because of the possibility of changes in underlying factors and assumptions 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by such forward looking statements for a variety of factors including sharp and or rapid changes in interest rates  significant changes in the economic scenario from the current anticipated scenario which could materially change anticipated credit quality trends and the ability to generate loans  significant delay in or inability to execute strategic initiatives designed to grow revenues and or control expenses  unanticipated issues during the integration of acquisitions  and significant changes in accounting  tax or regulatory policies or requirements 
summary in  the company reported record net income of million  a percent increase over the company s previous high of million in  which represented a percent increase over basic earnings per share for was per share  also a record  compared with per share in and per share in  representing a percent increase in and an percent increase in diluted earnings per share increased to per share in  a percent increase  from per share in diluted earnings per share in increased percent over pretax income for was up million  or five percent  over while income tax expense increased one percent over the same period reflecting a decrease in the company s effective tax rate from percent in to percent in earning assets average earning assets in increased six percent over due principally to a nine percent increase in average loans 
in addition  funds from the sales  calls  maturities and paydowns of the company s securities portfolio were reinvested into higher yielding loans through its securitization program 
during  the company securitized approximately billion of residential mortgage loans and transferred substantially all the balances to available for sale securities 
during  the company securitized and transferred to available for sale securities substantially all of approximately million of residential mortgages and approximately million of indirect automobile loans 
the average earning asset mix in was similar to with loans at percent and percent and investment securities and investment securities available for sale at percent and percent for and  respectively 
in  loans were percent  investment securities and investment securities available for sale were percent 
the mix of earning assets is monitored on a continuous basis in order to place the company in a position to react to interest rate movements and to maximize the return on earning assets 
loans average loans increased nine percent in total loans outstanding at year end increased five percent over previous year end levels 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans  which were percent of total loans  increased percent in compared to the previous year 
real estate construction loans increased percent while commercial mortgage loans increased percent from year end to year end residential

real estate construction loans increased percent while commercial mortgage loans increased percent from year end to year end residential mortgage and consumer installment loans decreased percent and percent  respectively  compared to levels due to the company s securitization activity 
average managed loans  which include loans that have been securitized  increased to billion at december   an percent increase over of the billion in commercial loans at december   billion is typical commercial and industrial lending 
compass focuses primarily on small and middle market businesses whose typical credit requirement is between and million 
the remaining portion of the commercial portfolio is split evenly between real estate construction lending and commercial real estate 
both of these portfolios have experienced double digit growth over the past two years 
the consumer portion of the managed loan portfolio totals approximately billion  with billion in residential mortgages  home equity loans and home equity lines 
during the past two years compass has consciously kept family lending fairly flat due to thin margins and concentrated more on home equity loans and lines 
the remainder of the consumer portfolio is made up of approximately million of in market credit cards and billion of consumer installment loans  about half of which is indirect auto lending 
similar to family residential loans  compass views the indirect auto lending business as a commodity business and has kept the volume fairly flat

table of contents selected loan maturity and interest rate sensitivity rate structure for loans maturity maturing over one year one over one year over predetermined floating or year or through five five interest adjustable less years years total rate rate in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction investment securities the composition of the company s total investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maximizing portfolio yields commensurate with risk and liquidity considerations 
the primary objectives of the company s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the company s interest rate sensitivity position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
the company s investment securities are classified into one of three categories based on management s intent to hold the securities i trading account securities  ii investment securities or iii investment securities available for sale 
securities held in a trading account are required to be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investment securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
securities classified as available for sale are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
for securities classified as held to maturity  the company has the ability  and it is management s intention  to hold such securities to maturity 
management of the maturity of the portfolio is necessary to provide liquidity and control interest rate risk 
maturities of investment securities in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale during totaled million and million  respectively  while sales and maturities in the portfolio in were million and million  respectively 
sales and maturities during were million and billion  respectively 
there were no net gains realized during net gains realized during and accounted for one percent and two percent  respectively  of noninterest income in and gross unrealized gains in the company s investment securities portfolio at year end totaled million and gross unrealized losses totaled million 
total average investment securities  including those available for sale  increased and percent during and  respectively 
the increases were due in part to the securitization and transfer of approximately billion  billion and million of loans to securities available for sale during  and  respectively

during a period of rising rates  prepayment speeds generally slow on mbs and cmos with a resulting extension in average life  and vice versa during declining rates 
at december   given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
similarly  given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
the weighted average market prices as a percentage of par value for mbs and cmos at december   were and  respectively 
the market prices for mbs and cmos generally decline in a rising rate environment due to the resulting increase in average life as well as the below market yield on fixed rate securities and impact of annual and life rate caps on adjustable rate securities 
the opposite is generally true during a period of falling rates 
at december   fixed rate mbs and cmos totaled million and billion  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
adjustable rate mbs and cmos totaled million and billion  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
substantially all adjustable rate mbs and cmos are subject to life rate caps  and mbs are also generally subject to a two percent annual cap 
the weighted average life caps at year end were percent and percent for mbs and cmos  respectively  and the corresponding weighted average coupon rates at year end were percent and percent

table of contents trading account securities and other earning assets securities carried in the trading account  while interest bearing  are primarily held for sale to institutional customers for their investment portfolio and generally are sold within thirty days of purchase 
the volume of activity is directly related to general market conditions and reactions to the changing interest rate environment 
the average balance in the trading account securities portfolio for decreased by percent following a percent decrease in the following table details the composition of the company s trading account at december   and trading account composition december in thousands us treasury and government agency states and political subdivisions mortgage backed pass through securities other securities collateralized mortgage obligations interest rate floors and caps deposits and borrowed funds deposits remain the company s primary source of funding loan growth 
average deposits totaled billion  a six percent increase over prior year levels 
the growth in deposits was primarily attributable to a five percent increase in average transaction accounts noninterest bearing deposits  savings and money market accounts  and interest bearing checking accounts 
as part of its overall funding strategy  the company focuses on the mix of deposits and  in particular  maintaining an appropriate level of transaction accounts as a percentage of total deposits 
during  average transaction accounts made up percent of total deposits  relatively unchanged from the prior two years 
average interest bearing deposits made up percent of total average interest bearing liabilities in  unchanged from  and down slightly from percent in the following table summarizes the maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  maturities of time deposits certificates other time of deposit deposits over over   total in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months 
table of contents while the company continues to emphasize funding earning asset growth through internal deposit generation  average earning asset growth has exceeded that of deposit growth 
as a result  the company has relied more heavily on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding 
borrowed funds consist of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures capital securities and short term borrowings  primarily in the form of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
average borrowed funds increased million and million in and  respectively 
included in other short term borrowings are trading account short sales and the commercial paper of the company 
for a discussion of interest rates and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  and note  capital securities and preferred stock  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the short term borrowings table below presents the distribution of the company s short term borrowed funds and the weighted average interest rates thereon at the end of each of the last three years

table of contents liquidity management liquidity is the ability of the company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of its customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities they serve 
additionally  the parent holding company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  business combinations  capital injections to its subsidiaries  the servicing of debt  and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent holding company is dividends from the subsidiary banks 
at december   the company s subsidiary banks could have paid additional dividends to the parent holding company of approximately million while continuing to meet the capital requirements for well capitalized banks 
also  the parent holding company has access to various capital markets 
the parent holding company does not anticipate any liquidity requirements in the near future that it will not be able to meet 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the company s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the company can earn a return that meets the investment requirements of its shareholders 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain an acceptable cash position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of investment securities available for sale and trading account securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks  are additional sources of liquidity funding 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and  basically  represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
during and  the company funded the growth in interest earning assets through deposit generation and borrowed funds 
deposits increased by million in and million in fhlb and other borrowings decreased by million in and million in for more information on the composition of the company s long term borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity management the company s net interest income  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by asset liability management committee alco of its subsidiary banks 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 

table of contents the estimated impact on the company s net interest income sensitivity over a one year time horizon at december  is shown below along with comparable prior year information 
such analysis assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates  a static balance sheet and the company s estimate of how interest bearing transaction accounts will reprice in each scenario 
percentage increase decrease in interest income expense given immediate and sustained parallel principal interest rate shifts amount of earning assets  interest down up bearing liabilities basis points basis points in thousands december  assets which reprice in one year or less over one year liabilities which reprice in one year or less over one year total net interest income sensitivity december  assets which reprice in one year or less over one year liabilities which reprice in one year or less over one year total net interest income sensitivity as shown in the table above  the company s net interest income sensitivity decreased from december  to december  net interest income decreased less in the up basis point rate scenario then in the prior year and was almost insensitive to rate changes in the down basis point rate scenario 
the decreased sensitivity was due  in large part  to the significant decrease in the general level of market interest rates at the end of as a result  the projected prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in both the up and down rate scenarios were higher at december   than the previous year 
the increased projected prepayments in the down rate scenario resulted in a larger amount of cash flows requiring reinvestment at lower rates  reducing income in the down rate scenario 
conversely  in the up rate scenario  larger prepayments resulted in more cash flows being reinvested at higher rates  increasing interest income 
in addition to the effect of lower interest rates  balance sheet changes also caused the overall decrease in sensitivity 
extension in the maturity of time deposits  changes in deposit repricing sensitivity and employment of targeted up rate protection on a portion of the wholesale liability portfolio  all reduced sensitivity in the up rate scenario 
the extension in the time deposit maturities and deposit repricing sensitivities reduced income in the down rate scenario  resulting in lower variability of income in down rates 

table of contents the alco policy  with which the company complies  is based on the same assumptions as the preceding table and provides that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not reduce net interest income by more than six percent 
the company enters into various interest rate contracts not held in the trading account interest rate protection products to help manage the company s interest sensitivity 
such contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors 
interest rate swaps are contracts where the company typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  generally prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
interest rate caps and floors purchased or written are contracts whereby the company receives or pays  respectively  interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
the income or expense associated with interest rate swaps  caps and floors is ultimately reflected as an adjustment to interest income or expense 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate protection contracts are not reflected in the financial statements until realized 
refer to note  off balance sheet instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of the company s interest rate protection contracts as well as a discussion of interest rate risks  credit risks and concentrations of off balance sheet financial instruments 
the net interest amount received or paid on an interest rate protection contract represents an adjustment of the yield or rate on the respective asset or liability with which such contract is associated 
the gain or loss on a terminated interest rate protection contract is deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the original contract as an adjustment of yield or rate on the asset or liability with which the original contract was associated 
at year end  there were no deferred gains or losses on terminated interest rate protection contracts 
see note  off balance sheet instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements  for details regarding the asset or liability category with which the company s non trading interest protection contracts were associated at december  in addition to interest rate protection contracts used to manage overall interest sensitivity  the company also enters into interest rate contracts for the trading account 
the primary purposes for using interest rate contracts in the trading account are to facilitate customer transactions and to protect cash market positions in the trading account against interest rate movement 
changes in the estimated fair value of contracts in the trading account are recorded in other noninterest income as trading account profits and commissions 
net interest amounts received or paid on interest rate contracts in the trading account are recorded as an adjustment of interest income on trading account securities 
see note  off balance sheet instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements  for a summary of interest rate contracts held in the trading account at december  capital resources shareholders equity increased by million during  primarily due to retained earnings and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
shareholders equity remained relatively unchanged during  primarily due to the net income being offset by dividends  conversion of preferred stock and the unrealized losses in the investment securities available for sale portfolio 
dividends of million were declared on the company s common stock in  representing an percent increase over the annual dividend rate in was 
per common share  a percent increase over the dividend payout ratio was percent  percent and percent for  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue a dividend payout ratio that is competitive in the banking industry while maintaining an adequate level of retained earnings to support continued growth 
subsequent to year end  the company s board of directors approved a five percent increase in the annual dividend rate  raising it to per common share for this marked the twentieth consecutive year the company has increased its dividend 

table of contents a strong capital position  which is vital to the continued profitability of the company  also promotes depositor and investor confidence and provides a solid foundation for the future growth of the organization 
the company has satisfied its capital requirements principally through the retention of earnings 
the company s five year compound growth rate in shareholders equity of percent was achieved primarily through reinvested earnings 
the ratio of average common shareholders equity as a percentage of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength 
overall  the company s capital position remains strong as the ratio of average common shareholders equity to average assets for was percent compared to percent in and percent in in order to maintain this ratio at appropriate levels with continued growth in total average assets  a corresponding level of capital growth must be achieved 
the table below summarizes these and other key ratios for the company for each of the last three years 
return on equity and assets december return on average assets return on average common equity dividend payout ratio average common shareholders equity to average assets ratio in addition to the capital ratios mentioned above  banking industry regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the company and the subsidiary banks are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off of the balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
tier i capital is defined as common shareholders equity  excluding the net unrealized holding gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  plus perpetual preferred stock and the capital securities  minus goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets 
other disallowed intangibles represent intangible assets  other than goodwill  recorded after february  total qualifying capital is defined as tier i capital plus tier ii capital components  which include such items as qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
at december   the company s tier i capital and total qualifying capital totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were percent and percent for tier i and total qualifying capital  respectively  at year end these ratios are well above the minimum requirements of four percent for tier i capital and eight percent for total qualifying capital 
tier i capital increased by million  or percent  in primarily as a result of earnings retained by the company  net of dividends 
two other important indicators of capital adequacy in the banking industry are the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as tier i capital divided by total adjusted quarterly average assets 
average quarterly assets are adjusted by subtracting the average unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  period end goodwill and other disallowed intangibles 
the tangible leverage ratio is defined similarly  except  by definition  all other intangible assets not previously excluded are removed from both the numerator and denominator 
the company s leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end  while its tangible leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end 
table of contents the following table shows the calculation of capital ratios for the company for the last two years

the company continually monitors these ratios to ensure that the subsidiary banks exceed the guidelines

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of a financial institution s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
net interest income for increased percent over after increasing percent in over a six percent increase in the volume of average earning assets along with a basis point increase in the yield were partially offset by a six percent increase in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities along with a basis point increase in the rate 
the increase in was primarily a function of a percent increase in the volume of earning assets offset by an basis point decrease in the yield 
the schedule on pages and provides detail regarding interest income  interest expense and net interest income due to changes in volumes and rates 
the increase in the yield on average earning assets was due to increases in yield in all significant categories of earning assets including a basis point increase in the yield on loans 
the increase in yields was primarily attributable to the repricing of interest earning assets at higher rates  as evidenced by the increases in prime rate during and the increase in average earnings assets was due primarily to a million increase in loans and million increase in investment securities available for sale partially offset by a million decrease in investment securities 
funds from the sales  calls  maturities and paydowns of the company s securities portfolio were reinvested into higher yielding loans through its securitization program 

table of contents total interest expense increased percent in due to a percent increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities along with a basis point increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased by percent as the result of a percent increase in the average volume and a basis point increase in rate 
for borrowed funds  which represents interest bearing liabilities that are not classified as deposits  a percent increase in interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings was a result of a percent increase in the average balance along with a basis point increase in the rate paid 
similarly  a percent increase in the average balance of securities sold under agreement to repurchase and a basis point increase in the rate paid resulted in a percent increase in interest expense in this category 
interest income increased percent in as a result of a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets and a basis point decrease in the average interest rate earned 
the decline in the yield on average earning assets was due to decreases in yield in all significant categories of earning assets including a basis point decline in the yield on loans and a basis point decrease in the yield on investment securities available for sale 
the decline in yields was primarily attributable to the repricing of interest earning assets at lower rates  as evidenced by the reduction in prime rate during the decline in the yield on investment securities available for sale was reduced as a result of the company s securitization and transfer of loans to the investment securities available for sale portfolio during these securitized loans had higher yields than were currently available for similar securities purchased in the open market 
total interest expense increased percent in due to a percent increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities offset partially by a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased by percent as the result of an percent increase in the average volume and a basis point decrease in rate 
for borrowed funds  a percent increase in interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings was a result of a percent increase in the average balance partially offset by a basis point decline in the rate paid 
similarly  a percent increase in the average balance of securities sold under agreement to repurchase and a basis point decrease in the rate paid resulted in a percent increase in interest expense in this category 
net interest income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using the net yield and the interest rate spread 
the net yield on earning assets is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average total earning assets 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net yield decreased basis points to percent in after decreasing basis points to percent in the decline in was due to the basis point increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities which was only partially mitigated by a basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets 
the decline in was due to the basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets  which was only partially offset by a basis point decline in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
during  the net yield on interest earning assets was impacted by the company s use of interest rate contracts  primarily interest rate swaps  decreasing the taxable equivalent net yield on interest earning assets by five basis points 
the greatest impact from the use of interest rate contracts was on the yield and interest income on loans where the net yield was decreased by nine basis points and interest income was decreased by million 
at the same time  the impact of interest rate contracts on interest bearing liabilities was less significant  decreasing interest expense by million 
during and  the net yield on interest earning assets was favorably impacted by the company s use of interest rate contracts increasing the taxable equivalent net yield on interest earning assets by six basis points during and the greatest impact from the use of interest rate contracts was on the yield and interest income on loans where the net yield was increased by eight basis points and nine basis points during and  respectively 
interest income was increased by million and million in and  respectively 
the impact of interest rate contracts on interest bearing liabilities decreased interest expense by million in and less than million in 
table of contents the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased basis points to percent from the spread of percent 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased basis points from the spread of percent 
see the accompanying table entitled consolidated average balance sheets and rate volume variances for more information 
the following table presents certain interest rates without modification for tax equivalency 
the table on pages and contains these same percentages on a taxable equivalent basis 
tax exempt earning assets continue to make up a smaller percentage of total earning assets

table of contents provision for loan losses  net charge offs and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the annual cost of providing an allowance or reserve for estimated losses on loans 
the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
the economic outlook for the states in which the company does business is optimistic 
on a regional basis  however  any economic slowdown in the company s markets could have an effect on most regional financial services companies and could impact overall asset quality 
such an economic slowdown would probably also have a negative impact on real estate lending as well as the level of net charge offs and delinquencies 
management monitors the entire loan portfolio  including loans acquired in business combinations  in an effort to identify problem loans so that risks in the portfolio can be identified on a timely basis and an appropriate allowance maintained 
loan review procedures  including loan grading  are constantly utilized by the company s loan review department in order to ensure that potential problem loans are identified early in order to lessen any potentially negative impact such problem loans may have on the company s earnings 
management s involvement continues throughout the process and includes participation in the work out process and recovery activity 
these formalized procedures are monitored internally by the loan review department whose work is supplemented by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review on an annual basis 
such internal review procedures are quantified in ongoing reports to senior management and are used in determining whether such loans represent potential loss to the company 
a separate set of reports is prepared for consumer installment loans to identify trends unique to that portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established by risk group as follows large classified loans and nonaccrual loans are evaluated individually with specific reserves allocated based on management s review 
smaller nonaccrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
smaller past due loans are assigned a portion of the allowance using a formula that is based on the severity of the delinquency 
the remainder of the portfolio is also allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan portfolio 
allocation weights are assigned based on the company s historical loan loss experience in each loan category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that loan losses may exceed historical experience 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is for inherent losses which probably exist as of the valuation date even though they may not have been identified by the more objective processes used for the allocated portion of the allowance 
this portion of the allowance is particularly subjective and requires judgments based upon qualitative factors which do not lend themselves to exact mathematical calculations 
some of the factors considered are changes in credit concentrations  loan mix  changes in underwriting practices  including the extent of portfolios of acquired institutions  historical loss experience  and the general economic environment in the company s markets 
while the total allowance is described as consisting of an allocated and an unallocated portion  these terms are primarily used to describe a process 
both portions are available to support inherent losses in the loan portfolio 

table of contents at december   the allowance for loan losses increased to million from million at year end this increase in total allowance resulted in an increase as a percent of loans from percent at december  to percent at december  as shown in the following table  net loan charge offs in were million  or percent of average loans  compared with million  or percent of average loans  in and million  or percent of average loans  in the increase in net charge offs during represented a return to historical levels consistent with current economic conditions 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate based on the allowance coverage ratio of approximately two times nonperforming loans  given past experience and the underlying strength of the loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth information with respect to the company s loans and the allowance for loan losses for the last five years

table of contents when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in nonperforming and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and current and projected economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses at december   was million  or percent of loans  compared with million  or percent of loans  at december   and million  or percent of loans  at december  the portion of the allowance that has not been identified by the company as related to specific loan categories has been allocated to the individual loan categories on a pro rata basis for purposes of the table below

december percent of loans to total amount loans in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage residential commercial consumer installment nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans classified as nonaccrual or renegotiated and foreclosed real estate 
it is the general policy of the company to stop accruing interest income and place the recognition of interest on a cash basis when any commercial  industrial or real estate loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest and the ultimate collection of either is in doubt  unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security 
accrual of interest income on consumer loans is suspended when any payment of principal or interest  or both  is more than days delinquent 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income unless the collateral for the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest or a guarantor assures payment of interest 
nonperforming assets at december   were million  an increase of million from year end nonperforming loans increased million from year end to million

table of contents other accounting issues in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the original effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  which amends sfas no 
sfas no 
addresses a limited number of issues related to the implementation of sfas no 
on january   compass adopted sfas no 
and recognized an asset of million for the fair value of derivative instruments which have been designated as fair value hedges of the company s fixed rate long term debt 
the impact of recognizing this asset was offset entirely by the recognition of an adjustment to long term debt 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company also transferred held to maturity securities with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million into the available for sale category 
there was no income statement impact from the adoption of sfas no

 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires substantial disclosures  but it carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
the statements provide accounting and reporting standards for such transactions based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
under this approach  after a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered  and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
portions of the statement are effective immediately and have been adopted by the company 
other portions become effective for transactions occurring after march  the adoption of the continuing provisions of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new provisions of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and securities portfolios  the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits  and the information related to off balance sheet hedging activities discussed in note  off balance sheet instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  should be considered
