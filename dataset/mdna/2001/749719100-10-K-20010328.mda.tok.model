item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended 
for purposes of these acts  any statement that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed a forward looking statement 
for example  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions may be forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including without limitation  the factors set forth below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
all references to common stock and per share amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the three for two common stock split  declared in february  payable in the form of a common stock dividend to holders of record on march   which will be effected on or about march  we sell our two factor user authentication  encryption and public key management products and solutions to corporate enterprise users seeking turnkey security solutions  and to original equipment manufacturers and developers developer seeking software development components for embedding security in a range of software applications or hardware devices 
in addition to providing e security solutions  in january we formed our rsa capital segment  whose activities relate to our existing and future investments in e businesses and other technology companies 
through our e security solutions segment  we derive our operating revenue primarily from two distinct product groups enterprise solutions  which includes rsa securid authenticators  rsa ace server software  rsa keon software  and maintenance and professional services  and developer solutions  which includes rsa bsafe cryptographic software and protocol products  rsa keon components  and maintenance and professional services 
typically  our enterprise solutions customers complete an initial purchase of a product  then come back to purchase additional or replacement authenticators and software as their use of the product expands to include more users  such as their vendors  suppliers  customers and clients 
at each customer s request  we program our rsa securid authenticators to operate for a fixed period of up to four years 
we typically base our rsa ace server and rsa keon software license fees on the number of users authorized under each customer s license 
with respect to developer solutions  rsa bsafe software licensing terms vary by product  but typically include both an initial fee and ongoing royalties paid as a percentage of the developer s product or service revenue 
often  our existing developer customers go on to license new software or technology from us or wish to increase the field of use rights for the technology they have already licensed 
in such a case  we amend our license agreement with the customer and charge additional licensing fees  thus deriving additional revenue 
with respect to our rsa capital segment our investments have historically consisted of equity instruments  and we expect that most of our future investments will consist of equity instruments as well 
rsa capital holds investments in several public companies  which if their sale is not prohibited by contractual or statutory restrictions  are accounted for as available for sale marketable securities  as well as investments in a number of private companies and restricted public companies  which are accounted for using the cost method 
rsa capital also holds an interest in crosby finance  llc  a qualified special purpose entity  which is accounted for as a held to maturity security 
expenses incurred in connection with these investments are primarily for general and administration  management  and legal matters 
our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are primarily denominated in the local currency 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in markets outside of the united states 
historically  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our profitability and cash flows 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents we have contracted with outside manufacturing organizations to produce our rsa securid authenticators  and some of our products contain technology that is licensed from third parties 
therefore  our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture and delivery of rsa securid authenticators and royalty fees that we pay for the licensed technology 
cost of revenue also includes professional service  customer support  and production costs 
production costs include the programming labor  shipping  inspection and quality control functions associated with the rsa securid authenticators

restructuring in  we commenced and substantially completed consolidation of certain operations in an attempt to achieve operational efficiency 
we recorded costs of million associated with this restructuring during the year ended december  these costs consisted primarily of severance costs for employees who were employed primarily in research and development and general and administrative activities for the formerly separate operations of intrusion detection  inc idi  facility exit costs and other direct costs 
facility exit costs consist primarily of estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to minimum lease payments due under a lease agreement

we routinely evaluate the realizable value of our investments using qualitative and quantitative factors including discounted cash flow analysis and liquidation value assessments 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we sold put and call options on our shares of verisign common stock to independent third parties in order to protect a portion of our marketable securities position 
on december   our entire position in verisign common stock  which totaled  shares  was covered by these put and call options 
on november   we exercised our right to terminate the put and call options on our then remaining  shares of verisign common stock 
the settlement of the put and call options resulted in the sale and delivery of  shares of verisign common stock to one of the independent third parties  resulting in net cash proceeds of zero 
also on november  we entered into three forward contracts and one variable delivery forward contract the derivative instruments with respect to our remaining  shares of verisign common stock 
upon execution of the variable delivery forward contract  we received cash proceeds of million 
upon maturity of each of the forward contracts we expect to receive net proceeds of million in each of the first three quarters of immediately following the execution of the derivative instruments  we contributed our  shares of verisign common stock to the llc  of which we are a member 
at the same time  we entered into an agreement with the llc and the counterparty to the derivative instruments  pursuant to which all of our rights and obligations in the derivative instruments were assumed by the llc

income from investing activities income from investing activities increased approximately in to million from million in income from investing activities in arose primarily from the sale of verisign common stock and the sale of trintech ordinary shares and an increase in value of verisign common stock from the write up under the equity method basis 
these gains are net of our equity in verisign s loss and an 
table of contents investment allowance of million on other investments 
until june   we had accounted for our investment in verisign under the equity method 
after june  investments in verisign common stock were accounted for as marketable securities available for sale

these cash increases were offset by cash used to repurchase our common stock of million  cash used to purchase investments of million and cash used to purchase property and equipment of million  including the purchase of a new facility for our european headquarters 
we expect to receive net cash proceeds of million in each of the first three quarters of upon maturity of each of the forward contracts that are held in crosby finance  llc 
at december   we had an available unused line of credit agreement with a major financial institution 
the line of credit provides for up to million in borrowing at either fixed or variable rates linked to either the london interbank offered rate or the prime rate  until june   subject to annual extension provisions 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures to repurchase our common stock 
we have maintained common stock repurchase programs since october under the current program  we are authorized to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock through october  repurchased shares are used for stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and for general corporate purposes 
we purchased million shares of our common stock during the year ended december   for an aggregate amount of million  or an average cost of per share 
during the year ended december   we received million from the sale of put options on our common stock and those proceeds were used to facilitate our share repurchase program 
the proceeds were recorded as additional paid in capital 
at december   we had outstanding put options covering million shares of common stock  at strike prices ranging from to per share 
these options can only be exercised on certain dates  and expire through the second quarter of we have the option to

we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of xcert for approximately million in cash 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase 
our plans for future uses of cash also include additional investments in preferred and common stock of other companies  additional acquisitions of other entities or technologies  and additional purchases of property and equipment 
we believe that cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we anticipate that current cash on hand  cash from sale of marketable securities and the cash generated from the exercise of employee options and employee stock purchase plans  will be adequate to fund our planned capital and financing expenditures for at least the next twelve months

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results our operating results tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including  among other factors the size  timing and shipment of individual orders for our products  customers deferring their orders in anticipation of new products  changes in our operating expenses  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of our products and our competitors products  market acceptance of new products  changes in the mix of products sold  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in product pricing  including changes in competitors pricing policies  development of our direct and indirect distribution channels  integration of any future acquisitions  the timing of personnel departures and new hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  and general economic conditions 
we may not be able to grow or sustain our profitability from quarter to quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in when revenue is recognized or recognizable can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  some market analysts and economists have recently predicted that the us economy may be weakening 
a general economic slowdown could have serious consequences for our business and operating results 
among other things  a general economic slowdown could reduce our working capital by causing our customers and potential customers to stop buying our products and services  causing a reduction in the value of our investments and making it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling our stock to investors 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
during  our stock price ranged from a per share high of to a low of  as adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split declared in february at the close of the market on february   our stock price was  adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split declared in february announcements  litigation developments and our ability to meet the expectations of brokerage firms  industry analysts and investors with respect to our operating and financial results may contribute to this volatility 
we may not discover  or be able to confirm  revenue or earnings shortfalls until the end of a quarter  which may result in an immediate drop in our stock price 
securities class action litigation is often instituted against publicly traded companies after a period of volatility in the market price of the companies securities 
in december  some of our stockholders filed a class action against us and some of our officers and directors 
this litigation  and other litigation if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
demand for our products depends highly on the continued growth of the market for e security solutions 
the market for e security solutions is at an early stage of development 
demand for our products depends on  among other things the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the public s perception of the need for secure electronic commerce and communications over computer networks  market acceptance and use of public and private key cryptography  digital signatures and digital certificates in communication and commerce  
table of contents the perceived quality  price  availability and interoperability of our products over our competitors products  the pace of technological change  both in the development and use of computer networks generally and in the hardware and software environments in which our products operate  and our ability to keep up with these changes  and general economic conditions 
a well publicized actual or perceived breach of network or data security could trigger a heightened awareness of computer abuse  resulting in an increased demand for security products such as those we offer 
on the other hand  an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at our facilities or at a customer s facilities  whether or not caused by the failure of one of our products  could hurt our reputation and cause potential customers to turn to our competitors products 
electronic security technologies are under constant attack 
the strength of our cryptographic and other e security technologies is constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
any significant advance in the techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable 
our cryptographic systems depend in part on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the security afforded by our encryption products is based on the assumption that the factoring of the composite of large prime numbers is difficult 
if an easy factoring method were developed  then the security of our encryption products would be reduced or eliminated 
even if no breakthroughs in factoring are discovered  factoring problems can theoretically be solved by a computer system significantly faster and more powerful than those currently available 
if these improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems are ever developed  our business or results of operations could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our rsa ace server software and rsa securid authenticators contain a proprietary algorithm 
from time to time  we have learned of attempts by third parties to reverse engineer this algorithm to find vulnerabilities 
if a third party successfully hacks the algorithm and makes its findings public  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the published vulnerabilities 
in addition  some of our customers could require that we replace some or all of their rsa securid authenticators with authenticators containing a more secure algorithm 
if we are required to make these replacements or if we cannot address the vulnerabilities in our algorithm in a timely fashion  then our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
changes in e security technology and standards could render our products obsolete 
the market for e security products is rapidly evolving 
e security technology is constantly changing as we and our competitors introduce new products and retire old ones and as customer requirements quickly develop and change 
in addition  the standards for e commerce and network security continue to evolve 
if any segments of our market adopt technologies or standards that are inconsistent with our products and technology  sales of our products in those market segments could decline 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new  competitively priced products with features that meet changing customer requirements  all in a timely and cost effective manner 
however  we may not be successful in introducing new or enhanced products 
a number of factors  including the following  could have a negative impact on the success of our products quality  reliability or security failure problems  which could result in returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  unexpected service or warranty expenses  reduced orders and a decline in our competitive position  delays or difficulties in product development  undetected software errors or bugs in the final products shipped to our customers  which could cause market acceptance of our products to be lost or delayed  recalls of hardware products incorporating the software or loss of data  
table of contents our competitors introduction of their new products ahead of our new products  or their introduction of superior or cheaper products  the market s failure to accept new technologies  including digital certificate and public and private key management technologies  our failure to include features in our products that our customers or us or foreign government regulators may require  our failure to anticipate changes in customers requirements  and the implementation of standards that are inconsistent with the technology embodied in our products 
we may need to purchase or license technology from third parties in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 
we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology we need and  if we find such businesses  may not be able to purchase or license the technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
some of our products have long sales cycles 
transactions for some of our products  especially our pki products  often involve large expenditures by our customers 
some of our customers may also need to invest substantial resources and modify their computer network infrastructures to take advantage of our products 
therefore  the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable  and the long nature of the sales cycles may impact our quarterly results of operations 
the sales cycles for these transactions are subject to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the education of our customers regarding our products capabilities  customers willingness to make changes in their network infrastructure to take advantage of our products  the timing of customers budget cycles  and customers internal review process 
the market and distribution channels for our products are evolving 
as new distribution channels evolve  we may need to adjust our sales strategy to address these channels 
for example  many businesses are choosing to rent access to enterprise applications from application service providers and other vendors  rather than buying the applications and investing the resources required to set up their own computer networks 
our failure to anticipate new markets or changes in the existing markets for our products could hurt our market share and revenue if our competitors begin selling into the new or expanded market before we do 
we must manage our growth 
our business has grown significantly in size and complexity over the last few years 
for example  since we have nearly doubled the number of people we employ and have added new facilities and significantly expanded our existing facilities in a number of us and non us geographic regions 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
in addition  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our growth 
the geographic dispersal of our operations may also make it more difficult to manage our growth 
we may need to make acquisitions to remain competitive  and acquisitions may hurt our business 
a component of our business strategy is to seek to buy businesses  products and technologies that complement or augment our existing businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the cost of potential transactions  competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to complete any given acquisition 
furthermore  in order to finance a potential acquisition  we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money 
we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing stockholders 

table of contents even if we do complete any given acquisition  the integration of the business and operations of the acquiree into our business and operations is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
before any acquisition  each company has its own business  culture  customers  employees and systems 
following an acquisition  we and the acquiree must operate as a combined organization using common communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resource practices 
in order to successfully integrate acquired companies  we must  among other things  successfully attract and retain key management and other personnel  integrate  both from an engineering and a sales and marketing perspective  the acquired products into our suite of product offerings  coordinate research and development efforts  integrate sales forces  and consolidate duplicate facilities 
an acquisition may disrupt ongoing operations  divert our management from day to day business  impair our relationships with our employees  customers and strategic partners and adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  these types of transactions often result in charges to earnings for such things as transaction expenses  amortization of goodwill  or expensing of in process research and development expenses 
our market is highly competitive 
we compete with established e security companies that currently offer network security products or services  newly organized e security companies that are developing new  competitive products and technologies  and established computer hardware and software companies that introduce their own network security products  either separately or bundled with their existing hardware or software products 
some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to leverage an installed customer base  adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
we believe that we need to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing in order to maintain our competitive position 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position 
in addition  current and potential competitors may establish collaborative relationships to address the security needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances that emerge could pose unforeseen competitive threats 
increased competition could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
we must establish and maintain strategic relationships 
one of our business strategies is to enter into strategic marketing alliances or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach alone through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
if we cannot create relationships with strategic partners  then we will need to devote more resources to sales and marketing 
in addition  we need to create relationships with third parties  including some of our competitors  to ensure that our products will interoperate with the third parties products 
if our products do not work with third parties products used by our customers and potential customers  then our products could lose or fail to achieve market acceptance 
we also license some of the technology contained in our products from third parties 
for example  we license from progress software corporation the relational database management software contained in our rsa ace server and rsa keon software  and we rely on progress software for ongoing maintenance and support for the licensed software 
if any of the technology that we license were to fail or experience significant problems  then we would not be able to fix the problem without the support of the third party licensor 

table of contents we may not be able to find appropriate strategic partners or may not be able to enter into potential relationships on commercially favorable terms 
furthermore  the relationships we do enter into may not be successful 
since our strategic relationships are generally non exclusive  our strategic partners may decide to pursue alternative technologies or to develop alternative products in addition to or instead of our products  either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors 
international sales make up a significant portion of our business 
international sales accounted for more than of our revenue in each of the years ended december   and we intend to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities  and this expansion requires significant management attention and resources 
we may also need to tailor or localize our products in order to compete in particular international markets and to comply with foreign laws 
we may not be able to develop  market and distribute localized versions of our products in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including foreign regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding liability  export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology  difficulties and delays in establishing international distribution channels  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in enforcement of intellectual property rights  and political instability 
if we fail to protect our rights in our proprietary technology  competitors may use our technology  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we also generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  distributors and strategic partners as well as with our customers and potential customers seeking proprietary information  and limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may nonetheless succeed at copying aspects of our products  obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary  or infringing upon our patents and other proprietary rights 
we rely on patents to protect our proprietary rights in our technology  but it is possible that any patent that we or our licensors hold might be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or terminated 
it is also possible that patent examiners might reject the claims described in our pending or future patent applications 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which our products are now  or may in the future be  developed or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our issued us patents expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent 
for example  an important patent covering the rsa public key cryptosystem  which was developed at the massachusetts institute of technology us patent no 
 and licensed exclusively to rsa security  expired on september  an implementation of the cryptographic algorithm described in this patent is embodied in our rsa bsafe cryptographic products 
we believe that 
table of contents the expiration of this patent may encourage competitors to market competing products that previously would have infringed the patent  which could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
the e security industry is highly litigious 
from time to time  we have been involved in disputes with third parties who allege that our products may infringe the intellectual property rights held by the third parties 
any litigation carries a number of significant risks  including litigation is often very expensive  even if it is resolved in our favor  litigation diverts the attention of management and other resources  and if a court or other government agency rules against us in any intellectual property litigation  we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses to the infringing technology  or pay significant monetary damages 
we depend heavily on key  talented employees in a competitive labor market 
our success depends on our ability to attract  motivate and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
in some areas of the united states and in some foreign countries  the demand for these kinds of employees exceeds the supply  and many firms are competing for the few employees with the skills we need 
we believe that our compensation plans are competitive  but we may not be able to hire and retain the employees we need 
in addition  we do not have employment agreements with most of our key employees and do not maintain keyperson life insurance for any of our key employees 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our product components 
although we generally use standard parts and components for our products  some components are currently available only from limited sources 
for example  sanyo electric co  ltd 
and epson electronics are our only suppliers for the microprocessor chips contained in our rsa securid products 
if our suppliers were unable to provide us with a sufficient supply of these or any other components  then we may be unable to fill customer orders and would have to expend significant resources to find new suppliers 
even if we were able to find new suppliers  these suppliers may not be able to produce the components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
we may incur significant costs to avoid investment company status and may suffer serious harm if deemed to be an investment company 
some of our equity investments in other businesses and in rsa ventures  our venture capital fund  may constitute investment securities under the investment company act of a company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding of its total assets 
investment companies must register under and comply with the investment company act unless a particular exclusion or safe harbor provision applies or the company obtains exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission 
if we were deemed to be an investment company  we would become subject to the requirements of the investment company act  which could have a number of serious consequences  including we would be prohibited from engaging in business or issuing our securities as we have in the past  we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with the investment company act  some of our contracts might be voidable  and a court appointed receiver could take control of rsa security and liquidate our business 
although our investment securities currently comprise less than of our total assets  fluctuations in the value of these securities or of our other assets could cause us to exceed this limit 
unless an exclusion from or safe harbor under the investment company act were available to us or we obtained exemptive relief from the sec  we would have to attempt to reduce our investment securities as a percentage of our total assets  
table of contents either by selling some or all of our investment securities or by acquiring non investment security assets 
if we attempt to sell our investment security assets  we may be forced to do so at reduced prices and incur losses or we may incur tax liabilities as a result of the sales 
also  we may be unable to sell some of our investment securities because of legal or contractual restrictions  and there is no assurance that we could find a suitable buyer 
if we attempt to buy non investment security assets  we may not be able to identify or acquire suitable assets on commercially favorable terms or at all 
the value of our business may fluctuate because the value of some of our assets fluctuates 
a portion of our assets includes the equity securities of both publicly traded and non publicly traded companies 
the market price and valuations of the securities we hold may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control  and these fluctuations may result in fluctuations of the market price of our common stock and may reduce the amount of working capital available to us 
in addition  the securities of the private companies in which we invest are generally illiquid  and if these private companies never achieve a liquidity event  such as a public offering or an acquisition  then we may never realize a gain on our investment or even recoup the cost of our investment 
our stockholder rights plan and some provisions of our charter may inhibit potential acquisition bids 
we have a classified board of directors and have also adopted a stockholders rights plan  both of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to complete a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving rsa security 
while these provisions are intended to enable the board to maximize stockholder value  they may have the effect of discouraging takeovers that could be in the best interest of certain stockholders and may therefore have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in the market value of our investments  our common stock and foreign exchange rates 
market fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
we generally purchase our marketable securities in high credit quality instruments  primarily us treasury and government agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and money market investments with contractual maturities of two years or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable securities investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
we routinely evaluate the realizable value of these investments using qualitative and quantitative factors including discounted cash flow analysis and liquidation value assessments 
marketable securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the other comprehensive income section of stockholders equity 
the values recorded for the publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility 
a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities at december  would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we also make equity investments determined by our board of directors 
these investments are either not publicly traded or are publicly traded but we are currently restricted from selling our shares 
these investments are recorded as long term investments on the balance sheet and are carried at cost  as long as our ownership interest is below 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary or mark the investment to fair value and reclass them to marketable securities when appropriate 
crosby finance  llc  of which we are a member  holds shares of verisign common stock  three forward contracts and a variable delivery forward contract derivative instruments 
we expect to receive cash proceeds of million and net gains of approximately million in each of the first three quarters of from the settlement of the forward contracts held by the llc 
the variable delivery forward contract held by the llc will settle in january  and during the period outstanding  could cause us to recognize a loss  if the underlying value of the equity securities becomes impaired 
the derivative instruments provide 
table of contents protection against a portion of the market risk associated with the securities in exchange for our foregoing a portion of the potential price appreciation of the securities 
we routinely assess the realizable value of our interest in the llc and do not expect any material loss from our interest in the llc 
during  we entered into equity instrument contracts indexed to our common stock including put options and forward purchase contracts 
these equity instruments are designed to facilitate the repurchase of our common stock and to minimize the effects of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan exercises on the dilution of earnings per share 
if there is a significant decrease in the market value of our common stock  we could be required to settle the contracts and this could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
these contracts will not have an impact on our results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations and historically  we have not entered into foreign currency hedge transactions 
our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are primarily denominated in the local currency 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars 
between the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this exposure is offset by our use of local currency for operating expenses incurred in those countries 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets  however  we believe that our potential foreign currency exchange rate exposure is not material 
the foregoing risk management discussion and the effects thereof are forward looking statements 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in global financial markets 
the analytical methods we use to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses
