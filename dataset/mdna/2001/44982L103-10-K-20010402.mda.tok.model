at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents compared to  at december  net cash used in operating activities was  in the year ended december    in the year ended december   and  in the year ended december  net cash used for operating activities in each of these periods is primarily a result of net losses and changes in net operating assets

we may also use our cash resources to acquire or license technology  products or business related to our current business 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures until april  we are in the process of securing additional funds to support our working capital requirements and may seek to raise these funds through public or private equity financing  bank debt financing or from other sources 
any of the equity securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that our capital requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise the needed funds  we may be forced to sell assets or discontinue operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
or sab revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the commission 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we believe that the impact of sab will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  which clarifies the application of accounting principles board opinion for certain transactions 
the interpretation addresses many issues related to granting or modifying stock options including changes in accounting for modifications of awards increased life  reduction of exercise price  etc it became effective july  but certain conclusions cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the effects of applying the interpretation have been recognized on a prospective basis from july  the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on the company 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations to date
