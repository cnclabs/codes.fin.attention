in addition  a subsidiary of loral acts as the managing general partner of globalstar  which owns and operates a global telecommunications network designed to serve virtually every populated area of the world by means of a satellite constellation  including four in orbit spares  a satellite operations control center and a ground operations control center the globalstar system 
the globalstar system commenced operations in the first quarter of and as of february   the globalstar system provided coverage to over countries  of which more than half were in full service  served by gateways 
loral  through its interests in various joint ventures  continues to participate and to fund its share of the operations of globalstar service providers in brazil  canada  mexico and russia 
these globalstar service providers have constructed and operate gateways  are licensed to provide services and  through their sales and marketing organizations  are actively selling globalstar service  in their respective territories

in evaluating financial performance  management uses revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as a measure of a segment s profit or loss 
the following discussion of revenues and ebitda reflects the results of loral s operating businesses for  and revenues and ebitda relating to globalstar have been omitted from the tables below 
see note to loral s consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment results 
the remainder of the discussion relates to the consolidated results of loral  unless otherwise noted 
revenues years ended december  in millions fixed satellite services satellite manufacturing and technology    data services segment revenues    affiliate eliminations intercompany eliminations revenues as reported    ebitda years ended december  in millions fixed satellite services satellite manufacturing and technology data services corporate expenses segment ebitda before broadband investment and eliminations broadband investment segment ebitda before eliminations affiliate eliminations intercompany eliminations ebitda as reported fixed satellite services includes of the following companies since their respective dates of acquisition loral cyberstar s transponder leasing business acquired on march  and europe star  since december for the year ended december   satmex s results include million in revenues and million of ebitda from the sale of transponders to loral skynet 
satellite manufacturing and technology consists of of ss l s results 
data services consists of of cyberstar lp in which loral owns an equity interest and of loral cyberstar s data services business since its acquisition on march  represents amounts related to unconsolidated affiliates satmex and europe star 
these amounts are eliminated in order to arrive at loral s consolidated results 
loral s proportionate share of these affiliates is included in equity in net loss from affiliates in loral s consolidated statements of operations 
represents the elimination of intercompany sales and ebitda primarily for satellites under construction by ss l for wholly owned subsidiaries  as well as eliminating sales for the lease of transponder capacity by data services and for satellite manufacturing and technology from fixed satellite services 
ebitda which is equivalent to operating loss before depreciation and amortization  including amortization of unearned compensation is provided because it is a measure commonly used in the communications industry to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance  leverage and liquidity and is presented to enhance the understanding of loral s operating results 
ebitda is not an alternative to net income as an indicator of a company s operating performance  or cash flow from operations as a measure of a company s liquidity 
ebitda may be calculated differently and  therefore  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
segment ebitda before broadband investment and eliminations includes charges for satellite manufacturing and technology of million in relating to increased costs for manufacturing delays and customer contract issues and million in relating to an agreement with chinasat to extend the delivery date of a satellite and other modifications to the contract in return for providing transponders on another loral satellite for their remaining lives 
represents corporate expenses incurred in support of the company s operations 
includes investment in streaming media and broadband services 
compared with segment revenues for loral s operating businesses were billion for versus billion in  before intercompany and affiliate eliminations of million in and million in the decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower revenues in satellite manufacturing and technology due to the timing of bookings  offset in part by strong growth in fss as a result of the faster than expected loading of new satellites placed in service telstar  telstar  telstar apstar iir and telstar and from growth in data services in the decrease in intercompany eliminations in  primarily reflects lower sales by satellite manufacturing and technology to fss 
ebitda as reported increased to million in from million in this increase arose primarily from strong revenue growth from fixed satellite services due to the faster than expected loading of satellites added to our fss fleet and lower pension cost in primarily as a result of better than expected asset returns in  offset by lower satellite manufacturing and technology ebitda  which was due to lower revenues and increased costs relating to manufacturing delays and customer contract issues

also contributing to increased revenues was the inclusion of loral cyberstar s leasing and data businesses for the full year in versus nine months in and other increased revenues at satmex  primarily from the sale of three transponders to loral skynet 
the increase in affiliate eliminations in reflects higher revenues for satmex 
ebitda as reported increased to million in from million in this increase arose primarily from growth in fixed satellite services due to the initiation of service on satellites added to our fss fleet in and increased margins in data services  offset by lower satellite manufacturing and technology ebitda primarily resulting from a million charge relating to an agreement reached with a customer to extend the delivery date of a satellite and other modifications to the contract in return for satellite capacity on another company owned satellite

fixed satellite services loral skynet loral skynet currently has four high power satellites in orbit 
loral intends to expand loral skynet s business to become a worldwide satellite service provider through the construction of additional satellites 
loral cyberstar loral cyberstar currently has three satellites in orbit telstar  telstar and telstar apstar iir 
telstar  originally intended to operate at degrees wl  was launched aboard an ariane launch vehicle in october into the orbital slot located at degrees wl  and commenced operations in january under an agreement reached with eutelsat  loral cyberstar agreed to operate telstar at degrees wl while eutelsat continues to develop its services at degrees wl eutelsat has in turn agreed not to use its degrees wl orbital slot and to assert its priority rights at such location on loral cyberstar s behalf 
as part of this coordination effort  loral cyberstar agreed to provide to eutelsat four mhz transponders on telstar for the life of the satellite and have retained risk of loss with respect to those transponders 
eutelsat also has the right to acquire  at cost  four transponders on the next replacement satellite for telstar as part of the international coordination process  loral continues to conduct discussions with various administrations regarding telstar s operations at degrees wl if these discussions are not successful  telstar s useable capacity may be reduced 
on may   the orion satellite was placed into a lower than expected orbit after its launch on a delta iii rocket 
according to boeing  the delta iii rocket apparently failed to complete its second stage burn  and  as a result  the satellite  manufactured by hughes space and communications corporation  achieved an orbit well below the planned final altitude and could not be used for its intended purpose 
the satellite and launch were fully insured for approximately million  which was received in dacom corporation  a korean communications company which had purchased eight transponders on orion for a total of million  had made prepayments of approximately million to loral cyberstar 
under the agreement with dacom  the amount prepaid was refunded in july to replace orion  on september   loral cyberstar purchased from apt satellite company limited apt for approximately million  the rights to all transponder capacity and existing customer leases on the apstar iir satellite except for one c band transponder retained by apt  and renamed the satellite the telstar apstar iir satellite 
loral cyberstar has full use of the transponders for the remaining life of telstar apstar iir 
loral cyberstar will also have the option to lease from apt replacement satellites upon the end of life of telstar apstar iir 
in march  loral cyberstar made the final payment to apt 
satmex satmex currently has two satellites in orbit solidaridad and satmex and one satellite in inclined orbit morelos 
on august   satmex announced that its solidaridad satellite ceased operation and was irretrievably lost 
the loss was caused by the failure of the back up control processor on board the satellite 
solidaridad  which was built by hughes space and communications hughes and launched in  experienced a failure of its primary control processor in april  and had been operating on its back up processor since that time 
the majority of solidaridad s customers have been provided replacement capacity on other satmex satellites or on satellites operated by loral skynet 
satmex received net insurance proceeds of million relating to the loss of solidaridad in connection with this loss  satmex recognized an after tax gain of million  which resulted from the insurance proceeds in excess of the carrying amount of the satellite and the incremental costs associated with providing replacement capacity  as required by its contracts with its customers 
satmex has contracted with ss l to build a replacement satellite 
this satellite  known as satmex  is scheduled to be launched in  and is designed to provide broader coverage and higher power levels than any other satellite currently in the satmex fleet 
at december   solidaridad had a remaining estimated useful life of eight years 
moreover  solidaridad was manufactured by hughes and is similar in design to solidaridad and to other hughes satellites which have experienced in orbit component failures 
while satmex has obtained in orbit insurance for solidaridad  a satellite failure may result in a drop in satmex s profits  which loss of profits would not be insured 
the in orbit insurance for solidaridad expires in november satmex cannot guarantee that it will be able to renew the insurance at the end of this period  or that if renewal is available  that it would be on acceptable terms 
for example  a renewal policy for solidaridad may not insure against an in orbit failure due to the loss of the satellite s control processor  the same component that caused the loss of solidaridad and other hughes satellites 
an uninsured loss would have a material adverse effect on satmex s results of operations and financial condition 
in may  satelites enigma sa de sa  a subsidiary of principia  sa de cv principia  exercised its option to purchase  shares of satmex preferred stock from loral for million in cash 
loral realized a gain of million in connection with this transaction 
on february   satmex obtained amendments to certain of its debt agreements  which adjusted certain financial covenants 
satmex believes that its future operating cash flow and the availability of its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service its interest and debt repayment requirements and ensure compliance with its debt agreements 
on march   satmex redeemed million of its secured floating rate notes using proceeds from the sale of preferred stock 
on september   satmex redeemed an additional million of its secured floating rate notes 
the related covenants of such debt restrict the ability of satmex to pay dividends to loral 
in connection with the privatization by the mexican government of its fixed satellite services business  loral and principia formed a joint venture  firmamento mexicano  sa de sa de sa holdings 
in  holdings acquired of the outstanding capital stock of satmex 
as part of the acquisition  servicios corporativos satelitales  sa de sa servicios  a wholly owned subsidiary of holdings  issued a seven year government obligation government obligation to the mexican government in consideration for the assumption by satmex of the debt incurred by servicios in connection with the acquisition 
the government obligation had an initial face amount of million  which accretes at and expires in december the debt of satmex and holdings is non recourse to loral and principia 
however  loral and principia have agreed to maintain assets in a collateral trust in an amount equal to the value of the government obligation through december  and  thereafter  in an amount equal to times the value of the government obligation until maturity 
as of december   loral and principia have pledged their respective shares in holdings in such trust 
loral has a economic interest in holdings and a indirect economic interest in satmex 
loral accounts for satmex using the equity method 
satellite manufacturing and technology due to the long lead times required to produce purchased parts and launch vehicles  ss l has entered into various purchase commitments with suppliers 
these commitments aggregated approximately million as of december   and primarily related to satellite backlog 
data services based upon its current expectations for growth  loral cyberstar anticipates it will have additional funding requirements over the next three years to fund the streaming media investment  the purchase of vsats  senior note interest payments  other capital expenditures and other operating needs 
loral cyberstar will need to secure funding from loral  or raise additional financing to fund these requirements 
sources of additional capital may include public or private debt  equity financings or strategic investments 
to the extent that loral cyberstar seeks to raise additional debt financing  its indentures limit the amount of such additional debt and prohibit loral cyberstar from using telstar  telstar apstar iir and telstar as collateral for indebtedness for money borrowed 
if loral cyberstar requires additional financing and is unable to obtain such financing from loral or from outside sources in the amounts and at the times needed  there would be a material adverse effect on loral cyberstar 
broadband investment in keeping with its strategy to redirect the company s resources and attention to its core businesses  the company has substantially revised its plan for participation in the broadband communications market 
at year end  loral determined it would not deploy a proprietary direct to the consumer broadband service  as previously planned  with its attendant time to market  partner  marketing and financial challenges 
rather  loral will participate in the broadband market by providing its customers with satellite platforms for their broadband offerings  through loral s expansion of its fixed satellite services fleet and related capabilities and through its satellite design and production capabilities 
loral believes this strategy will realize revenues and cash flows from the broadband data opportunities earlier than its former approach

the terms of the vendor financing provided for interest at  a maturity date of august  and required repayment pro rata with the term loans due to loral under globalstar s million credit facility discussed above 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility including million of capitalized interest 
in connection with this agreement  qualcomm received warrants to purchase  globalstar partnership interests at an exercise price of per interest 
the exercise price was determined by reference to the fair market value of gtl s common stock on the closing date of the vendor financing  based on an approximate one partnership interest for four shares of gtl common stock 
of the warrants vested on the closing date  vested on september  and will vest on september  the warrants will expire in loral has agreed that if the principal amount excluding capitalized interest of million as of december  outstanding under the qualcomm vendor financing facility exceeds the principal amount outstanding under globalstar s million credit facility to loral  as determined on certain measurement dates  then loral will guarantee of such excess amount 
in february  gtl sold  shares of its common stock to the public under a shelf registration statement filed by globalstar and gtl in july with the sec covering up to million of securities 
gtl used the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million to purchase  ordinary partnership interests in globalstar 
in december  gtl completed a private offering of million of series b convertible redeemable preferred stock the gtl series b preferred stock 
gtl used the net proceeds from this offering to purchase series b convertible redeemable preferred partnership interests rppis of globalstar 
on august   globalstar entered into a million credit agreement with a group of banks for the build out of the globalstar system  of which million was outstanding at december  the credit facility was guaranteed by loral satcom ltd 
and loral satellite  inc in november  the assets of loral satcom ltd

commitments and contingencies loral skynet has entered into prepaid leases and sales contracts relating to transponders on its satellites 
under the terms of the agreements  loral skynet continues to operate the satellites which carry the transponders and provides a warranty for a period of to years  in the case of sales contracts  and the lease term  in the case of prepaid leases 
depending on the contract  loral skynet may be required to replace transponders which do not meet operating specifications 
all customers are entitled to a refund equal to the reimbursement value  as defined  in the event there is no replacement 
in the case of sales contracts  the reimbursement value is determined based on the original purchase price plus an interest factor from the time the payment was received to acceptance of the transponder by the customer  reduced on a straight line basis over the warranty period 
in the case of prepaid leases  the reimbursement value is equal to the unamortized portion of the lease prepayment by the customer 
eleven of the satellites built by ss l and launched since  four of which are owned and operated by loral s subsidiaries or affiliates  have experienced minor losses of power from their solar arrays 
ss l is currently investigating the cause of these failures 
although  to date  neither the company nor any of the customers using the affected satellites have experienced any degradation in performance  there can be no assurance that one or more of the affected satellites will not experience additional power loss that could result in performance degradation  including loss of transponder capacity 
in the event of additional power loss  the extent of the performance degradation  if any  will depend on numerous factors  including the amount of the additional power loss  the level of redundancy built into the affected satellite s design  when in the life of the affected satellite the loss occurred and the number and type of use being made of transponders then in service 
until the cause of the failures can be identified or other adequate remedial measures can be taken  launches of satellites under construction and construction of new satellites may be delayed 
delays in the production or launch of satellites could have a material adverse effect on the operation of ss l s business and the complete or partial loss of satellites could result in a loss of orbital incentive payments and  in the case of satellites owned by loral subsidiaries and affiliates  a loss of revenue and customers 
this investigation is in its very early stages and not all relevant information is now known 
based upon information currently available  including design redundancies to accommodate small power losses and that no pattern has been identified as to the timing or specific location within the solar arrays of the failures  the company believes that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of loral 
in late  following the launch of an ss l built satellite sold to panamsat  a manufacturing error was discovered that affected the geographical coverage of the ku band transponders on the satellite 
on january   panamsat filed an arbitration proceeding in connection with this error claiming damages of million for lost profits and increased sales and marketing costs 
ss l believes it has meritorious defenses to the claim and that its liability is limited to a loss of a portion of the applicable orbital incentives  the estimated impact of which is included in loral s consolidated financial statements 
panamsat has received a recovery from its insurance carrier that should reduce any damage claim 
loral and panamsat have reached an agreement in principle  subject to documentation  and in light of reserves provided  this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of loral 
ss l has an agreement with alcatel space industries pursuant to which the parties have agreed generally to operate as a team on satellite programs worldwide 
in addition  alcatel space has certain rights as a strategic partner of ss l for so long as it continues to hold at least of the loral securities that it acquired in in exchange for ss l stock that it previously owned 
alcatel is permitted two representatives on ss l s seven member board of directors  and certain actions require the approval of its board representatives 
alcatel also has certain rights to purchase ss l shares at fair market value in the event of a change of control as defined of either loral or ss l  including the right to use its loral holdings as part of the ss l purchase price 
these arrangements are terminable upon one year s notice by either party  and ss l gave the contemplated one year notice to alcatel on february  alcatel filed suit on march  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against loral and ss l alleging various breaches of the agreements  seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to enforce its rights thereunder and challenging the effectiveness of the termination 
ss l was informed in that it was a target of a grand jury investigation being conducted by the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia with respect to possible violations of export control laws that may have occurred in connection with the participation of ss l employees on a committee formed in the wake of the crash of a long march rocket in china and whose purpose was to consider whether studies of the crash made by the chinese had correctly identified the cause of the failure 
the company is not in a position to predict the direction or outcome of the investigation 
if ss l were to be indicted and convicted of a criminal violation of the arms export control act  it would be subject to a fine of million per violation and could be debarred from certain export privileges and  possibly  from participation in government contracts 
since many of ss l s satellites are built for foreign customers and or launched on foreign rockets  such a debarment would have a material adverse effect on ss l s business and  therefore  the company 
indictment for such violations would subject ss l to discretionary debarment from further export licenses 
under the applicable regulations  ss l could be debarred from export privileges without being convicted of any crime if it is indicted for these alleged violations  and loss of export privileges would harm ss l s business 
whether or not ss l is indicted or convicted  ss l remains subject to the state department s general statutory authority to prohibit exports of satellites and related services if it finds a violation of the arms export control act that puts ss l s reliability in question  and it can suspend export privileges whenever it determines that grounds for debarment exist and that such suspension is reasonably necessary to protect world peace or the security or foreign policy of the united states 
as far as ss l can determine  no sensitive information or technology was conveyed to the chinese  and no secret or classified information was discussed with or reported to them 
ss l believes that its employees acted openly and in good faith and that none engaged in intentional misconduct 
accordingly  the company does not believe that ss l has committed a criminal violation of the export control laws 
the company does not expect the grand jury investigation or its outcome to result in a material adverse effect upon its business 
however  there can be no assurance as to these conclusions 
on december   the office of defense trade controls  or odtc  of the us department of state temporarily suspended a previously approved technical assistance agreement under which ss l had been preparing for the launch of the chinasat satellite 
according to odtc  the purpose of the temporary suspension was to permit that agency to review the agreement for conformity with then newly enacted legislation section of the arms export control act with respect to the export of missile equipment and technology 
in addition  ss l was required to re apply for new export licenses from the state department to permit the launch of chinasat on a long march launch vehicle  when the old export licenses issued by the commerce department  the agency that previously had jurisdiction over satellite licensing  expired in march on january   the odtc  while not rejecting these license applications  notified ss l that they were being returned without action 
ss l and the state department are now in discussions regarding ss l s obtaining the approvals required for the launch of chinasat in december  ss l reached an agreement with chinasat to extend the date for delivery of the chinasat satellite to july  in return for this extension and other modifications to the contract  ss l provided to chinasat two mhz and one mhz transponders on telstar apstar iir for chinasat s use for the life of those transponders 
as a result  the company recorded a charge to earnings of million in if chinasat were to terminate its contract with ss l as a result of these delays  ss l may have to refund million in advances received from chinasat and may incur penalties of up to million and believes it would incur costs of approximately million to refurbish and retrofit the satellite so that it could be sold to another customer  which resale cannot be guaranteed 
to the extent that ss l is able to recover some or all of its million deposit payment on the chinese launch vehicle  this recovery would offset a portion of such payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that ss l will be able to either obtain a refund from the launch provider or to find a replacement customer for the chinese launch vehicle 
in march  jurisdiction for satellite licensing was transferred from the commerce department to the state department and the state department has issued regulations relating to the export of and disclosure of technical information related to  satellites and related equipment 
it has been ss l s experience that obtaining licenses and technical assistance agreements under these new regulations takes more time and is considerably more burdensome than in the past 
delays in obtaining the necessary licenses and technical assistance agreements may delay ss l s performance on existing contracts  and  as a result  ss l may incur penalties or lose incentive payments under these contracts 
in addition  such delays may have an adverse effect on ss l s ability to compete against unregulated foreign satellite manufacturers for new satellite contracts 
loral holds debt obligations from globalstar see acquisitions and investments 
in a bankruptcy or restructuring proceeding involving globalstar  challenges could be initiated seeking subordination or recharacterization of the debt loral holds from globalstar 
while we know of no reason why such a claim would prevail with respect to the debt loral holds in globalstar  there can be no assurance that such claims will not be made in any restructuring or bankruptcy proceeding involving globalstar 
moreover  there can be no assurance that actions will not be initiated in a globalstar bankruptcy proceeding to characterize payments previously made by globalstar to loral as preferential payments subject to repayment 
loral also may be subject to other claims brought by globalstar creditors and securities holders  who may seek to impose liabilities on the company as a result of the company s relationships with globalstar 
for example  see globalstar related matters below 
the company has estimated the recovery of certain insurance proceeds in its consolidated financial statements as of december   in connection with an insurance claim currently being negotiated with its insurance carrier 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these negotiations will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of loral 
the company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  the company does not believe that any of these other existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations
