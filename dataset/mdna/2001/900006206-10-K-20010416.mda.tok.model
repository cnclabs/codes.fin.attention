item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
from its inception in april until march  the company was engaged primarily in research and development  limited production operations and test marketing of its cooking systems 
in march  the company introduced its first commercial product  the model d cooking system 
in june  the company entered into its first major contract with whitbread plc whitbread and introduced an enhanced product  the model d cooking system 
the company concentrated its efforts on the whitbread rollout throughout upon the completion of the secondary public offering of common stock in june  the company began development of a direct sales organization 
by the end of the first quarter of  the company had substantially developed a us direct sales and european sales infrastructure and marketing programs 
however  the revolutionary nature of the company s technologies  coupled with large restaurant chain operators historical resistance to change and the company s lack of brand strength has limited commercial sales 
during the first quarter of  maytag took action  which the company believes resulted in termination of the ccap and association license agreement 
as a result of these actions  both maytag and the company have filed claims under the arbitration provision of these agreements 
one of the company s claims is that  as a result of its termination of the agreement  maytag is required to pay to the company the remaining balance of minimum royalties that are due under the license agreement of million 
although the company believes that it will prevail on its claims  the outcome of the arbitration proceeding is uncertain 
the termination of the maytag agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in addition  maytag s actions have delayed the company s ability to realize economic value from its rapid cook technologies 
the company intends in the future to seek to enter into non exclusive distribution arrangements with multiple parties in an effort to lessen its reliance on any one single market partner 
the company has invested heavily in research  prototype development  strategic alliance development and sales and marketing personnel 
as a result of these investments  and the heretofore limited revenues generated through sales of cooking systems  the company has incurred substantial operating losses in each year of its operations including net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  although the company has historically incurred significant losses  the company expects to generate future cash flows from the direct sale of its commercial and residential cooking systems  royalties from the sale of its commercial and residential cooking systems  research and development fees for product development and  as necessary  raising capital through future equity or debt financing 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  in january  maytag  in an effort to restructure and return to its core appliance business  discontinued its manufacturing and distribution of its jenn air r accellis tm xp rapid cook system  which incorporated the company s rapid cook technologies 
furthermore  as noted above  the company believes that its relationship with maytag has terminated 
the company believes it will find other channels to distribute its technology into the residential and commercial markets 
in particular  the company intends initially to focus on the southwest and west coast regions of the us furthermore  the company intends to continue its pursuit of potential marketing and manufacturing partners in europe  asia and latin america 
in the second quarter of  the company successfully established a manufacturing venture with shandong xiaoya group in china 
the company expects that the shandong xiaoya group will be producing the c model commercial cooking system in the second quarter of the company intends to continue to pursue business growth through implementation of the following strategies i selling and marketing its model c oven  which is manufactured in china  worldwide to restaurants  hotels  convenience stores and other foodservice operators  ii licensing its next generation technology for residential ovens to partners that have the capability to commercialize it from its current proof of concept state and iii broadening the c model platform beyond the single phase electric unit to include a three phase electric and gas fueled version 
the company s future liquidity will depend upon  among other things  the successful implementation of these initiatives 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in royalty revenues of  received under the company s commercial license agreement with maytag in the last half of this was offset in part by a decrease in product sales of  which was primarily the result of initial replacement parts inventory sold to the company s oven manufacturer in cost of sales for the year ended december   was  compared to  for cost of sales in the prior year 
greater than expected warranty expense related to initial manufacturing problems associated with the production of the company s c and d series ovens is the primary contributor to an increase in costs 
in addition  the company has written down obsolete inventory by approximately  gross profit loss on product sales for the year ended december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the reduction in gross profit was principally due to the costs relating to the upgrade and extended warranty on products sold and the inventory writedown adjustment  as explained above 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is the result of a decrease in engineering and technical personnel to support the company s commercial countertop product development requirements associated with the maytag commercial license and development agreement 
this decrease was offset by expenditures incurred in the development of the company s next generation residential cooking systems and the ongoing operating costs associated with the company s accelerated life cycle testing facility  established for the durability and reliability testing of the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased  to  from  for the year ended december  the increase over is primarily due to an increase in operating costs of  related to the company s manufacturing joint venture in china 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease of  in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were lower because the company transferred its north american sales and marketing operations to maytag in under the commercial license agreement 
other income expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of the gain of  the company recorded when it liquidated its hedged invesment in maytag common stock in the fourth quarter of this gain was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of  which was the result of an increase in outstanding debt used to finance working capital 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   were  and are comparable to revenues of  for the year ended december  a scheduled reduction in payments to the company for research and development activities under the maytag alliance was partially offset by an increase in commercial cooking system sales during cost of sales for the year ended december   were  an increase of  when compared to  for cost of sales in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to an increase in the sales of the company s commercial cooking systems and costs relating to the upgrade and extended warranty on products sold to a major customer in europe 
gross profit on product sales for the year ended december   decreased to  when compared to gross profit on sales of  during the prior year 
gross margin for the year ended december   was of sales  compared to of sales for the year ended december  the reduction in gross profit was principally due to the costs relating to the upgrade and extended warranty on products sold to a major customer in europe 
research and development expenses for the year ended december   increased to  this represents an increase of  from  for the year ended december  the increase is due to additions of engineering and technical personnel to support the company s product development requirements  costs associated with the maytag commercial license and development agreement  development of next generation residential cooking systems and the ongoing operating costs associated with the company s accelerated life cycle testing facility  established for the durability and reliability testing of the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased  to  from comparable expenses of  for the increase over is due to the addition of executive officers and other administrative support personnel and the expansion of the company s european sales and marketing organization 
other expense was  for the year ended december   compared to other income of  for the year ended december  the  increase in expenses is primarily due to accrued interest charges and the amortization of the premium on the purchased put option purchased to hedge against market value fluctuations of the company s maytag common stock 
a portion of such shares were collateral for the company s long term credit facility 
the increase in other expense was partially offset by the elimination of expenses relating to the company s interest in a former joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital requirements in connection with its product and technology development and marketing efforts have been and will continue to be significant 
in addition  capital is required to operate and expand the company s operations 
since its inception  the company has incurred operating losses and has been substantially dependent on loans and capital contributions from its principal stockholders  private placements of its securities and the proceeds from stock offerings 
over the past several years  the company has primarily funded its capital needs with monies received from maytag  sales of securities and revenues generated from operations 
since october  maytag has paid the company an aggregate of million for technology transfer initiatives 
as noted above  the company s relationship with maytag has terminated 
although the company has historically incurred significant losses  the company expects to generate future cash flows from the direct sale of its commercial cooking systems  royalties from the sale of its commercial cooking systems  license fees for the non exclusive licensing of its technologies  research and development fees for product development and  as necessary and available  raising capital through future equity or debt financing 
the company anticipates that it will need to obtain additional sources of funding in order to continue its ongoing operations according to its current plans 
management believes that through sales of its commercial cooking systems  technology transfer fees and the possibility of raising capital through debt and equity financing  the company will have adequate funding for its continued operations and research and development efforts throughout however  if the company is unable to obtain additional financing  it will have to curtail its current level of operations and research and development 
no assurances can be made that the company will actually obtain the necessary funding to finance its operations 
the company s financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
all of the above factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
cash used during fiscal exceeded the company s original forecast  primarily as a result of the following 
the launch of the commercial counter top oven was delayed by about three months from the date originally anticipated by the company  resulting in a delay in the realization of revenues from sales in europe and to the three month deferral of the quarterly minimum royalty payments from maytag 

the company is applying staff resources and funding in connection with the development of its next generation oven ngo 
the prototype ngo s completed by the company are embodied in a full size oven cavity  and may be sold as either a built in wall oven or a freestanding range 
the prototype ngo ovens cook food to times faster than conventional ovens and can accommodate a pound turkey 

certain funds were being applied to the development of the company s internet strategy  the turbochef rapid cook iappliance and certain marketing activities support management s efforts to procure additional funding in the form of research and development sponsorships  strategic alliances and or equity investments 
in january  the company entered into an agreement with banque aig  london branch an affiliate of american international group  inc aig 
the aig facility provided for the company to pledge its maytag shares in the form of a variable stock transaction and to receive cash advances against the value of the maytag shares 
interest was imputed at rates ranging from to 
the company satisfied the then outstanding obligation on november  by surrendering maytag shares equal to the fair value of the obligation 
in july  the company entered into a research and development agreement with the gas research institute gri 
through this agreement  the company received  in funding for the development of gas fueled cooking platforms 
in exchange for the funding  gri received warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock and a percentage of the royalty that the company receives on the sale of various commercial products containing technology developed from the gri funding in north america and europe 
the maximum cumulative royalty that gri will receive under this agreement is million 
during  gri earned royalties of  under this agreement 
in august  the company entered into another agreement with gri in which they purchased million of the company s convertible preferred stock for per share 
the  shares of convertible preferred stock carries a dividend of per annum which is payable in common shares upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock into the company s common stock 
these securities will be converted into shares of the company s common stock on the earlier of the company s next generation residential oven becoming generally available for delivery to consumers in the united states or march  the conversion rate of the convertible preferred stock will be dependent upon the average closing price of the company s common stock over a fixed period of time prior to the conversion date 
at december   the company had working capital of  as compared to working capital of  at december  the  working capital decrease from december  resulted primarily from the sale of the company s marketable securities to repay its long term debt and as a result of negative operating cash flow during fiscal cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  the net loss of  in included  of non cash charges depreciation  amortization  non cash interest and non cash compensation expenses  compared to  in net cash used in operating activities in was negatively impacted by a  decrease in deferred revenue  a  increase in accounts receivable and a  increase in inventory 
these operating cash requirements were partially offset by a  increase in accounts payable 
cash provided by used in investing activities for the year ended december   was  and primarily resulted from the sale of the company s maytag common stock and associated purchased put option for  this was partially offset by equipment and leasehold improvement purchases of  and capitalized patent costs of  cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   of which  was used to repay the company s long term credit agreement with aig 
the company received  through its long term credit agreement with aig in fiscal year  prior to its repayment of the facility in november the company also received  due to the sale of preferred stock during fiscal at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  at december  management continually evaluates its liquidity position 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  the company decreased non core business spending and implemented cost cutting measures 
the company anticipates that it will need to obtain additional sources of funding in order to continue its ongoing operations according to is current plans 
management believes that through sales of its commercial rapid cook systems  minimum royalties  technology transfer fees and the possibility of raising capital through debt and equity financing  the company will have adequate funding for its continued operations and research and development efforts throughout however  if the company is unable to obtain additional financing  it will have to curtail its current level of operations 
no assurances can be made that the company will actually obtain the necessary funding to finance its operations 
in march  the company raised  through the sale of its series b convertible preferred stock 
the dividend on the preferred stock is payable  at the company s option  in either cash or shares of common stock 
the preferred stock is convertible to common stock at per common share representing the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of funding 
in connection with this transaction  the company also issued to the investor warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
these warrants are exercisable in three equal annual installments  commencing one year from the date of issuance and expire in backlog as of december   the amount of backlog orders believed to be firm was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of december  the company anticipates that the majority of this backlog will be filled during the current year 
the december   backlog was positively impacted by the company s transition from marketing its model d cooking system to the model c cooking system  which was introduced in the third quarter of authoritative pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab does not change any existing rules on revenue recognition  rather it provides guidance based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
the company s implementation of sab during the fourth quarter of did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no

the company adopted fin no 
effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  the company s implementation of fin no 
did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value

in additional  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activity 
the company will adopt sfas no 
as of january   as amended  as required for its first quarterly filing of fiscal year we do not believe that this will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
risk factors the company operates in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company s operations 
the following highlights some of the factors that have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s operations 
auditors report 
the auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion with respect to the company s consolidated financial statements at december  the paragraph states that the company s recurring losses from operations and resulting continued dependence on access to external financing sources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
furthermore  the factors leading to and the existence of the explanatory paragraph may adversely affect the company s relationship with customers and suppliers and have an adverse effect on its ability to obtain additional financing 
significant capital requirements  need for additional financing 
to date the company s capital requirements in connection with its technology and product development have been significant and are expected to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future 
the company may also have to expend significant monies for marketing and additional financing will be required to fund anticipated future operating losses 
as a result of the million in gross proceeds the company raised through the sales of its series b convertible stock in march  anticipated sales of its commercial rapid cook systems  minimum royalties technology transfer fees and the possibility of raising additional capital through debt and equity financing  the company believes that it will have adequate funding for its continued operations throughout however  if the company s plans change  or anticipated revenues do not materialize  or actual expenses exceed estimated expenses the company could be required to obtain additional financing sooner 
the company has no current arrangements with respect to  or sources of  additional financing 
even if additional funds are available  the company may not be able to obtain them on a timely basis  or on terms acceptable to it 
failure to obtain additional funds when required could result in the company curtailing or ceasing its operations 
history of losses and expectation of future losses  accumulated deficit  uncertainty of future profitability 
the company has incurred losses of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitable operations in the future 
uncertainty of market acceptance  dependence upon third party marketing arrangements  business factors 
the high speed commercial oven segment of the foodservice equipment industry is an emerging market  characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
as is typical with new products based on innovative technologies  demand for and market acceptance of the turbochef ovens are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
achieving market acceptance for the turbochef ovens will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to increase the foodservice industry s familiarity with the company and to educate potential customers as to the distinctive characteristics and perceived benefits of the turbochef ovens and the company s technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will have available the funds necessary to achieve such acceptance 
moreover  to date  the company has primarily relied upon third parties for its marketing needs 
in addition  the company s future performance will be subject to a number of business factors  including those beyond the company s control  such as economic downturns and evolving industry needs and preferences 
uncertainty of strategic alliances 
in the past the company has pursued a strategy of outsourcing its manufacturing and marketing requirements by entering into strategic alliance with other entities 
while the company believes that any independent distributors  representatives and or licensees with which it enters into such arrangements will have an economic motivation to commercialize the company s products  the time and resources devoted to these activities generally will be contributed and controlled by such entities and not by the company 
a decline in the financial prospects of particular distributors  representatives or licensees or of any of their customers could have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  joint venture or similar arrangements may require financial or other commitments by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able  for financial or other reasons  to finalize any third party distribution or marketing arrangements or that such arrangements  if finalized  will result in the successful commercialization of any of the company s products 
uncertainty of new product development 
although the company s research and development efforts relating to the technological aspects of its next generation oven are substantially completed  the company is continually seeking to refine and improve upon the physical attributes and utility of the turbochef oven 
there can be no assurance that the next generation oven or any future turbochef ovens developed will satisfactorily perform to customer expectations 
moreover  the company is subject to many risks associated with the development of new products based on innovative technologies  including unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of the funds allocated for the completion of such development  which could result in a substantial change in the design  delay in the development  or abandonment of such applications and products 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the next generation oven will be successfully commercialized or that additional products will be successfully developed or that if developed they will meet current price or performance objectives  be developed on a timely basis or prove to be as effective as products based on other technologies 
the inability to successfully complete development of a product or application or a determination by the company  for financial  technical or other reasons  not to complete development of any product or application  particularly in instances in which the company has made significant capital expenditures  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on third party suppliers and manufacturers 
the company generally does not maintain supply agreements with such third parties but instead purchases components and electronic parts pursuant to purchase orders in the ordinary course of business 
the company will be substantially dependent on the ability of its manufacturers and suppliers to  among other things  meet the company s design  performance and quality specifications 
failure by the company s manufacturers and suppliers to comply with these and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturers and suppliers will dedicate sufficient production capacity to meet the company s scheduled delivery requirements or that the company s suppliers or manufacturers will have sufficient production capacity to satisfy the company s requirements during any period of sustained demand 
their failure to supply  or delay in supplying  the company with ovens or components could adversely affect the company s profit margin and the company s ability to meet its own delivery schedules on a timely and competitive basis 
in addition  although the company owns the designs for its specially designed components and believes that alternative sources of supply are available  the company currently purchases all of its specially designed components from a limited number of suppliers and failure by such suppliers to continue to supply the company with these components  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  in the absence of readily available alternative sources  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
industry competition  technological obsolescence 
the cooking and warming segment of the foodservice equipment market is characterized by intense competition 
the company competes with numerous well established manufacturers and suppliers of commercial ovens  grills and fryers including those which cook through the use of conduction  convection  induction  air impingement  infrared  and or microwave heating methods 
in addition  the company is aware of others who are developing  and in some cases have introduced  new ovens based on high speed heating methods and technologies 
although the company is not aware of any competitive products  either being marketed or under development  which it believes are functionally equivalent to the turbochef oven ie that can produce the variety of food items  cooked to the same high quality standards  at the same speeds  there can be no assurance that other companies with the financial resources and expertise that would encourage them to attempt to develop competitive products  do not have or are not currently developing functionally equivalent products  or that functionally equivalent products will not become available in the near future 
most of the company s competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than the company and have established reputations relating to product design  development  manufacture  marketing and service of cooking equipment 
in addition  the market for the company s products and technologies is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards 
accordingly  the company s ability to compete successfully will depend  in large part  on its ability to continually enhance and improve its existing products  complete development and introduce to the marketplace in a timely manner its proposed products  adapt its products to the needs of its customers and potential customers  successfully develop and market new products  and continue to improve operating efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully  that competitors will not develop technologies or products that render the company s products obsolete or less marketable or that the company will be able to successfully enhance or adapt its products  develop new products or lower costs 
potential products liability  warranty expense 
the company is engaged in a business which could expose it to possible liability claims from others  including from foodservice operators and their staffs  as well as from consumers  for personal injury or property damage due to design or manufacturing defects or otherwise 
the company maintains a general liability insurance policy which includes products liability coverage that is subject to a  per occurrence limit with a  aggregate limit and a  umbrella liability insurance policy to cover claims in excess of the limits of its liability insurance 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s insurance or that of any third party manufacturer will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that an adequate level of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost 
a partially insured or a completely uninsured successful claim against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  if the company is successful in its efforts to obtain significant orders for turbochef ovens  the company may be required to install and service  on a timely basis  large numbers of turbochef ovens at its customers locations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide such services on acceptable terms or conditions  or at all 
furthermore  the company generally warrants its products to be free from defects in workmanship and materials for year 
there can be no assurance that future warranty expenses will not have an adverse effect on the company 
patents and proprietary rights 
the company holds certain united states and foreign patents which cover certain fundamental aspects of the company s high speed cooking technologies 
there can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection which existing or future patents  if any  may afford the company  that any patent applications will result in issued patents  that the company s patents  pending patents  registered trademark or registered servicemark will be upheld if challenged or that competitors will not develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of any patent issued to the company 
although the company believes that its patents  the turbochef oven  its trademark and its servicemark do not and will not infringe patents  trademarks or servicemarks or violate proprietary rights of others  it is possible that its existing patent  trademark or servicemark rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents  trademarks  servicemarks or proprietary rights may occur 
in the event the company s products infringe patents  trademarks  servicemarks or proprietary rights of others  the company may be required to modify the design of its products  change the name of its products or obtain a license 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions  or at all 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
although the company has patent insurance to protect and defend its patents  there can be no assurance that the company will have all of the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
moreover  if the company s products infringe patents  trademarks  servicemarks or proprietary rights of others  the company could  under certain circumstances  become liable for damages  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how and employs various methods to protect the concepts  ideas and documentation of its proprietary technologies 
however  such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar know how or obtain access to the company s know how  concepts  ideas and documentation 
furthermore  although the company has and expects to have confidentiality and non competition agreements with its employees and appropriate suppliers and manufacturers  there can be no assurance that such arrangements will adequately protect the company s trade secrets or that others will not independently develop products or technologies similar to those of the company 
possible fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results could vary from period to period as a result of factors such as fluctuations in the length of the company s sales cycle the time between a customer expressing interest in a product and placing an order  as well as from fluctuations in the company s manufacturing cycle the time between the placement of a customer order and the company s ability to fill the order  the purchasing patterns of potential customers  the timing of introduction of new products and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  technological factors  variations in sales by distribution channels and generally non recurring product sales 
regulation and accreditation 
the company is subject to regulations administered by various federal  state  local and international authorities  including those limiting radiated emissions from oven products  which impose significant compliance burdens on the company 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may subject the company to civil and criminal sanctions and penalties 
while the company believes that it and its products are in compliance in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable to such models  including those administered by the united states food and drug administration  the federal communications commission  the european community council and the japanese government s ministry of international trade there can be no assurance of such compliance 
moreover  new legislation and regulations  as well as revisions to existing laws and regulations  at the federal  state  local and international levels may be proposed in the future affecting the foodservice equipment industry 
such proposals could affect the company s operations  result in material capital expenditures  affect the marketability of the company s existing products and technologies and or could limit opportunities for the company with respect to modifications of its existing products or with respect to its new or proposed products or technologies 
in addition  expansion of the company s operations into new markets may require the company to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to comply with additional applicable laws and regulations without excessive cost or business interruption  and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on the company 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price for the company s common stock has been subject to volatility and may continue to be highly volatile as has been the case with the securities of other small capitalization companies 
factors such as the company s financial results  introduction of new products by the company s competitors and various industry factors generally may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s securities 
additionally  in recent years  the stock market has experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and  accordingly  the market prices for many companies  particularly small capitalization companies  the common stock of which trades in the over the counter market  have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies 
nasdaq listing 
the company s common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market  which requires maintenance of certain quantitative and other standards for continual listing 
if the company s common stock were delisted from the nasdaq national market  and if the company meets the continued listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market  the company will apply for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market and trading would continue in this market 
however  if the common stock were delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  trading  if any  would likely be conducted in the over the counter market on the national association of securities dealers otc bulletin board and or on the pink sheets of the national quotation bureau 
as a result  an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our common stock 
in addition  the common stock would be subject to rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of applicable to penny stocks 
the securities and exchange commission has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price as determined pursuant to regulations adopted by the commission or exercise price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
by virtue of being listed on the nasdaq  the company s common stock will be exempt from the definition of penny stock 
if  however  the company s common stock is removed from nasdaq  its securities may become subject to the penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
consequently  the penny stock rules may adversely affect the ability of broker dealers to sell the company s common stock and may affect the ability of purchasers of the company s common stock to sell such securities in the secondary market 
dependence on key personnel 
the company believes that its ability to successfully implement its business strategy is dependent on its management 
the loss of services of one or more of these individuals might hinder the achievement of the company s development objectives 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to hire and retain the qualified personnel needed for its business 
the loss of the services of or the failure to recruit key technical personnel could adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the fourth quarter of  the company sold its investment in maytag common stock and paid the outstanding principal and interest due on the aig credit facility 
the purchase put option  which was an integral part of the aig credit facility was terminated at the same time 
as of december   the company does not have any assets or liabilities that have the potential for market risk that would affect the operating results or cash flow of the company and is not engaged in any hedging activity
