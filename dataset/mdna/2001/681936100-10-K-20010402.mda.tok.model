item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as a consequence of the financial difficulties encountered by a number of the company s operators  the company has recovered various long term care assets pledged as collateral for the operators obligations either in connection with a restructuring or settlement with certain operators or pursuant to foreclosure proceedings 
under normal circumstances  the company would classify such assets as assets held for sale and seek to re lease or otherwise dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable 
however  a number of companies are actively marketing portfolios of similar assets and  in light of the current conditions in the long term care industry generally  it has become more difficult both to sell such properties and for potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire such properties 
as a result  during  million of assets previously classified as held for sale were reclassified to owned and operated assets as the timing and strategy for sale or  alternatively  re leasing  were revised in light of prevailing market conditions 
as of december   the company s portfolio of domestic investments consisted of healthcare facilities  located in states and operated by third party operators 
the company s gross investments in these facilities totaled million at december  this portfolio is made up of long term healthcare facilities and rehabilitation hospitals owned and leased to third parties  fixed rate  participating and convertible participating mortgages on long term healthcare facilities and long term healthcare facilities that were recovered from customers and are currently operated through third party management contracts for the company s own account  including facilities subject to third party leasehold interests 
the company also holds miscellaneous investments and closed healthcare facilities held for sale of approximately million at december   including million related to two non healthcare facilities leased by the united states postal service  worldwide  principal and trust of million and million of notes receivable 
summary financial information the following tables summarize the company s net revenues and real estate assets by asset category for december   and  setting forth the effect of the results of operations of property recovered due to foreclosure and settlements with troubled operators that are held for sale or operated on an interim basis for the company s own account until such time as the properties are sold or re leased

in making investments  the company generally seeks and intends to focus on established  creditworthy  middle market healthcare operators that meet the company s standards for quality and experience of management 
the company seeks to diversify its investments in terms of geographic locations  operators and facility types 
in evaluating potential investments  the company considers such factors as i the quality and experience of management and the credit worthiness of the operator of the facility  ii the facility s historical  current and forecasted cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs  capital expenditures and lease or debt service obligations  providing a competitive return on investment to the company  iii the construction quality  condition and design of the facility  iv the geographic area and type of facility  v the tax  growth  regulatory and reimbursement environment of the community in which the facility is located  vi the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities  and vii the payor mix of private  medicare and medicaid patients 
a fundamental investment strategy of the company is to obtain contractual rent escalations under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases and revenue participation through participating mortgage loans  and to obtain substantial liquidity deposits 
additional security is typically provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth  liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets  and various provisions for cross default  cross collateralization and corporate personal guarantees  when appropriate 
the company prefers to invest in equity ownership of properties 
due to regulatory  tax or other considerations  the company sometimes pursues alternative investment structures  including convertible participating and participating mortgages  that achieve returns comparable to equity investments 
the following summarizes the four primary investment structures currently used by the company 
average annualized yields reflect existing contractual arrangements and an estimate of restructured arrangements for one of the company s troubled operators 
however  in view of the ongoing financial challenges in the long term care industry  no assurance can be given that the operators of the company s facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due 
certain operators have recently indicated to the company that they intend to delay or reduce the payment of their contractual obligations to the company  and therefore the annualized yields as of january  set forth below are not necessarily indicative of or a forecast of actual yields  which may be lower 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the company s consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
purchase leaseback 
the company s owned properties are generally leased under provisions of leases for terms ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
the leases originated by the company generally provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula increases ie  based upon such factors as increases in the consumer price index cpi or increases in the revenues of the underlying properties  with certain fixed minimum and maximum levels 
generally  the operator holds an option to repurchase at set dates at prices based on specified formulas 
the average annualized yield from leases was at january  convertible participating mortgage 
convertible participating mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in revenues of the underlying long term care facilities  with certain maximum limits 
convertible participating mortgages afford the company an option to convert its mortgage into direct ownership of the property  generally at a point six to nine years from inception  they are then subject to a leaseback to the operator for the balance of the original agreed term and for the original agreed participations in revenues or cpi adjustments 
this allows the company to capture a portion of the potential appreciation in value of the real estate 
the operator has the right to buy out the company s option at prices based on specified formulas 
the average annualized yield on these mortgages was approximately at january  participating mortgage 
participating mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in revenues of the underlying long term care facilities  with certain maximum limits 
the average annualized yield on these investments was approximately at january fixed rate mortgage 
these mortgages have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
the average annualized yield on these investments was at january  the following table identifies the years of expiration of the payment obligations to the company under existing contractual obligations as of january   or in the case of one of the company s troubled operators  under an estimated restructured arrangement 
this information is provided solely to indicate the scheduled expiration of payment obligations to the company  and is not a forecast of expected revenues

mortgage rent interest total in thousands thereafter    the table set forth in item properties  herein  contains information regarding the company s real estate properties  their geographic locations  and the types of investment structures as of december  borrowing policies 
the company may incur additional indebtedness and anticipates it will generally maintain a long term debt to total capitalization total capitalization is total shareholders equity plus long term debt ratio in the range of to 
the company intends to review periodically its policy with respect to its debt to total capitalization ratio and to modify such policy as its management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions 
the company s strategy generally has been to match the maturity of its indebtedness with the maturity of its investment assets  and to employ long term  fixed rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time 
the company may use proceeds of any additional indebtedness to provide permanent financing for investments in additional healthcare facilities 
the company may obtain either secured or unsecured indebtedness  and may obtain indebtedness which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock 
where debt financing is present on terms deemed favorable  the company generally may invest in properties subject to existing loans  secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens on properties 
the company has two secured revolving lines of credit the credit facilities which permit borrowings of up to million and million  respectively 
these credit facilities provide working capital for the company and temporary funds for new investments in healthcare facilities 
the company s strategy has been to periodically replace funds drawn on the credit facilities through long term  fixed rate borrowings  the issuance of equity linked borrowings  or the issuance of additional shares of capital stock 
the company also has million of available funds through july  pursuant to an investment agreement with explorer holdings  lp explorer which can be used  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  to fund growth 
following the drawing in full or expiration of this commitment  explorer will have the option to provide up to an additional million to fund growth for an additional twelve month period 
see note shareholders equity and stock options 
industry turmoil and continuing adverse economic conditions have caused the terms on which the company can obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable 
if the company is in need of capital to repay indebtedness as it matures  the company may be required to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum recovery on such investments 
this also could result in adverse tax consequences to the company 
the company may also be required to pursue dilutive equity issuances

government healthcare regulation  reimbursements and industry concentration risks 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal  state and local law  and is directly affected by state and local licensure  fines and loss of certification to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs  as well as potential criminal penalties 
the balanced budget act of the budget act enacted a number of anti fraud and abuse provisions and contains civil monetary penalties for an operator s violation of the anti kickback laws 
the budget act also imposes an affirmative duty on operators to ensure they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the medicare or other governmental programs 
it also provides a minimum ten year period for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs for operators convicted of a prior healthcare offense 
governmental investigations and enforcement of healthcare laws have increased dramatically and are expected to continue to increase 
the increase in governmental investigations  the budget act  future healthcare legislation or other changes in administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  financial condition or results of operations of the company s operators  which could also have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rent and interest payments to the company 
based on information provided by the operators of the company s facilities  the following table sets forth the approximate payor mix for the most recently reported twelve month period medicaid medicare private other total general liability and professional liability costs in the long term care industry have significantly increased over the past several years  with increases in the number and average size of claims 
excluding florida  where recent experience is materially inconsistent with most other states  the number of claims in the long term industry has been increasing annually at a rate of approximately  while the size of such claims has increased 
in florida  the number of claims has been increasing annually at a rate of approximately  while the size of such claims has increased 
the increased magnitude and unpredictability of losses has led a number of insurance companies to exit from the long term care industry  resulting in dramatically increased premiums and increased difficulties in obtaining coverage 
nearly all of the company s properties are used as healthcare facilities  therefore  the company is directly affected by the risk associated with the healthcare industry 
the company s lessees and mortgagors  as well as the facilities owned and operated for the company s account  derive a substantial portion of their net operating revenues from third party payers  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
such programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
due to the implementation of the terms of the budget act  effective january   the majority of skilled nursing facilities shifted from payments based on reimbursable cost to a prospective payment system pps for services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
implementation of pps has affected each long term care facility to a different degree depending upon the amount of revenue it derives from medicare patients 
long term care facilities have had to attempt to restructure their operations to operate profitably under the new medicare pps reimbursement policies 
in addition  private payors  including managed care payers  are increasingly demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk of operating a healthcare facility 
efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls are expected to continue 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement levels could adversely affect revenues of the company s lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees and borrowers abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to the company 
the possibility that the healthcare facilities will not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses or will yield returns lower than those available through investments in comparable real estate or other investments are additional risks of investing in healthcare related real estate 
income from properties and yields from investments in such properties may be affected by many factors  including changes in governmental regulation such as zoning laws  general or local economic conditions such as fluctuations in interest rates and employment conditions  the available local supply and demand for improved real estate  a reduction in rental income as the result of an inability to maintain occupancy levels  natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods or similar factors 
data taken from aon florida long term care general liability and professional liability actuarial analysis  february  real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit the ability of the company to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
the company s properties are special purpose properties that could not be readily converted to general residential  retail or office use 
healthcare facilities that participate in medicare and or medicaid programs must meet extensive program requirements  including physical plant and operational requirements  which are revised from time to time 
such requirements may include a duty to admit medicare and medicaid patients  thereby limiting the ability of the facility to increase its private pay census beyond certain limits 
medicare and medicaid facilities are regularly inspected to determine compliance and may be excluded from the programs in some cases without a prior hearing for failure to meet program requirements 
transfers of nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities between operators are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate 
thus  if the operation of any of the company s properties becomes unprofitable due to competition  age of improvements or other factors such that the lessee or borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the lease or mortgage loan  the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less  particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan  than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses 
other changes in the healthcare industry include continuing trends toward shorter lengths of stay  increased use of outpatient services  increased federal  state and third party regulation and oversight of healthcare company operations and business practices and increased demand for capitated healthcare services delivery of services at a fixed price per capita basis to a defined group of covered parties 
the entrance of insurance companies into managed care programs is also accelerating the introduction of managed care in new localities  and states and insurance companies continue to negotiate actively the amounts they will pay for services 
moreover  the percentage of healthcare services that are reimbursed under medicare and medicaid programs continues to increase as the population ages and as states expand their medicaid programs 
continued eligibility to participate in these programs is crucial to a provider s financial strength 
finally  healthcare regulation through certificates of need con has tended to limit construction of new long term care facilities in many states 
several states in which the company has investments have repealed con legislation  including california and texas  opening up opportunities for additional competition for the company s facilities 
as a result of the foregoing  the revenues and margins of the operators of the company s facilities may decrease  resulting in a reduction of the company s rent interest coverage from investments 
potential risks from bankruptcies 
generally  the company s lease arrangements with a single operator who operates more than one of the company s facilities is designed pursuant to a single master lease a master lease or collectively  the master leases 
although each lease or master lease provides that the company may terminate the master lease upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the tenant  the bankruptcy reform act of bankruptcy code provides that a trustee in a bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding under the bankruptcy code or debtor in possession in a reorganization under the bankruptcy code has the power and the option to assume or reject the unexpired lease obligations of a debtor lessee 
in the event that the unexpired lease is assumed on behalf of the debtor lessee  all the rental obligations thereunder generally would be entitled to a priority over other unsecured claims 
however  the court also has the power to modify a lease if a debtor lessee in a reorganization were required to perform certain provisions of a lease that the court determined to be unduly burdensome 
it is not possible at this time to determine whether or not a court would hold that any lease or master lease contains any such provisions 
if a lease is rejected  the lessor has a general unsecured claim limited to any unpaid rent already due plus an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease  without acceleration  for the greater of one year or of the remaining term of such lease  not to exceed the rent obligation for three years 
generally  with respect to the company s mortgage loans  the imposition of an automatic stay under the bankruptcy code precludes the company from exercising foreclosure or other remedies against the debtor 
a mortgagee also is treated differently from a landlord in three key respects 
first  the mortgage loan is not subject to assumption or rejection because it is not an executory contract or a lease 
second  the mortgagee s loan may be divided into a secured loan for the portion of the mortgage debt that does not exceed the value of the property and a general unsecured loan for the portion of the mortgage debt that exceeds the value of the property 
a secured creditor such as the company is entitled to the recovery of interest and costs only if and to the extent that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed 
if the value of the collateral is less than the debt  a lender such as the company would not receive or be entitled to any interest for the time period between the filing of the case and confirmation 
if the value of the collateral does exceed the debt  interest and allowed costs may not be paid during the bankruptcy proceeding but accrue until confirmation of a plan or reorganization or some other time as the court orders 
finally  while a lease generally would either be rejected or assumed with all of its benefits and burdens intact  the terms of a mortgage  including the rate of interest and timing of principal payments  may be modified if the debtor is able to effect a cramdown under the bankruptcy code 
the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
in order to protect its investments  the company may take possession of a property or even become licensed as an operator  which might expose the company to successorship liability to government programs or require the company to indemnify subsequent operators to whom it might transfer the operating rights and licenses 
third party payors may also suspend payments to the company following foreclosure until the company receives the required licenses to operate the facilities 
should such events occur  the company s income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 
see note mortgage notes receivable and note concentration of risk  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
risks related to owned and operated assets 
as a consequence of the financial difficulties encountered by a number of the company s operators  the company has recovered various long term care assets  pledged as collateral for the operators obligations  either in connection with a restructuring or settlement with certain operators or pursuant to foreclosure proceedings 
under normal circumstances  the company would classify such assets as assets held for sale and seek to re lease or otherwise dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable 
however  a number of companies are actively marketing portfolios of similar assets and  in light of the current conditions in the long term care industry generally  it has become more difficult both to sell such properties and for potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire such properties 
during  million of assets previously classified as held for sale were reclassified to owned and operated assets as the timing and strategy for sale or  alternatively  re leasing  were revised in light of prevailing market conditions 
the company is typically required to hold applicable leases and is responsible for the regulatory compliance at its owned and operated facilities 
the company s management contracts with third party operators for such properties provide that the third party operator is responsible for regulatory compliance  but the company could be sanctioned for violation of regulatory requirements 
in addition  the risk of third party claims such as patient care and personal injury claims may be higher with respect to company owned and operated properties as compared to the company s leased and mortgaged assets 
competition 
the company competes for additional healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other real estate investment trusts 
the operators of the facilities compete with other regional or local nursing care facilities for the support of the medical community  including physicians and acute care hospitals  as well as the general public 
some significant competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care nursing facilities include quality of care  reputation  physical appearance of the facilities  services offered  family preferences  physician services and price 
federal income tax considerations 
at all times  the company intends to make and manage its investments including the sale or disposition of property or other investments and to operate in such a manner as to be consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code or regulations thereunder to qualify as a reit  unless  because of changes in circumstances or changes in the code or regulations thereunder  the board of directors determines that it is no longer in the best interest of the company to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  the company generally will not pay federal income taxes on the portion of its income which is distributed to shareholders  although income earned from foreclosure property the owned and operated assets  after deducting depreciation expense  is subject to corporate level taxation

overview the long term care industry has experienced unprecedented financial challenges in the recent past that have had an adverse impact on the company during these challenges are due principally to the introduction in of pps for the reimbursement of skilled nursing facilities  implementing an acuity based reimbursement system in lieu of the cost based reimbursement system historically used 
the effect of pps was to significantly reduce payments to nursing home operators  that reduction  in turn  has negatively affected the revenues of the company s nursing home facilities and the ability of the company s nursing home operators to service their capital costs to the company 
these current challenges have forced many nursing home operators in america into financial distress 
a number of the company s large nursing home operators ultimately sought protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code  including allegheny health systems in  sun healthcare group and frontier group  inc in  and integrated health services  raintree healthcare corp 
and mariner post acute network  inc in another operator  advocat  inc  suspended payment of rent to the company during the first quarter of  reinstated partial payments in april  and negotiated a restructuring arrangement with the company in november these developments negatively affected the company s financial results and the company s access to capital sources to fund growth as well as refinance existing indebtedness 
to obtain sufficient liquidity to enable the company to address the maturity in july and february of indebtedness totaling million  the company issued million of series c preferred stock to explorer holdings  lp in july  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements shareholders equity and stock options 
simultaneously with the issuance of the series c preferred  the company also refinanced its existing credit facilities 
as a consequence of the financial difficulties encountered by a number of the company s operators  the company has recovered various long term care assets pledged as collateral for the operators obligations either in connection with a restructuring or settlement with certain operators or pursuant to foreclosure proceedings 
under normal circumstances  the company would classify such assets as assets held for sale and seek to re lease or otherwise dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable 
however  a number of companies are actively marketing portfolios of similar assets and  in light of the current conditions in the long term care industry generally  it has become more difficult both to sell such properties and for potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire such properties

in light of the maturity in february of million of subordinated debentures  explorer agreed to allow the company to defer payment until april  of million of dividends on explorer s series c preferred declared in october in exchange for this deferral  the company agreed to pay explorer a waiver fee equal to per annum of the unpaid dividend amount from november  until the october dividend is paid 
on march  in consideration of prevailing conditions in the long term care industry and the capital markets generally  the company exercised its option under the dividend deferral agreement to pay the deferred dividend and related waiver fee by issuing  additional shares of series c preferred which are convertible into  shares of omega common stock at per share 
on february   the company announced the suspension of all common and preferred dividends 
this action together with the election by the company to pay the deferred series c dividend and related waiver in additional shares of series c is intended to preserve cash to facilitate the company s ability to obtain financing to fund the debt maturities 
the company anticipates that it will reinstate dividends on its common and preferred stock when the company determines that it has sufficient resources or satisfactory plans to meet its debt maturities  but the company can give no assurance as to when the dividends will be reinstated or the amount of the dividends if and when such payments are recommenced 
prior to recommencing the payment of dividends on the company s common stock  all accrued and unpaid dividends on the company s series a  b and c preferred stock must be paid in full 
the company has made sufficient distributions to satisfy the distribution requirements under the reit rules to maintain its reit status for and intends to satisfy such requirements under the reit rules for management believes the company s liquidity and various sources of available capital are adequate to finance operations  meet debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next months but is taking immediate steps  including the announced suspension of dividends and the pursuit of capital sources for repayment or replacement of the debt maturities 
as a result of the ongoing financial challenges facing long term care operators  the availability of the external capital sources historically used by the company has become extremely limited and expensive  and  therefore  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to replace or extend the debt maturities  or that any refinancing or replacement financing would be on favorable terms to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain refinancing or replacement financing  it may be required to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum recovery on such investments 
this could also result in adverse tax consequences to the company see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but the company seeks to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the market value of the company s long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages are subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term borrowings at december  was million 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the company s total mortgages portfolio at december  was million 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the mortgage portfolio by approximately million 
the company is subject to risks associated with debt or preferred equity financing  including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness 
if the company were unable to refinance its debt maturities or other indebtedness on acceptable terms  it might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to the company and might adversely affect the cash available for distribution to shareholders  or to pursue dilutive equity financing 
if interest rates or other factors at the time of the refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the company s interest expense would increase  which might affect the company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders 
the company utilizes interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
at december   the company had interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million and million  based on day london interbank offered rates libor

the amounts exchanged are based on the notional amounts 
the million agreement expires on december  but may be extended for an additional year by the counterparty
