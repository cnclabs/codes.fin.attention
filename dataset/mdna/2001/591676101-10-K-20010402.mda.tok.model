euro conversion 
on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro traded on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  the countries that adopted the euro on january  are austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  and spain 
during the transition period  non cash payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or legacy currency 
between january  and january  the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border transparency 
the company is assessing its pricing marketing strategy in order to insure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
the company is also assessing its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies  and is reviewing whether certain existing contracts will need to be modified 
the company s currency risk and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands market risk sensitive instruments 
the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
interest rate risk 
the company s bank loans expose earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are either variable or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable 
the fair values of the company s bank loans are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
the change in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates is not material 
foreign exchange risk 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  namely the euro  thereby mitigating the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
principal transactions hedged are intercompany sales and payments 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the company s statement of operations 
a large percentage of the company s foreign sales are transacted in foreign local currencies 
as a result  the company s international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical five percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the euro could have had an impact of on the net earnings of the company 
actual results may differ 
the company is subject to risk from fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar for its european subsidiary  which uses the euro as their functional currency and translated into us dollars in consolidation 
such changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in other comprehensive income loss 
at december   the company had translation exposure 
the potential effect on other comprehensive income loss resulting from a hypothetical change in the quoted euro rate amounts to actual results may differ 
in addition  the company holds debt denominated in euros and recognizes foreign currency translation adjustments in net income 
the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the quoted euro rate is approximately actual results may differ
