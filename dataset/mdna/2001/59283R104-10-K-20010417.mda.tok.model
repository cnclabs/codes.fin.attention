as a result of this exercise  it was determined that certain assets were impaired and the company expensed million related to restaurant closure and asset impairment costs 
infrequently occurring income and expense consisted of two items that increased operating income in the aggregate by  the company sold one restaurant to the state of texas by eminent domain for  resulting in a gain of  as part of the company s decision to consolidate with a single outsourcing firm its accounting process  the company settled its old outsourcing contract for  other income expense 
net other expense increased basis points to compared with in fiscal income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the higher rate is due to the effect of permanent tax differences on lower income before taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company met fiscal capital requirements with cash generated by operations 
in fiscal  the company s operations generated approximately million in cash  as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of approximately million  compared with a working capital deficit of approximately million at january  a working capital deficit is common in the restaurant industry  since restaurant companies do not typically require a significant investment in either accounts receivable or inventory 
the company s principal capital requirements are the funding of new restaurant development or acquisitions and remodeling of older units 
during fiscal  capital expenditures on property  plant and equipment were approximately million as compared to approximately million for fiscal the company opened one new restaurant  reopened an existing restaurant a conversion from a casa ole to a tortuga coastal cantina and remodeled four restaurants 
there are no new restaurants planned for fiscal the company does plan to modestly remodel five restaurants in fiscal year the estimated capital needed for fiscal for general corporate purposes  including remodeling  is approximately million 
this estimate also includes five remodels  ranging from  to  per restaurant 
the company has a million credit facility with bank of america 
at december   the credit facility will be reduced to million and will mature on july  the interest rate is either the prime rate or libor plus a stipulated percentage 
accordingly  the company is impacted by changes in the prime rate and libor 
the company is subject to a non use fee ranging from to on the unused portion of the revolver from the date of the credit agreement 
as of december   the company had million outstanding on the revolving line of credit 
the acquisition of la senorita  which closed on april   used million of the revolving line 
the balance was used for new restaurant construction  remodeling and other working capital needs 
bank of america notified the company in early february that it was asking the company to find a replacement lender 
they also indicated that to facilitate the effort they were moving the company s account to the bank s special assets group 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of its loan covenants 
however  based on tighter covenants that go into effect in the first quarter of fiscal  the company anticipates it maybe out of compliance with certain loan covenants at the end of the first and second quarters of fiscal the bank  in return for additional fees and an increase in interest rates  has agreed to waive the first and second quarter lack of compliance and amended certain future covenant ratios under the debt agreement 
the company has received and is evaluating alternative finance proposals from several lenders 
the goal is to enter into a term loan for at least million  and to establish a new revolving line of credit 
without property sales  the company anticipates that it will use excess cash flow during fiscal to pay down approximately million of outstanding indebtedness 
the company also has a million forward commitment agreement with franchise finance corporation of america ffca 
at december   the company had approximately million available under the ffca forward commitments 
the company s management believes that with its forward commitments with franchise finance corporation of america  along with operating cash flow and the company s revolving line of credit with bank of america and its successor  funds will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and to finance routine capital expenditures and remodels through the end of the fiscal year 
risk factors the company cautions readers that its business is subject to a number of risks  any of which could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made from time to time in releases  including this form k  and oral statements 
certain risk factors have been presented throughout this document  including  among others  expansion strategy  site selection  attracting and retaining franchisees  managers and other employees  availability of food products  competition and government regulation 
certain other risks to which the company is subject include seasonality 
the company s sales and earnings fluctuate seasonally 
historically the company s highest sales and earnings have occurred in the third and fourth calendar quarters  which the company believes is typical of the restaurant industry and consumer spending patterns in general with respect to the third quarter and is due to increased holiday traffic at the company s mall restaurants for the fourth quarter 
in addition  quarterly results have been and  in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any calendar quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
impact of inflation market risks 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
if operating expenses increase  management intends to attempt to recover increased costs by increasing prices to the extent deemed advisable considering competitive conditions 
the company does not have or participate in transactions involving derivative  financial and commodity instruments 
accelerating growth strategy 
the company s ability to expand by adding company owned and franchised restaurants and acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable locations  the ability to hire  train and retain an adequate number of experienced management and hourly employees  the availability of acceptable lease terms and adequate financing  timely construction of restaurants  the ability to obtain various government permits and licenses and other factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company and its franchisees 
the opening of additional franchised restaurants will depend  in part  upon the ability of existing and future franchisees to obtain financing or investment capital adequate to meet their market development obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to open the number of restaurants it currently plans to open or that new restaurants can be operated profitably 
expansion into new geographic markets in which the company has no operating experiences and in which mexican and tex mex food restaurants are less prevalent than in texas has an inherent risk 
consumer tastes vary from region to region in the united states  and there can be no assurance that customers located in the regions of the united states into which the company intends to expand will be as receptive to mexican and tex mex food as those customers in its existing markets 
there can be no assurance as to the success of the company s efforts to expand into other geographic regions or that the cost of such efforts will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
small restaurant base and geographic concentration 
the results achieved to date by the company s relatively small restaurant base may not be indicative of the results of a larger number of restaurants in a more geographically dispersed area 
because of the company s relatively small restaurant base  an unsuccessful new restaurant could have a more significant effect on the company s results of operations than would be the case in a company owning more restaurants 
additionally  given the company s present geographic concentration all company owned units are currently in texas  oklahoma  michigan and idaho  results of operations may be adversely affected by economic or other conditions in the region and adverse publicity relating to the company s restaurants could have a more pronounced adverse effect on the company s overall sales than might be the case if the company s restaurants were more broadly dispersed

forehand  david nierenberg  michael d 
domec and louis p 
neeb  directors and or executive officers of the company 
shares eligible for future sale and stock price

forehand to louis p 
neeb  tex mex partners  lc and a former officer of the company to register the  underlying shares of common stock covered by such warrants in connection with registrations otherwise undertaken by the company 
in any event  the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to the company s operating results and other factors 
competition 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive 
the company competes against other family dining concepts  as well as quick service and casual dining concepts  for customers  employees  and franchisees 
see item business competition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have or participate in transactions involving derivative  financial and commodity instruments 
the company s long term debt bears interest at floating market rates 
based on amounts outstanding at year end  a change in interest rates would change interest expense by approximately
