item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of lasersight s consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and lasersight s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
all references to years are to lasersight s fiscal years ended december   and  unless otherwise indicated 
overview lasersight s net loss and loss attributable to common shareholders for was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  while the net loss and loss attributable to common shareholders for was  or per basic and diluted common share  on net sales of  the net losses are primarily attributable to the expenses generated by our technology segment 
lasersight is principally engaged in the manufacture and supply of microspot scanning excimer laser systems  keratomes  keratome blades and other related products used to perform procedures that correct common refractive vision disorders such as nearsightedness  farsightedness and astigmatism 
since  we have marketed our laser systems commercially in over countries worldwide and currently have an installed base of over scanning laser systems outside the us  including approximately of our laserscan lsx laser systems 
in november  we received fda approval for commercialization of our laserscan lsx laser systems in the us  and shipments of that product in the us began in march our microshape family of keratome products includes our ultrashaper durable keratome  unishaper single use keratome  a control console that may be used interchangeably with our single use and durable keratomes  and our ultraedge keratome blades 
we began commercial shipment of keratome blades in july and of our single use keratomes in december we currently expect to begin commercial shipments of our ultrashaper durable keratomes during the second quarter of  and anticipate that both of these products will provide us with the opportunity to participate in the significant growth in refractive laser vision correction procedure volume by generating recurring revenue streams as a result of these significant developments  our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
in particular  we anticipate that our laserscan lsx laser system will make a more significant contribution to our future operating results as a result of the anticipated increased shipments of these laser systems to us customers after we receive fda approval for treatment of myopia with astigmatism 
in addition  we expect to commercially launch our ultrashaper durable keratome in the second quarter of  which we also expect to contribute to our future operating results 
however  we expect to continue to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow at least through the first half of we also license to other participants in the excimer laser industry various patents held by lasersight related to the use of excimer lasers to ablate biological tissue  and provide health care and vision care consulting services to hospitals  managed care companies and physicians

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million in during the year ended december   refractive products revenues increased million  or  to million from million in this revenue increase was primarily the result of increased sales of the laserscan lsx due to our ability to sell laser systems in the us  the higher price of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system and the introduction of our blade and keratome related products 
see risk factors and uncertainties industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
during the year ended december   excimer laser system sales accounted for approximately million in revenues compared to million in during the years ended december  and  respectively  laserscan lsx system sales accounted for substantially all excimer laser system sales 
during the year ended december   laser systems were sold  compared to laser system sales in of the laser systems sold in  were discounted sales to existing customers compared to laser systems sold that included discounted sales to existing customers in net revenues from patent services for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million from million in  due to increased licensing fees 
net revenues from health care services for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million from million in this increase primarily resulted from additional consulting services provided  partially attributable to the two senior level consultants added during the third quarter of cost of revenue  gross profits 
for the years ended december  and  gross profit margins were and  respectively 
the gross margin increase during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to increased sales of the laserscan lsx excimer laser system and higher patent and health care services revenues 
these increased sales were partially offset by higher raw material costs relating to the laserscan lsx excimer laser system and an increase in our inventory obsolescence reserve of million 
this additional reserve primarily relates to a write down of our aesthetic inventory  consisting mainly of erbium lasers used for skin resurfacing 
this product line is not part of our focus on refractive products 
research  development and regulatory expense 
research  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in we continued to develop our keratome systems  excimer laser systems and continued to pursue expanded fda approvals for our refractive products 
as a result of a continuation of these efforts plus the development of new technologies like our astramax diagnostic workstation  we expect research and development expenses during to approximate the levels incurred during regulatory expenses are expected to remain constant as a result of our continued pursuit of fda approvals  protocols added during related to the potential use of our laser systems for treatments utilizing the lasik procedure  pre market approval supplements added during and the possible development of additional pre market approval supplements and future protocols for submission to the fda 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to an increase in expenses incurred at our refractive products subsidiary of approximately million over these included enhancements primarily to the customer support and training  sales and marketing departments  including the establishment of a us sales department  of million  the establishment of our european operation of million  higher depreciation costs of million and million of legal fees related to patent issues and litigation 
see risk factors and uncertainties financial and liquidity risks if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms 
selling related expenses 
selling related expenses consist of those items directly related to sales activities  including commissions on sales  royalty or license fees  warranty expenses  and costs of shipping and installation 
commissions and royalties  in particular  can vary significantly from sale to sale or period to period depending on the location and terms of each sale 
selling related expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in sales commissions resulting from increased laser system sales  an increase of million in license fees primarily resulting from the introduction of our keratome products and an increase of million of warranty expense primarily related to increased laser system sales 
during the last six months of  million of keratome related royalties resulted from minimum royalty obligations 
see risk factors and uncertainties company and business risks required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   costs relating to the amortization of intangible assets was million  approximately the same as in items directly related to the amortization of intangible assets are acquired technologies  patents  license agreements and goodwill 
impairment loss 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million related to goodwill of our lasersight centers subsidiary 
the combination of increased price competition and resulting losses in many other laser centers businesses during and our increased focus on refractive product development and commercialization resulted in management s decision in late to abandon the strategy of a mobile laser business 
as a result  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of such goodwill  and concluded that a significant impairment of intangible assets had occurred 
an impairment charge was required because the carrying value of the assets could not be recovered through estimated net cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we also recorded an impairment loss of approximately million related to the pma application acquired in in december  we submitted to the fda our own pma supplement representing data from clinical trials performed on our lsx laser system  an advantage over the pma application acquired in in addition  the fda has audited and approved our manufacturing operation for the lsx laser system 
this december submission resulted in management s decision to abandon further efforts related to the pma application acquired in as a result  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of such intangible asset  and concluded that a significant impairment of it had occurred 
an impairment charge was required because the carrying value of the assets could not be recovered through estimated net cash flows 
loss from operations 
the operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to the operating loss of million in this increase in the loss from operations was primarily due to the increase in sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system and an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary  more than offset by an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to our refractive products operations as well as impairment loss of million 
other income and expense 
interest and dividend income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million over the comparable period in interest and dividend income was earned from the investment of cash and cash equivalents and the collection of long term receivables related to laser system sales 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was not material 
income taxes 
for the years ended december  and  lasersight had no income tax expense as a result of net losses 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million in the increase in net loss for the year ended december  can be attributed to the increase in sales of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system and an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary  more than offset by an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to our refractive products operations as well as an impairment loss of million 
loss per share 
the loss per basic and diluted share was for the year ended december  and in during the year ended december   the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding increased primarily due to the conversion of preferred stock  private placements of common stock and the exercise of options and warrants 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in during the year ended december   refractive products revenues increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this revenue increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our higher priced laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
during the year ended december   excimer laser system sales accounted for approximately million in revenues compared to million in revenues over the same period in during the year ended december  and  respectively  laserscan lsx system sales accounted for and  respectively  of total excimer laser system sales 
during the year ended december   laser systems were sold compared to system sales over the comparable period in the systems sold during include system sales to new customers and laserscan lsx excimer laser systems sold to existing customers to replace older laser systems 
the replacement systems were sold at discounted prices at a positive gross margin  though at a lower gross margin than sales to new customers 
additional improvements in refractive products related revenues during the year ended december  were attributable to an increase in the level of service contract revenues and increased revenues generated from our aesthetic product line  that was acquired in april these increases were slightly offset by a reduction in revenues generated from miscellaneous part sales for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues from patent services for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in  due to increased licensing fees 
net revenues from health care services for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or to million from million for the comparable period in this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in consulting services provided and was accompanied by a reduction in expenses of approximately million over the year ended december  such revenue and expense reductions are primarily the result of staffing reductions instituted during mid to more closely match the cost structure of this segment with anticipated revenues going forward 
cost of revenues  gross profits 
for the years ended december  and  gross profit margins were and  respectively 
the gross profit margin decrease during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to higher raw material costs relating to the laserscan lsx excimer laser system of million  an increase in manufacturing overhead of million  an increase in our inventory obsolescence reserve of million  and an increase of million in raw materials relating to our aesthetics division  that was acquired in april research  development and regulatory expenses 
research  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in we continued to develop our keratome systems  excimer laser systems and continued to pursue protocols in our effort to attain fda approval for our products 
as a result of a continuation of these efforts plus the anticipated development of new product concepts  we expect research and development expenses during to increase over levels incurred during regulatory expenses are expected to increase as a result of our continued pursuit of fda approval for our pma supplements  protocols added during related to the potential use of our laser systems for treatments utilizing lasik procedures and the possible development of additional pre market approval supplements and future protocols for submission to the fda 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in this increase was due to an increase in expenses related to our refractive products business of approximately million over the comparable period in these included enhancements to the customer support and training  quality assurance  marketing  software development and engineering departments of million  million of costs relating to our efforts to develop a blade manufacturing operation  million of higher depreciation and lease costs including the second winter park  florida facility and larger office space  million of salaries primarily resulting from staffing additions to accounting  information systems and human resources departments and bad debt expense of million  which represented a general increase in reserves 
see risk factors financial and liquidity risks if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms 
the total increase was partially offset by a million reduction of expenses related to our patent services business from the comparable period in selling related expenses 
selling related expenses consist of those items directly related to sales activities  including commissions on sales  royalty or license fees  warranty expenses  and costs of shipping and installation 
commissions and royalties  in particular  can vary significantly from sale to sale or period to period depending on the location and terms of each sale 
selling related expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million during the comparable period in this increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in estimated warranty expense being accrued resulting from higher sales and an increase in the per system estimate to provide annual warranty coverage from the comparable period  partially offset by a million decrease in sales commissions  which vary depending on the location of sale 
there were no material changes in the levels of royalty fees  system installation and shipping costs in the comparable periods 
amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   costs relating to the amortization of intangible assets increased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in items directly related to the amortization of intangible assets are acquired technologies  patents  license agreements and goodwill 
loss from operations 
the operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to the operating loss of million for the same period in this increase in the loss from operations was primarily due to the increase in other general and administrative expenses related to the sale of our refractive products and the decrease in our gross profit margin  partially offset by an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary 
other income and expense 
interest and dividend income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period in interest and dividend income was earned from the investment of cash and cash equivalents and the collection of long term receivables related to laser system sales 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to interest expense of million for the comparable period in interest expense incurred during the year ended december  related primarily to an adjustment to the fair value of the warrant issued to foothill capital corporation and interest paid on a capital lease obligation during the first half of interest expense incurred during the year ended december  related primarily to the credit facility established with foothill on april  that was repaid in full in june in addition to interest paid on the outstanding note payable balance  interest expense in included the amortization of deferred financing costs  the accretion of the discount on the note payable  and fees associated with amendments to the original loan agreement 
during the year ended december   lasersight recognized gains on the sale of subsidiaries and securities of million resulting from the sale of marketable equity securities that were received in december in exchange for the sale of two health care subsidiaries 
income taxes 
for the year ended december   lasersight had no income tax expense  while income tax expense of million was recognized during the year ended december  net loss 
net loss for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million for the comparable period in the increase in net loss for the year ended december  can be attributed to the increase in other general and administrative expenses incurred by our refractive products operations and the decrease in our gross profit margin  partially offset by an improvement in the operating gain generated by our patent services subsidiary 
loss attributable to common shareholders 
the loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was impacted by the million premium paid on the repurchase of the remaining shares of series b preferred stock  the accretion of million of financing costs related to such shares  the million value of the conversion discount on the series c preferred stock and series d preferred stock  the impact of the million premium paid on the first quarter repurchase of shares of series b preferred stock and the accretion of million of financing costs related to such shares 
the comparable period in was not impacted by any such adjustments 
loss per share 
the loss per basic and diluted share decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in of the basic and diluted losses per share for the year ended december   was a result of the value of the conversion discount on preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d and accretion and dividend requirements on the series b preferred stock 
during the year ended december   the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding increased primarily due to the exercise of options and warrants and the private placement completed in march liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds have historically been from sales of preferred stock and common stock  sales of subsidiaries and patent rights and  to a lesser extent  our operating cash flows 
we issued securities totaling approximately million in  million in  million in  and million in  and received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of approximately  in  million in  million in and  in in addition  we sold subsidiaries and various patent rights  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million in  million in and million to date in we have principally used these capital resources to fund operating losses  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and retirement of debt 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in march  we completed the sale of the blum patent for a cash payment of million 
we retained a non exclusive royalty free license under the patent  which relates to the use of ultraviolet light for the removal of organic tissue 
our book value of the patent at december   was approximately million 
on march   we established a million term loan and million revolving credit facility with heller 
we borrowed million under the term loan at a rate per annum equal to two and one half percent above the prime rate 
interest is payable monthly and the loan must be repaid on march  under the credit agreement  we have the option to borrow amounts at a rate per annum equal to one and one quarter percent above the prime rate for short term working capital needs or such other purposes as may be approved by heller 
borrowings are limited to of qualified accounts receivable related to us sales 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the term and credit facility require us to maintain a minimum net worth 
the terms of the loans extend to march  in addition to the costs and fees associated with the transaction  we issued to heller a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
the warrant expires on march  the credit facility replaces a million credit facility that was entered into in september at march   we had no borrowings under the credit facility 
our working capital decreased million from million at december  to million as of december  this decrease in working capital resulted primarily from the private placements of common stock in january  february and september and other equity transactions  which resulted in gross proceeds of million  offset primarily by our loss before depreciation  amortization and impairment losses of million and our acquisition of property and intangible assets for million 
operating activities used net cash of million during  compared to million during we expect to incur a loss and a deficit in cash flow from operations for the first half of there can be no assurance that we can regain or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow in any subsequent fiscal period 
net cash used in investing activities of million during can be attributed primarily to the purchase of patents and property and equipment 
as of december   we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
net cash provided from financing activities during of million resulted primarily from the issuance of  shares of common stock in private placements to five investors for gross proceeds of million including million from tlc 
we are currently exploring opportunities for additional equity financing through a private placement of our common stock 
we believe that  in addition to our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operations  some form of equity or debt financing may be necessary to fund our anticipated working capital requirements for the next months in accordance with our current business plan 
our belief regarding future working capital requirements is based on various factors and assumptions including the growth in laser sales resulting from our entrance into the us market in march with corresponding increases in accounts receivable and inventory purchases to date  the uncertain timing of astigmatism and other supplemental fda approvals for our laserscan lsx excimer laser system  that could continue to impact our sales during  the uncertain timing of the market introduction of our ultrashaper durable keratomes  commercial acceptance of our ultraedge keratome blades and unishaper single use keratomes  which we believe is partially dependent upon the successful introduction of the ultrashaper  the anticipated timely collection of receivables  and the absence of unanticipated product development and marketing costs 
see risk factors and uncertainties industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
similarly  our long term liquidity will be dependent on the successful entrance into the us market with our laser systems  the successful entrance into us and international markets of our diagnostic workstation and keratome products  and our ability to collect our receivables on a timely basis 
we may seek additional debt or equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
other than the million term loan and million credit facility completed in march with heller  we currently do not have any commitments for additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we can obtain financing that we believe will be necessary to finance our working capital requirements for the next months 
see risk factors and uncertainties financial and liquidity risks we could require additional financing which might not be available if we need it 
seasonality  backlog and customer payment terms based on our historical activity  we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations have a material impact on our financial performance 
to date  we have been able to ship laser units as orders are received 
as a result  order backlog is not a meaningful factor in our business 
in the us  we expect that sales of our laser systems will generally be to customers with approved credit  and we anticipate that the purchase price for such laser systems will generally be paid to us within days of shipment 
in international markets  unless a letter of credit or other acceptable security has been obtained  we generally require a down payment or deposit from our laser system customers at or before installation 
at december   we were the payee on letters of credit with foreign financial institutions aggregating approximately million compared to approximately million at december  
on occasion  it is necessary to meet a competitor s more liberal terms of payment 
in those and other cases  we may provide term financing 
our internally financed sales with repayment periods exceeding months measured from the installation date decreased from systems in  to five systems in and consisted of systems during in our experience  sales of major capital equipment such as excimer laser systems in certain areas  including much of south and central america  often require payment terms ranging from to months 
risk factors and uncertainties the business  results of operations and financial condition of lasersight and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including the ones noted below industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our laserscan lsx laser system will achieve market acceptance in the us  and our business model for selling our laser system in the us is new and unproven 
we received the fda approval necessary for the commercial marketing and sale of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us in late and commercial shipments to customers in the us began in march our previous experience marketing and selling our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us had been limited to cost recovery sales to refractive surgeons participating in our fda clinical trials 
the required level of per procedure fees payable to us by refractive surgeons upon receipt of anticipated fda approval for treatment of myopia with astigmatism may not be accepted by the marketplace or may exceed those charged by our competitors 
while we believe that gaining access to our recently approved scanning microspot laser technology justifies the required per procedure fee levels  we cannot assure you that this business model will be accepted by a large number of refractive surgeons 
if our competitors reduce or do not charge per procedure fees to users of their systems  we could be forced to reduce or eliminate the fees charged under this business model  which could significantly reduce our revenues 
for example  nidek co  ltd  one of our competitors  has publicly stated that it will not charge per procedure fees to users of its laser systems in the us and internationally 
successful implementation of this business model is crucial to our success in selling our laserscan lsx laser system in the us and may require the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness of the laserscan lsx laser system and create demand by refractive surgeons 
if our laser system fails to achieve market acceptance in the us  we may not be able to execute our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
keratomes are surgical devices used to create a corneal flap immediately prior to lasik laser vision correction procedures 
we began to roll out our microshape family of keratome products with the commercial launch of our ultraedge keratome blades in july and of our unishaper single use keratomes and control consoles in december we anticipate the commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratomes during the second quarter of we had previously estimated the launch of this product during the second quarter of we cannot assure you that there will not be further unanticipated delays in the launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome  which has continued a process of engineering refinement and validity testing prior to commercial release 
our unishaper single use keratome was the first disposable keratome product to be commercially marketed  and we cannot assure you that refractive surgeons  including in particular refractive surgeons who perform a large volume of lasik procedures  will accept our unishaper product as either a replacement for or a supplement to the durable keratomes traditionally used to create corneal flaps 
in our recent experience  many surgeons are reluctant to use a disposable keratome product as their primary keratome 
also  market acceptance of the unishaper may be hindered by surgeons needing to alter their surgical technique in order to achieve the desired clinical results 
our ultrashaper durable keratome incorporates the features found in the automated corneal shaper keratome previously marketed by bausch lomb  inc with new enhancements and features 
however  bausch lomb has not aggressively marketed or serviced the acs since when we licensed the rights to commercially market keratomes based on the same technology  and has successfully transitioned a large number of refractive surgeons from the acs to its hansatome durable keratome product 
we believe that many refractive surgeons learned to perform the lasik procedure using the acs and prefer the surgical technique required by the acs  which is also used to operate our ultrashaper durable keratome  to the surgical technique required to operate the hansatome keratome product 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in commercially introducing or achieving broad market acceptance of our ultrashaper durable keratome or our other keratome products 
we have previously indicated that the successful implementation of our keratome product sales strategy is in part dependent upon our marketing and distribution alliance with becton dickinson 
due to the delay in the commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome we initiated discussions with becton dickinson in order to modify our manufacturing and marketing agreements 
while these discussions were ongoing we recently received notices from becton dickinson claiming that they have the right to end our marketing arrangement in six months and that they are not bound by the terms of our manufacturing agreement 
following our receipt of these notices becton dickinson indicated a willingness to discuss modified terms for a marketing and manufacturing relationship 
while we do not agree that becton dickinson has the right to unilaterally end our current agreements we intend to discuss mutually beneficial modified agreements 
if we cannot successfully market and sell our keratome products or if we are unable to successfully modify or replace our marketing and distribution alliance with becton dickinson  we may not be able to execute our business plan  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see also company and business risks required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
the vision correction industry currently consists of a few established providers with significant market shares and we may encounter difficulties competing in this highly competitive environment 
the vision correction industry is subject to intense  increasing competition  and we do not know if we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
many of our competitors have established products  distribution capabilities and customer service networks in the us marketplace  are substantially larger and have greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources than we do 
visx incorporated  the historical industry leader for excimer laser system sales in the us  sold laser systems that performed a significant majority of the laser vision correction procedures performed in the us in and similarly  bausch lomb sold a significant majority of the keratomes used by refractive surgeons in the us in and in  alcon acquired summit autonomous inc the merger resulted in a combined entity with enhanced market presence  technology base and distribution capabilities and provided summit with a narrow beam laser technology platform which will compete more directly with our precision beam scanning microspot laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition  the combined entity will be able to sell narrow beam laser systems under a royalty free license to certain visx patents without incurring the expense and uncertainty associated with intellectual property litigation with visx 
we anticipate that alcon will leverage the sale of its laser systems with its other ophthalmic products 
many of our competitors received earlier regulatory approvals than us and may have a competitive advantage over us due to the subsequent expansion of their regulatory approvals and their substantial experience in the us market 
we received the fda approval necessary for the commercial sale of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system in the us in november  and commercial shipments to customers in the us began in march our direct competitors include large corporations such as visx and alcon  each of whom received fda approval of excimer laser systems more than three years ago and has substantial experience manufacturing  marketing and servicing laser systems in the us in addition to visx and alcon  nidek and bausch lomb have also received fda approval for their laser systems 
in the us  a manufacturer of excimer laser vision correction systems gains a competitive advantage by having its systems approved by the fda for a wider range of treatments 
initial fda approvals of excimer laser vision correction systems historically have been limited to prk treatment of low to moderate nearsightedness  with additional approvals for other and broader treatments granted only as a result of subsequent fda applications and clinical trials 
our laserscan lsx is currently approved only for the prk treatment of low to moderate nearsightedness up to diopters without astigmatism 
in august  we received fda approval to operate our laser systems at a hz pulse repetition rate  twice the originally approved rate 
currently  excimer laser vision correction systems manufactured by visx  alcon  bausch lomb and nidek have been approved for higher levels of nearsightedness than the laserscan lsx and are also approved for the treatment of nearsightedness with astigmatism for which the laserscan lsx currently does not have approval 
the visx and alcon excimer laser systems are also approved for the treatment of moderate farsightedness 
we have submitted a pma supplement to the fda for approval to utilize lasik for the treatment of nearsightedness with astigmatism and have responded to fda requests for additional patient data related to our submission 
we anticipate fda approval of this application during the second quarter of  though we cannot ensure when the approval will be received 
in addition  we have submitted pma supplements to the fda to permit our laser systems sold to customers in the us to utilize lasik to treat hyperopia  hyperopic astigmatism  and mixed astigmatism 
fda approval of these applications is anticipated by the end of  though we cannot ensure when the approval will be received 
our ability to sell our laser systems in the us may be severely impaired if the fda does not timely approve our application for our laserscan lsx to treat nearsightedness with astigmatism  our application to permit our laser systems sold to customers in the us to include our latest eye tracking technology  or our application to permit our laser systems sold to customers in the us to utilize lasik to treat myopic astigmatism  hyperopic astigmatism  and mixed astigmatism 
alcon s apex plus and ladarvision excimer laser workstations  visx s star s excimer laser system and nidek s ec excimer laser system have received fda approval for the lasik treatment of myopia nearsightedness with or without astigmatism 
the approvals for most of the systems are for the correction of myopia in the range of diopters to diopters and myopia with astigmatism generally in the range of diopters to diopters 
bausch lomb s technolas excimer laser has also received fda approval for the treatment of myopia up to diopters with up to diopters of astigmatism 
these laser systems are currently the only laser systems commercially available in the us with fda approval for use in lasik 
a physician may decide  as part of the practice of medicine  to use a medical device outside of its fda approved indications for an unapproved or off label use 
prior to these laser approvals  all lasik procedures performed in the us with commercially available lasers were performed as the practice of medicine 
in september  the fda approved alcon s ladarvision system for the correction using lasik of farsightedness of up to diopters and an astigmatism range of up to diopters 
in october  the fda approved visx s star s and s systems for the correction using prk of farsightedness of up to diopters and an astigmatism range of up to diopters 
competitors receipt of lasik specific fda regulatory approvals could give them a significant competitive advantage that could impede our ability to successfully sell our laserscan lsx system in the us or discourage physicians from using our or other manufacturers lasers off label 
our failure to successfully market our product could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of our principal competitors in the keratome business  including current market leader bausch lomb  received fda clearance prior to the commercialization of our keratome products and have substantial experience marketing their keratome products 
the established market presence in the us of previously approved laser systems and keratome products  as well as the entry of new competitors into the market upon receipt of new or expanded regulatory approvals  could impede our ability to successfully introduce our laserscan lsx system in the us and our keratome products worldwide and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships 
we believe that our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships will have a significant impact on our ability to meet our business objectives 
these strategic relationships are critical to our future success because we believe that these relationships will help us to o extend the reach of our products to a larger number of refractive surgeons  o develop and deploy new products  o further enhance the lasersight brand  and o generate additional revenue 
entering into strategic relationships is complicated because some of our current and future strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets 
in addition  we may not be able to establish relationships with key participants in our industry if they have relationships with our competitors  or if we have relationships with their competitors 
moreover  some potential strategic partners have resisted  and may continue to resist  working with us until our products and services have achieved widespread market acceptance 
once we have established strategic relationships  we will depend on our partners ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services 
to date  we have established only a limited number of strategic relationships  and many of these relationships are in the early stages of development 
there can be no assurance as to the terms  timing or consummation of any future strategic relationships 
if we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  and our business will suffer 
because the sale of our products is dependent on the continued market acceptance of laser based refractive eye surgery using the lasik procedure  the lack of broad market acceptance would hurt our business 
we believe that whether we achieve profitability and growth will depend  in part  upon the continued acceptance of laser vision correction using the lasik procedure in the us and other countries 
we cannot be certain that laser vision correction will continue to be accepted by either the refractive surgeons or the public at large as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders 
the acceptance of laser vision correction and  specifically  the lasik procedure may be adversely affected by o possible concerns relating to safety and efficacy  including the predictability  stability and quality of results  o the public s general resistance to surgery  o the effectiveness and lower cost of alternative methods of correcting refractive vision disorders  o the lack of long term follow up data  o the possibility of unknown side effects  o the lack of third party reimbursement for the procedures  o the cost of the procedure  and o possible future unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes from the use of laser vision correction 
unfavorable side effects and potential complications that may result from the use of laser vision correction systems manufactured by any manufacturer may broadly affect market acceptance of laser based vision correction surgery 
potential patients may not distinguish between our precision beam scanning spot technology and the laser technology incorporated by our competitors in their laser systems  and customers may not differentiate laser systems and procedures that have not received fda approval from fda approved systems and procedures 
any adverse consequences resulting from procedures performed with a competitor s systems or an unapproved laser system could adversely affect consumer acceptance of laser vision correction in general 
in addition  because laser vision correction is an elective procedure which is not typically covered by insurance and that involves more significant immediate expense than eyeglasses or contact lenses  adverse changes in the us or international economy may cause consumers to reassess their spending choices and to select lower cost alternatives for their vision correction needs 
any such shift in spending patterns could reduce the volume of lasik procedures performed that would  in turn  reduce our revenues from per procedure fees and sales of single use products such as our unishaper keratome and our ultraedge keratome blades 
the failure of laser vision correction to achieve continued market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
even if laser vision correction achieves and sustains market acceptance  sales of our keratome products could be adversely impacted if a laser procedure that does not require the creation of a corneal flap were to emerge as the procedure of choice 
new products or technologies could erode demand for our products or make them obsolete  and our business could be harmed if we cannot keep pace with advances in technology 
in addition to competing with eyeglasses and contact lenses  excimer laser vision correction competes or may compete with newer technologies such as intraocular lenses  corneal rings and surgical techniques using different or more advanced types of lasers 
two products that may become competitive within the near term are implantable contact lenses  which are pending fda approval  and corneal rings  which have been approved by the fda 
both of these products require procedures with lens implants  and their ultimate market acceptance is unknown at this time 
to the extent that any of these or other new technologies are perceived to be clinically superior or economically more attractive than currently marketed excimer laser vision correction procedures or techniques  they could erode demand for our excimer laser and keratome products  cause a reduction in selling prices of such products or render such products obsolete 
in addition  if one or more competing technologies achieves broader market acceptance or render laser vision correction procedures obsolete  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as is typical in the case of new and rapidly evolving industries  the demand and market for recently introduced products and technologies is uncertain  and we cannot be certain that our laserscan lsx laser system  unishaper single use keratome  ultrashaper durable keratome  ultraedge keratome blades or future new products and enhancements will be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  announcements or the anticipation of announcements of new products  whether for sale in the near future or at some later date  may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
company and business risks we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to litigation 
visx commenced a lawsuit in november in the united states district court  district of delaware  against us alleging that our laserscan lsx laser system infringes one of visx s us patents for equipment used in ophthalmic surgery 
the laserscan lsx is the only laser system we are currently marketing and is the only laser system manufactured by us that is approved for sale to us customers 
the suit requests  among other things  injunctive relief  treble damages and attorneys fees and expenses 
management does not believe that our laserscan lsx laser system infringes the asserted visx patent 
however  we had agreed to a stay of such litigation to pursue license negotiations with visx in an effort to help facilitate commercialization of the laserscan lsx in the us market 
we withdrew from license negotiations with visx in february  and after the stay of the litigation was lifted  we filed suit against visx  claiming non infringement and invalidity of the visx patent and asserting that visx infringes us patent no 
 to which we hold an exclusive license 
we also began to sell and ship our laserscan lsx laser systems in the us during march we believe that the claims visx has made against us are without merit and we intend to vigorously contest them 
however  if we are unsuccessful in defending this lawsuit  we may be enjoined from manufacturing and selling our laserscan lsx laser system in the us without a license from visx 
in addition  we may be subject to damages for past infringement 
no assurance can be given as to whether we will be subject to such damages or  if so  the amount of damages that we may be required to pay 
in addition  such patent litigation is time consuming  is causing us to incur substantial expense  could divert management s attention  could cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into license agreements in order to market our products 
such license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the outcome of patent litigation  particularly in jury trials  is inherently uncertain  and an unfavorable outcome in the visx litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will be required to significantly expand our us manufacturing operations to meet our business plan and must comply with stringent regulation of our manufacturing operations 
we manufacture our laserscan lsx laser systems for sale in the us at our manufacturing facility in winter park  florida  and continue to manufacture our laser systems for sale in international markets at our manufacturing facility in costa rica 
our us personnel have limited experience manufacturing laser systems 
we cannot  therefore  assure you that we will not encounter difficulties in increasing our production capacity for our laser systems at our florida facility  including problems involving production delays  quality control or assurance  component supply and lack of qualified personnel 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experience with the use of the product 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda  certain state agencies and international regulatory agencies 
we require that our key suppliers comply with recognized standards as well as our own quality standards  and we regularly test the components and sub assemblies supplied to us 
any failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including the fda s quality systems good manufacturing practice qsr gmp regulations  could cause production and distribution of our products to be delayed or prohibited  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
required minimum payments under our keratome license agreement may exceed our gross profits from sales of our keratome products 
in addition to the risk that the unishaper single use keratome or ultrashaper durable keratome will not be accepted in the marketplace  we are required to make certain minimum payments to the licensor under our amended and restated keratome license agreement 
under the original agreement  we were required to provide an excimer laser system and pay a total of  to the licensor in two equal installments due six and months after the date of our receipt of the production molds for the unishaper product 
we provided the laser system to the licensor during the quarter ended june   and we received the molds in late we shipped the first unishaper single use keratome in december and paid one half of the  in july in addition  beginning seven months after the first commercial shipment  we were required to make royalty payments equal to of our defined gross profits from the sale of our unishaper and ultrashaper keratomes  with a minimum royalty of  per calendar quarter for a period of eight quarters 
on january   we entered into an amended and restated license and royalty agreement related to certain keratome related products 
this amendment replaced a january  amendment in its entirety 
under the terms of the amendment we issued  shares of common stock to the licensors  valued at approximately million  in partial payment for royalties during the term of the license 
the term of the license was extended three years until july  in addition  minimum royalty payments totaling approximately million will be due in quarterly installments through the term of the amendment 
as a result of our obligations under this license arrangement  the minimum royalty payments we are required to make to the licensors may exceed our gross profits from sales of our unishaper and ultrashaper keratome products 
the amendment eliminated the restriction on us manufacturing  marketing and selling other keratomes  but the sale of such other keratomes is included in the gross profit to be shared with the licensors 
the licensor s share of the gross profit  as defined in the agreement  decreased from to 
our failure to timely obtain or expand regulatory approvals for our products and to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 
our excimer laser systems and keratome products are subject to strict governmental regulations that materially affect our ability to manufacture and market these products and directly impact our overall business prospects 
fda regulations impose design and performance standards  labeling and reporting requirements  and submission conditions in advance of marketing for all medical laser products in the us new product introductions  expanded treatment types and levels for approved products  and significant design or manufacturing modifications require a premarket clearance or approval by the fda prior to commercialization in the us the fda approval process  which is lengthy and uncertain  requires supporting clinical studies and substantial commitments of financial and management resources 
failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and clearances in the us and other countries  or significant delays in obtaining these approvals and clearances  could prevent us from marketing our products for either approved or expanded indications or treatments  that could substantially decrease our future revenues 
additionally  product and procedure labeling and all forms of promotional activities are subject to examination by the fda  and current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing by manufacturers of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
noncompliance with these requirements may result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  recall or seizure of products  suspension of manufacturing  denial or withdrawal of pmas  and criminal prosecution 
laser products marketed in foreign countries are often subject to local laws governing health product development processes  that may impose additional costs for overseas product development 
future legislative or administrative requirements  in the us or elsewhere  may adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain regulatory approval for our products 
the failure to obtain approvals for new or additional uses on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our competitive position may be adversely affected 
our business plan is predicated on our proprietary systems and technology  including our precision beam scanning spot technology laser systems 
we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property 
misappropriation of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
in addition  we may have to engage in litigation or other legal proceedings in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of invalidity 
these legal proceedings may consume considerable resources  including management time and attention  which would be diverted from the operation of our business  and the outcome of any such legal proceeding is inherently uncertain 
we are aware that certain competitors are developing products that may potentially infringe patents owned or licensed exclusively by us 
in order to protect our rights in these patents  we may find it necessary to assert and pursue infringement claims against such third parties 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources litigating such infringement claims and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in resolving such claims or that the resolution of any such dispute will be on terms that are favorable to us 
see we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to litigation 
patent infringement allegations may impair our ability to manufacture and market our products 
there are a number of us and foreign patents covering methods and apparatus for performing corneal surgery that we do not own or have the right to use 
if we were found to infringe a patent in a particular market  we and our customers may be enjoined from manufacturing  marketing  selling and using the infringing product in the market and may be liable for damages for any past infringement of such rights 
in order to continue using such rights  we would be required to obtain a license  which may require us to make royalty  per procedure or other fee payments 
we cannot be certain if we or our customers will be successful in securing licenses  or that if we obtain licenses  such licenses will be available on acceptable terms 
alternatively  we might be required to redesign the infringing aspects of these products 
any redesign efforts that we undertake could be expensive and might require regulatory review 
furthermore  the redesign efforts could delay the reintroduction of these products into certain markets  or may be so significant as to be impractical 
if redesign efforts were impractical  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling the infringing products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  summit and visx formed a us partnership  pillar point partners  to pool certain of their patents related to corneal sculpting technologies 
as part of their agreement to dissolve pillar point in june  summit and visx granted each other a worldwide  royalty free cross license whereby each party has full rights to license for use with its own systems all existing patents owned by either company relating to laser vision correction 
in connection with our march settlement of litigation with pillar point regarding alleged infringement by our lasers of certain us and foreign patents  we entered into a license agreement with visx covering various foreign patents and patent applications pursuant to which we pay royalties to visx 
litigation involving patents is common in our industry 
while we do not believe our laser systems or keratome products infringe any valid and enforceable patents held by visx  alcon or any other person  visx has asserted that we infringe their intellectual property  and we cannot assure you that one or more of our other competitors or other persons will not assert that our products infringe their intellectual property  or that we will not in the future be deemed to infringe one or more patents owned by them or some other party 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to market one or more of our products 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to litigation 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our international sales 
our international sales accounted for and of our total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the future  we expect that sales to international accounts will continue to represent a lower percentage of our total sales as a result of our recent and anticipated additional regulatory approvals to market our laserscan lsx laser system in the usand the anticipated commercial launch of our ultrashaper durable keratome in the second quarter of see industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
the majority of our international revenues for the year ended december  were from customers in korea  mexico  malaysia  and italy  and for the year ended december  were from customers in canada  mexico  spain  italy  belgium and france 
international sales of our products may be limited or disrupted by o the imposition of government controls  o export license requirements  o economic or political instability  o trade restrictions  o difficulties in obtaining or maintaining export licenses  o changes in tariffs  and o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
our sales have historically been and are expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars 
the european economic union s conversion to a common currency  the euro  is not expected to have a material impact on our business 
however  due to our significant export sales  we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the effective price in local currencies of our products 
this could result in reduced sales  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting receivables relating to our international sales 
our supply of certain critical components and systems may be interrupted because of our reliance on a limited number of suppliers 
we currently purchase certain components used in the production  operation and maintenance of our laser systems and keratome products from a limited number of suppliers and certain key components are provided by a single vendor 
for example  all of our keratome blades are currently manufactured exclusively by becton dickinson and all of our unishaper single use keratome products are manufactured exclusively by frantz medical development ltd 
pursuant to our agreement with them 
we do not have written long term contracts with providers of some key laser system components  including tui lasertechnik und laserintegration gmbh  which currently is a single source supplier for the laser heads used in our laserscan lsx excimer laser system 
currently  sensomotoric instruments gmbh  teltow  germany  is a single source supplier for the eye tracker boards used in the laserscan lsx 
any interruption in the supply of critical laser or keratome components could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of our key suppliers ceases providing us with products of acceptable quality and quantity at a competitive price and in a timely fashion  we would have to locate and contract with a substitute supplier and  in some cases  such substitute supplier would need to be qualified by the fda 
if substitute suppliers cannot be located and qualified in a timely manner or could not provide required products on commercially reasonable terms  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unlawful tampering of our system configurations could result in reduced revenues 
we include a procedure counting mechanism on laserscan lsx lasers manufactured for sale and use in the us users of our laserscan lsx excimer laser system could tamper with the software or hardware configuration of the system so as to alter or eliminate the procedure counting mechanism that facilitates the collection of per procedure fees 
unauthorized tampering with our procedure counting mechanism by users could result in the loss of per procedure fees 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends in part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key employees  especially michael r 
farris  our president and chief executive officer 
a loss of one or more such officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any officer or key employee 
as we commercially launch our laser system and keratome products in the us  we will need to continue to implement and expand our operational  sales and marketing  financial and management resources and controls 
while to date we have not experienced problems recruiting or retaining the personnel necessary to expand our business  we cannot assure you that we will not have such problems in the future 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals for necessary positions  and if we are unable to effectively manage growth in our domestic or international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inadequacy or unavailability of insurance may expose us to substantial product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks and possible adverse publicity that are inherent in the development  testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices for human use 
these risks increase with respect to our products that receive regulatory approval for commercialization 
we have agreed in the past  and we will likely agree in the future  to indemnify certain medical institutions and personnel who conduct and participate in our clinical studies 
while we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that any such liability will be covered by our insurance or that damages will not exceed the limits of our coverage 
even if a claim is covered by insurance  the costs of defending a product liability  malpractice  negligence or other action  and the assessment of damages in excess of insurance coverage in the event of a successful product liability claim  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  product liability insurance may not continue to be available  either at existing or increased levels of coverage  on commercially reasonable terms 
financial and liquidity risks we have experienced significant losses and operating cash flow deficits and we expect that operating cash flow deficits will continue through at least the first half of we experienced significant net losses and deficits in cash flow from operations for the years ended december   and  as set forth in the following table 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive operating cash flow in the future 
year ended december  net loss million million million deficit in cash flow from operations million million million as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
if our uncollectible receivables exceed our reserves we will incur additional unanticipated expenses  and we may experience difficulty collecting restructured receivables with extended payment terms 
although we monitor the status of our receivables and maintain a reserve for estimated losses  we cannot be certain that our reserves for estimated losses  which were approximately million at december   will be sufficient to cover the amount of our actual write offs over time 
at december   our net trade accounts and notes receivable totaled approximately million  and accrued commissions  the payment of which generally depends on the collection of such net trade accounts and notes receivable  totaled approximately million 
actual write offs that exceed amounts reserved could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of any loss that we may have to recognize in connection with our inability to collect receivables is principally dependent on our customer s ongoing financial condition  their ability to generate revenues from our laser systems  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against delinquent customers 
our ability to evaluate the financial condition and revenue generating ability of our prospective customers located outside of the us  and our ability to obtain and enforce legal judgments against customers located outside of the us  is generally more limited than for our customers located in the us our agreements with our international customers typically provide that the contracts are governed by florida law 
we have not determined whether or to what extent courts or administrative agencies located in foreign countries would enforce our right to collect such receivables or to recover laser systems from customers in the event of a customer s payment default 
when a customer is not paying according to established terms  we attempt to communicate and understand the underlying causes and work with the customer to resolve any issues we can control or influence 
in most cases  we have been able to resolve the customer s issues and continue to collect our receivable  either on the original schedule or under restructured terms 
if such issues are not resolved  we evaluate our legal and other alternatives based on existing facts and circumstances 
in most such cases  we have concluded that the account should be written off as uncollectible 
at december   we had extended the original payment terms of laser customer accounts totaling approximately million by periods ranging from to months 
such restructured receivables represent approximately of our gross receivables as of that date 
our liquidity and operating cash flow would be adversely affected if additional extensions become necessary in the future 
in addition  it would be more difficult to collect laser system receivables if the payment schedule extends beyond the expected or actual economic life of the system  which we estimate to be approximately five to seven years 
to date  we do not believe any payment schedule extends beyond the economic life of the applicable laser system 
we could require additional financing which might not be available if we need it 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced deficits in cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively 
we are currently exploring opportunities for additional equity financing through a private placement of our common stock 
we believe that  in addition to our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operations  some form of equity or debt financing may be necessary to fund our anticipated working capital requirements for the next months in accordance with our current business plan 
our belief regarding future working capital requirements is based on various factors and assumptions including the growth in laser sales resulting from our entrance into the us market in march with corresponding increases in accounts receivable and inventory purchases to date  the uncertain timing of astigmatism and other supplemental fda approvals for our laserscan lsx excimer laser system  which could continue to impact our sales during  the uncertain timing of the market introduction of our ultrashaper durable keratomes  commercial acceptance of our ultraedge keratome blades and unishaper single use keratomes  which we believe is partially dependent upon the successful introduction of the ultrashaper  the anticipated timely collection of receivables  and the absence of unanticipated product development and marketing costs 
see industry and competitive risks we cannot assure you that our keratome products will achieve market acceptance 
these factors and assumptions are subject to certain contingencies and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not collect a material portion of current receivables in a timely manner  or experience less market demand for our products than we anticipate  our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
in march  we entered into a million term loan and million revolving credit facility with heller 
we may borrow amounts under this credit facility at an annual rate equal to above the prime rate for short term working capital needs or for such other purposes as may be approved by heller 
borrowings are limited to of qualified accounts receivable related to us sales 
the credit facility replaces a million credit facility that was entered into in september borrowings under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the facility requires us to maintain a minimum net worth 
at march   we had no borrowings under the credit facility 
we expect to seek additional equity financing in the future to implement our business plan or any changes thereto in response to future developments or unanticipated contingencies 
we currently do not have any commitments for additional financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future to the extent required or that  if available  it will be on commercially acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the terms of the new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  the terms of the debt could require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest and may render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
if we are not able to obtain financing necessary to meet our working capital needs  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
common stock risks variations in our sales and operating results may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  historically a significant portion of our laser system orders for a particular quarter have been received and shipped near the end of the quarter 
as a result  our operating results for any quarter often depend on the timing of the receipt of orders and the subsequent shipment of our laser systems 
other factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include o timing of regulatory approvals and the introduction or delays in shipment of new products  o reductions  cancellations or fulfillment of major orders  o the addition or loss of significant customers  o the relative mix of our business  o changes in pricing by us or our competitors  o costs related to expansion of our business  and o increased competition 
as a result of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in some quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to any of the factors described above or other uncertainties 
the market price of our common stock may continue to experience extreme fluctuations due to market conditions that are unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock market  and in particular the securities of technology companies like us  could experience extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance 
our stock price has historically been volatile 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic or foreign governmental regulations or regulatory approval processes  developments or disputes relating to patent or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of refractive vision correction procedures  and changes in reports and recommendations of securities analysts  have and may continue to have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
the significant number of shares eligible for future sale and dilutive stock issuances may adversely affect our stock price 
sales  or the possibility of sales  of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
substantially all of our  shares of common stock outstanding at march  were freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of  except to the extent such shares are held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule under the securities act or subject only to the satisfaction of a prospectus delivery requirement 
shares of common stock that we may issue in the future in connection with acquisitions or financings or pursuant to outstanding warrants or agreements could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause significant dilution in our earnings per share and net book value per share 
we may be required to issue more than  additional shares of common stock upon the conversion of outstanding preferred stock  the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options  and the satisfaction of certain contingent contractual obligations 
see capitalization description of capital stock warrants and other agreements to issue shares 
the anti dilution provisions of certain of our existing securities and obligations require us to issue additional shares if we issue shares of common stock below specified price levels 
if a future share issuance triggers these adjustments  the beneficiaries of such provisions effectively receive some protection from declines in the market price of our common stock  while our other stockholders incur additional dilution of their ownership interest 
we may include similar anti dilution provisions in securities issued in connection with future financings 
anti takeover provisions under delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation  by laws and stockholder rights plan may make an acquisition of lasersight more difficult and could prevent you from receiving a premium over the market price of our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors  discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay  defer or prevent a change in control of us  even if such events could be beneficial  in the short term  to the economic interests of our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder action  and our by laws require advance notice of director nominations or other proposals by stockholders 
we also are subject to provisions of delaware corporation law that prohibit a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns or more of the corporation s common stock an interested stockholder for three years after the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights agreement  or poison pill  and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire or more of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
acquisition risks past and possible future acquisitions that are not successfully integrated with our existing operations may adversely affect our business 
we have made several significant acquisitions since  and we may in the future selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of  investments in  or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances with  companies whose business or technology complement our business 
we may not be able to identify suitable candidates to acquire or enter into joint ventures or other arrangements with entities  and we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms for such activities 
in addition  we could have difficulty assimilating the personnel  technology and operations of any acquired companies  which could prevent us from realizing expected synergies  and may incur unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 
this could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and other resources 
amortization and charges relating to our significant intangible assets could adversely affect our stock price and reported net income or loss 
of our total assets at december   approximately million  or  were goodwill or other intangible assets 
any reduction in net income or increase in net loss resulting from the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from future acquisitions by us may have an adverse impact upon the market price of our common stock
