item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development and exploration activities 
the average realized prices of oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to market conditions 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves and other factors 
production rates  value based production taxes  labor and maintenance expenses are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period 
oil and gas reserves 
estimates of reserve quantities and related future net cash flows are calculated using unescalated year end oil and gas prices and operating costs  and may be subject to substantial fluctuations based on the prices in effect at the end of each year 
the following table sets forth a comparison of year end reserves  the weighted average prices used in calculating estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows  pre tax future net cash flows discounted at  and per barrel of oil equivalent discounted cash flows at the end of  and quantities in thousands  except for pricing and per barrel of oil equivalent amounts year end sec proved reserves year end sec pre tax oil gas prices pre tax values mmbls mmcf boe oil gas values per boe gas converted at  mcf per barrel 
reserve revisions occur when the economic limit of a property is lengthened or shortened due to changes in commodity pricing 
the following excerpt from the footnotes to the company s financial statements shows the effect of changing oil prices on the volume of oil reserves shown in thousands of barrels year ended december  proved oil reserves s beginning of year    revisions of previous estimates   extensions and discoveries improved recovery acquisition of minerals in place sales of minerals in place production end of year    as oil prices increased only slightly from year end to year end vs 
 respectively  revisions due to price changes during were lower than in previous years 
the revisions of  and  barrels in and  respectively  were primarily price related 
during the early winter of  gas prices reached record highs 
the average index price for the company s gas reserves was per mcf at the end of  compared to per mcf at the end of accordingly  the majority of the company s upward revision of gas volumes at year end of bcf was due primarily to higher year end prices 
excluding revisions to previous estimates  the company s drilling and acquisition activities added  barrels of oil equivalent reserves  of total oil and gas production 
subsequent to year end  the company entered into an agreement to acquire approximately  barrels of proved oil reserves  with an effective date of december  the reserves are associated with several producing wells located adjacent to the company s ashley valley field in utah 
the company has a working interest in these properties 
the reserves acquired have not been included in year end reserve figures 
drilling and acquisition activities  which were curtailed for much of the year  added  barrels of oil equivalent to the company s proved reserve base  replacing of production 
in  the company added  barrels of oil equivalent  equal to of oil and gas production 
further information concerning the company s reserve volumes and values can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for assets held for disposal  requires successful efforts companies to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying costs of their proved oil and gas properties by comparing the expected undiscounted future net revenues from each producing field with the related net capitalized costs at the end of each period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenues  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues from the producing field 
during  the company recorded an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   net of tax associated with certain properties that experienced increased operating costs  declining production  reduced prospectivity due to unsuccessful drilling  and other technical problems that reduced their economic reserves or value 
during  the company recorded an impairment of proved oil and gas properties of   net of tax 
primarily as a result of depressed year end oil prices  the company recorded proved property impairment charges of  in results of operations comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
year long higher oil prices  combined with record gas prices during the early winter of  enabled the company to recognize record revenues in oil and gas sales for the year of  were higher than those recorded in  as average oil and gas prices were and higher  respectively 
revenues were reduced by  in by costs associated with the company s hedging program  which was instituted in as a requirement of its bank financing arrangement 
the company had barrels of oil per day hedged under a costless collar  with a floor of and a ceiling of  which terminated on september  the company had an additional barrels of oil per day hedged under a second costless collar  with a floor of and a ceiling of 
this collar terminated on december  the floor and ceilings were based on the average near month wti price on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
while the company may hedge future volumes as a means to mitigate price risk and or to ensure the availability of capital to fund its drilling programs  there are no further requirements to hedge under its bank arrangement 
as of january   the company had no volumes of oil or gas subject to hedging arrangements 
after taking into consideration the hedging costs discussed above  average oil prices received in were per barrel  up from per barrel in gas prices were also up sharply  averaging per mcf in  compared to per mcf in oil production rose slightly from  barrels in to  barrels in gas production in was  mcf compared to  mcf last year 
the reduction in gas production was due in part to the company s reduced drilling program and reduced drilling success in california during and due to some unexpected lengthy repair work on a mile section of a pg e main line  the company also had approximately mmcfd shut in for most of the third quarter of in addition  the company sold all of its gas producing properties that were located in texas in other income 
included in revenues is  in non recurring property sales recognized in the first quarter of the year 
the company also recognized gains on the sale of securities and revenue from property promotions that were non recurring 
lease operating costs 
operating costs rose from levels on a cost basis  and on a barrel of oil equivalent basis 
the most significant factor leading to this increase was a function of higher oil and gas prices resulting in higher value based production taxes 
in addition  the company s higher cost  lower margin oil properties were on production the entire year  whereas a portion of these properties were shut in during part of depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a per unit charges decreased slightly from per boe in to per boe in impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
d seismic and exploration expenses 
the company participated in two new d seismic surveys during the first was a mile survey at the company s rancho colusa prospect in the sacramento basin of california 
the second was a mile survey at the company s beaver creek prospect in north dakota 
the costs of both surveys were charged to expense during the year 
the company curtailed its use of d seismic in in response to low oil prices during the first part of the year 
higher exploration costs in reflected higher dry hole costs incurred during the year 
while the company drilled only one more dry hole in than in  the wells drilled in carried a higher working interest than those of the previous year 
dry hole costs in were approximately  higher than the amount recorded in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from levels 
the increase was due to higher compensation  employee relocation  and shareholder expenses 
during the low oil price environment of early  the company froze salaries  reduced employee benefits  and made other compensation reductions 
as oil prices have increased  the company has restored some of these previous reductions 
in addition  the company recorded overhead expenses associated with its new cody  wyoming office 
interest and income taxes 
lower interest costs in reflect lower balances outstanding under the company s credit facility 
during  the company reduced its credit facility debt by  income tax expense recorded for both periods reflect the results of operations  as well as various credits available to the company 
details concerning the components of the tax provision can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
oil and gas sales increased more than in over levels 
higher oil and gas prices were offset somewhat by decreases in both oil and gas production 
total revenues increased from to oil production decreased in  as a number of the company s high cost  low margin oil wells were shut in during the first several months of the year 
oil production was  barrels  compared to  barrels in gas production decreased to bcf in from bcf in gas production declined primarily as a result of reduced drilling in california during and  as well as the sale of the company s texas gas properties during the fourth quarter of while average year end oil prices in were more than double those of year end  the average price received for the entire year increased a more modest 
higher second half prices were offset by abnormally low prices in the first half of the year 
the company s average oil price for the full year of was compared to per barrel realized during gas prices were also higher  averaging per mcf in compared to per mcf in lease operating costs 
lease operating costs decreased over the prior year 
higher per unit costs were offset by reduced volumes 
per unit costs rose as the company recorded higher value based production taxes associated with higher oil prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a per unit charges decreased from per boe in to per boe in the primary reason for the per unit decrease was the elimination of approximately million from the company s depletable base through a property impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  higher oil prices enabled the company to record positive reserve revisions  which in turn decreased dd a rates for many of the company s oil properties 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
equity loss in symskaya exploration  incorporated 
the equity loss in symskaya exploration decreased by  during as operations continue to be curtailed at the project  symskaya terminated its only domestic employee  and further reduced administrative expenses in the loss included  of accrued interest income on a senior note between symskaya and the company that had been recognized in prior periods 
the amount also included the company s share of a bottom hole contribution that was not repeated in d seismic and exploration expenses 
lower exploration costs in resulted from the company s reduced drilling program 
during  the company incurred approximately  in dry hole costs compared to approximately  in in addition  as a result of the company s cost cutting measures in  the company reduced other exploratory geological and administrative costs by 
in  the company incurred d seismic charges in the amount of  associated with its sequoia prospect in california 
the company curtailed its use of d seismic in in response to low oil prices during the first part of the year 
general and administrative expenses 
the company cut its general and administrative expenses by  or  from levels 
in response to abnormally low oil prices in the beginning of  the company made a concerted effort to reduce overhead costs through staff reductions  lower compensation costs  reduced employee benefits and other costs 
interest and income taxes 
lower interest costs in reflect lower average interest rates on the debt outstanding under the company s credit facility 
the income tax expense benefits recorded for both periods reflect the results of operations  as well as various credits available to the company 
details concerning the components of the tax provision can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company took advantage of higher oil and gas prices  increased cash flows  and positive financial results in  to continue to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its financial flexibility 
the company s cash balances increased by from december  working capital at december  was higher than that at december  the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities also improved  reaching to at december  compared to to at the end of as cash flow from operating activities more than doubled in  the company reduced its outstanding debt by 
higher cash flows also enabled the company to expand its drilling and workover programs in capital expenditures increased over levels  reaching approximately million in the company s capital expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of certain non core oil and gas properties 
in september of  the company obtained a million reducing revolving credit facility with bank one texas  na the facility has an initial commitment of million  and the maturity date of the facility is september   three years from the date of closing 
the new facility has a libor or a prime interest rate option  the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding at december  was percent 
the company s commitment under its credit facility is subject to a redetermination as of may and november of each year  with estimated future oil and gas prices used in the evaluation determined by the company s lender 
as of december   the company had  or  of remaining availability on the facility 
the company is in compliance with all its facility covenants 
the company utilized its higher cash flows in to reduce the amount of debt outstanding  making principal reductions of  during the year 
excess cash flows in enabled the company to make principal payments of  during that year 
should the company have cash flows in excess of its capital requirements for  additional reductions of outstanding debt during the year may occur 
cash flow from operating activities of  was higher than the amount recorded during while increased net income was the primary driver for the increase  the following items impacted the amount as well 
at the end of  the company had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards  all of which was utilized during to offset taxable income 
as a result  deferred income taxes increased by approximately million year to year 
as gas prices reached record levels in november and december of  resulting in higher accrued revenues  the company s accounts receivable at year end were approximately million higher than at year end the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of invoice payments by the company 
in addition  the assumption of operations in the big horn basin led to increases in both receivables and payables as the company assumed responsibilities for the payment of invoices on behalf of its partners 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operating activities  and funds available under the company s credit facility will provide adequate resources to meet its capital and exploration spending objectives for the company has adequate liquidity to maintain its operations as they currently exist 
commitments 
under the terms of symskaya s license and production sharing agreement psa  equity was committed to advance symskaya a minimum of million during the first contract years  representing of the minimum expenditures called for in the license and psc  with the remainder being funded by leucadia national corporation  symskaya s other shareholder 
the first contract year began november  the amounts spent through november   the end of the fifth contract year  have satisfied all minimum commitments required
