the die cast vehicles are replicas of cars driven by individual drivers and are principally nascar  formula one and nhra replicas 
third parties manufacture all of the motorsports vehicles and most of the apparel and souvenirs  generally utilizing our designs  tools  and dies 
we screen print and embroider a portion of the apparel 
formula one vehicles and apparel are designed and marketed by subsidiaries in germany 
the popularity and performance of drivers and teams under license  the popularity of motorsports  particularly nascar  and the general demand for licensed sports merchandise impact revenue positively and negatively 
we strive to structure our operations such that we maintain price point control over product in the marketplace 
manufacturing costs are fixed due to outsourcing under fixed price contracts 
royalties are generally variable with sales 
research and development is basic design and engineering 
capital expenditures are principally tooling for die cast 
due to agreements with distributors and qvc  incremental volume does not proportionately increase distribution costs 
functions outside of core skills are generally outsourced 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products procured from third party manufacturers  freight charges  royalty payments to licensors  and depreciation of tooling and dies 
significant factors affecting cost of sales as a percentage of sales include the following product mix  the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily depreciation of tooling and dies  over varying levels of net sales  the type of freight charges  and additional charges related to lower than minimum order quantities and cancellation of specific purchase orders 

table of contents because the auto racing season is concentrated between the months of february and november  the second and third calendar quarters of each year our third and fourth fiscal quarters are historically characterized by higher sales of motorsports products 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain expense and revenue items 
net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and other intangibles income loss from operations interest expense and other  net income loss before income taxes and extraordinary gain income taxes net income loss before extraordinary gain the above percentages have been adjusted to reflect adoption of eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  in the quarter ended september  special charges in fiscal  we recorded charges of million arising from the decision to abandon our internet strategy  relating to goracing 
com 
the charges include provision for the write off of goodwill  endorsements  sponsorship commitments  employee severance and termination costs  and the withdrawal of the initial public offering of goracing 
com 
the charges are reflected in the fiscal financial statements as follows in millions selling  general and administrative non cash charges accounts receivable and prepaids initial public offering withdrawal other cash charges professional fees employee severance and termination costs endorsements and sponsorships selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles we completely utilized the accruals for the above cash charges of million with cash payments of million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents in addition to the goracing 
com charges  the fiscal financial statements include charges of million for restructuring and other costs 
anticipated sponsorships  and driver and marketing programs did not materialize as anticipated  contributing to million in inventory write downs 
vendor discounts totaling million were anticipated but not received due to lower than anticipated volumes 
a change in the estimated useful lives of tooling equipment and identification of obsolete items caused tooling write downs and amortization totaling million 
we decided to concentrate future production on core drivers and core programs contributing to write downs of prepaid royalties and sponsorship fees of million 
revised estimates of the collectibility of certain customer account balances indicated million of additional receivable reserve requirements 
we determined the goodwill related to the die cast helmet product line was worthless resulting in a million impairment 
these charges are reflected in the fiscal financial statements as follows in millions cost of sales inventory write downs vendor discounts depreciation tooling write down tooling amortization prepaid royalty and sponsorship fees total cost of sale selling  general and administrative accounts receivable other assets total selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles impairments minority interests and other  net other equity investments fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  sales increased to million for from million in the prior year 
domestic die cast sales increased 
domestic apparel sales increased and foreign sales increased 
in the second fiscal quarter  in connection with the start of the nascar racing season  consumer demand increased significantly 
due to the shorter production lead time  sales in domestic apparel operations strengthened after the first quarter 
however  because of the day lead time required to produce and ship die cast replicas  product was not available for shipment to customers until late in the third quarter 
as a result  domestic die cast sales growth was lower than apparel sales growth 
gross profit improved to million in fiscal from million in the fiscal the prior year period included million of special charges 
the gross profit percentage improved to of sales from of sales  after considering the effect of special charges 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales resulted from reduced freight  product and production costs and the leverage attained from higher die cast production quantities with relatively fixed tooling and die depreciation costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the prior year 
the prior year included million of special charges 
selling  general and administrative  excluding the special charges  represented of sales in and of sales in the decrease as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from costs eliminated as a result of the outsourcing agreement with qvc and cost reductions realized from management and restructuring changes made in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we also benefited from the full year effect of headcount reductions in fiscal 
table of contents amortization of goodwill and other intangibles decreased to million for from million in the prior year 
the prior year period included million of special charges 
the million decrease  net of the special charge  is related to the elimination of goodwill and related amortization from the sale of fantasy sports and the reductions in amortization expense as a result of the impairment write offs of goodwill and other intangibles recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal interest expense and other  net for was million lower than the prior year 
the reduction is primarily the result of the million reduction in interest expense as a result of the convertible subordinated note repurchases discussed further in liquidity and capital resources and other long term debt and liabilities reductions since last year 
the effective tax rate of in compares to an effective rate of in fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  we incurred a loss of million for fiscal compared with net income of million for the fiscal the fiscal year loss included million of restructuring and other charges as discussed in special charges above 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal  a decline of from the million reported for fiscal the decrease reflected a general decline in sports licensed merchandise sales  a decline in the number of promotional programs  and a decline in sales for certain licensed products that had enjoyed materially increased sales in the previous year 
cost of sales for fiscal was million or of sales compared with million for fiscal or of sales 
before special charges  cost of sales was million or of sales 
this percentage was greater than the percentage for because of increased freight costs as a percentage of cost of sales  increased manufacturing costs due to change orders  and lower order quantities and sales of product at discounted prices 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million or of sales for fiscal compared with million for fiscal or of sales 
excluding special charges  such expenses were million for fiscal or of sales 
the increase before special charges of million for fiscal was principally due to the costs of operating goracing 
com prior to abandoning our internet strategy  the costs of operating fantasy sports  which was acquired in fiscal  and an increase in sponsorships and additional professional fees 
the percentage increase was also due to the reduction in sales volume without a corresponding reduction in such costs 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal excluding the special charge for the write off of the goracing 
com and simpson products  inc intangible  amortization was million for fiscal interest expense and other  net for reflects reduced minority interests of million resulting from lower income from our owned german subsidiary 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal  representing of the pre tax  loss compared with a tax provision of million for fiscal  representing of the pre tax income 
the percentage income tax benefit for fiscal was less than the percentage tax provision for fiscal principally because of the special charges for the write off of intangibles that did not have a tax basis and because no benefit was recorded for state and federal tax jurisdictions 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in the three fiscal years ended september  in thousands  except per share amounts 
all quarterly information was obtained from unaudited financial statements not otherwise contained in this report 
we believe that all necessary adjustments have been made to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report

includes million of special  principally non cash charges related to restructuring  costs associated with a reorganization  and a decision to refocus on our core drivers and core programs 
our cost of sales was million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  or of sales  compared with million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  or of sales 
before special charges  fourth quarter cost of sales was million  or of sales 
the increase in the percentage of sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to increased freight costs and sales of product at discounted prices 
loss from operations reflects the factors described in footnote above as well as increases in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  or of sales  compared with million during fiscal  or of sales 
excluding special charges during fiscal  such expenses were million  or of sales 
the percentage increase was in part due to the reduction in sales without a corresponding reduction in such costs 
revenues have been restated in all periods for adoption of eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  in the quarter ended september  our revenue and operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of seasonality factors related to the commencement february and completion november of the nascar race season 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our past financial results may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
seasonality because the auto racing season is concentrated between the months of february and november  the second and third calendar quarters of each year our third and fourth fiscal quarters generally are characterized by higher sales of motorsports products 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital position increased to million at september   from million at september  cash increased as a result of increased profitability  proceeds from the sale fantasy sports million  receipt of an income tax refund million  proceeds upon exercise of stock options million and other operating activities  including net inventory reductions since september  the increases in cash were offset by reductions in cash for repurchases of convertible subordinated notes million and other debt million  treasury stock purchases million  winner s circle acquisition million  expenditures for equipment million and other operating activities  including volume related increases in accounts receivable million 
days sales outstanding  calculated on quarterly sales  improved over fiscal as a result of improved receivables management 
inventory turns  calculated on quarterly cost of sales  improved over fiscal  with the implementation of a build to order approach in die cast operations and better inventory management 
our backlog at september   was approximately million  with fulfillment scheduled primarily over the following two fiscal quarters 

table of contents as of september   million of convertible subordinated notes were outstanding 
the subordinated notes are convertible  at the option of the holders  into shares of common stock at the initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments in certain events 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on april and october of each year 
the notes mature on april  the notes are general unsecured obligations of our company  subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined in the notes 
the indenture governing the notes does not limit or prohibit our company or our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt  including senior indebtedness 
we have the option to redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time on or after april   at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the notes 
upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading  as defined in the indenture  the holders of the subordinated notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holders notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in july  the board of directors approved a one year program in which we may purchase up to one million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no shares have been purchased under the program 
during fiscal  we repurchased notes with a face value of million at pretax gains of million 
the notes were repurchased using million in cash and thousand shares of common stock  previously  reacquired as treasury stock  with a market value of million 
the difference between the treasury shares million cost and million market value increased additional paid in capital 
during fiscal  we also paid million in cash to settle a long term obligation  extending through  and valued at million 
the resulting million pre tax gain is included in extraordinary gain 
the settlement also eliminated future contingent royalty payments for trademark usage through in september  the company entered into a loan and security agreement the agreement with a subsidiary of bank one bank one  providing for borrowings up to million  subject to the limitation of a calculated borrowing base  and including up to million of stand by letters of credit 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank one corporate base plus or libor plus 
the agreement provides for commitment fee of of the average unused line of credit and to of the average unused letters of credit payable annually and expires december the agreement is secured principally by inventory  receivables and equipment 
the agreement contains covenants  which require the company to meet certain financial tests principally related to tangible net worth and ebitda  and restricts the payment of dividends 
the calculated borrowing base generally totals less than million at current accounts receivable levels 
at september   letters of credit totaled million and the available line of credit totaled million 
we believe that the revised borrowing base will be adequate to cover our letter of credit and other liquidity needs for the next months after considering anticipated cash flow from operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures in fiscal will principally relate to expenditures for tooling and a building addition in germany 
our capital expenditures are not anticipated to exceed million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit instruments and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
we do not currently use and we have not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
at september   we had million outstanding under our convertible subordinated notes at an interest rate of  and approximately million of debt outstanding at various rates and terms  principally under promissory notes and capital leases 
interest rates on these credit instruments are fixed and comparable to current market rates 

table of contents the functional currency for our foreign operation is the euro 
as such  changes in exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our future earnings 
given the level of income we currently derive from our foreign operations  we consider this exposure to be minimal 
a change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact on our future earnings
