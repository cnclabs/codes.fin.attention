item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of  compared to net income of  in this decreased profitability was the result of various factors  each of which is more fully described below 
these factors include a decrease in net sales in  a slight decrease in gross profit margin derived in part from a change in customer sales mix  and an increase in other nonoperating expenses  which were driven by higher interest costs associated with higher short term borrowings throughout through the first nine months of  the company had generated net income of  the fourth quarter of  however  was negatively affected by several factors  each of which is described throughout the following discussion 
net sales in the fourth quarter of decreased  from the fourth quarter of  primarily reflecting the softness observed throughout the automotive replacement parts and original equipment markets 
cost of sales increased  from the fourth quarter of  primarily reflecting changes to the labor cost standards applied to inventory in the fourth quarter 
income tax expense for the fourth quarter of decreased only  whereas a larger decrease would have been expected as a result of the loss incurred in that quarter 
this is due to an increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance of approximately  related to foreign tax credits which management now anticipates  based on recent financial results  are likely to expire unutilized in future years 
the net sales and cost of sales items described above are the primary cause for the fourth quarter pre tax loss of  compared to a fourth quarter pre tax loss of  the fourth quarter net loss was  compared to a net loss of  for the same period in in response to the negative factors noted above  the company announced cost containment measures in the first quarter of these measures are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
results of operations net sales compared to net sales for decreased  or  from  in to  the decrease in net sales reflects sales declines in the domestic and canadian aftermarket and the private brand and original equipment markets  partially offset by a modest increase in the export volume 
the sales decreases in the domestic and canadian aftermarket reflect an industry wide softness in the automotive replacement parts industry 
the decreases in the private brand and original equipment markets reflect the loss of certain customers through market consolidation and a sustained downturn in the original equipment market 
in response to a decrease in export sales in  and to help offset these negative domestic sales factors in  the company focused on increasing sales in the export market 
as a result of this focus  the company realized a modest increase in export piston ring sales in the total sales decrease in also reflects a reduction of approximately  in casite additives sales 
prior to  casite sales were reflected in the company s financial statements 
in october  the company entered into a owned joint venture for the purpose of expanding its additives offerings through both increased global market penetration and an expansion of the product offerings under the casite name 
as a result  casite sales  beginning in  are recorded in the unconsolidated financial statements of the joint venture rather than through net sales within the company s financial statements 
as noted earlier  net sales in the fourth quarter of decreased  in comparison to the same period in this decrease reflects the continued softness in the domestic piston ring aftermarket that had begun in the third quarter of  combined with a sustained downturn in the original equipment market 
both of these events are considered temporary in nature 
the effects of the downturn in the original equipment market  however  will negatively affect the company s first quarter sales  as many original equipment manufacturers have implemented a series of plant shutdowns as a means of reducing their levels of inventory 
these shutdowns will result in reduced sales by the company to the original equipment market in the first quarter of casite product sales in the fourth quarter of amounted to approximately  and thus represent a portion of the decrease when comparing net sales in and compared to net sales for decreased  or  from the decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the company s export volume 
the export volume was negatively affected by specific political and economic factors in the foreign countries where the company conducts business  combined with the effects of the realignment of the distribution channel within one of the company s major foreign markets 
the net sales decrease also reflected slight reductions in volume in the company s domestic aftermarket and private brand and original equipment markets  offset by a sales increase in the canadian aftermarket 
cost of sales and gross profit compared to cost of sales for decreased  or  from  in to  the company s gross profit margin slightly decreased to in from in while the overall decrease in cost of sales is consistent with the decrease in net sales  several factors negatively affected the gross profit margin in during the last half of  the company experienced a change in its sales mix 
as noted earlier  domestic aftermarket sales were down in due to an overall softness in the replacement parts market 
sales in the domestic piston ring aftermarket have traditionally carried a higher gross profit margin in order to support the higher level of operating expenses that are necessary to support that volume 
export volume  as noted earlier  increased in as a result of the company s focus on this market 
the export volume has traditionally carried a lower gross profit margin than domestic sales as a result of the lower pricing offered due to the lower level of operating expenses not included in cost of sales that are required to service that volume 
the company s gross profit margin was also negatively affected by changes to the labor cost standards applied to inventory in the fourth quarter  as noted earlier 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed adjustments to the labor cost standards to reflect efficiencies obtained in its transition to a lean manufacturing environment 
this transition  while an on going effort during the past few years  was largely completed during the fourth quarter  at which time the company was first able to fully measure  and adjust the inventory for  the impact of its reduced labor costs 
any future cost of sales effects from this inventory driven absorption of labor efficiency gains will be reflected in cost of sales on a quarterly basis  as the company further develops and refines its manufacturing capabilities 
material costs remained relatively unchanged from the prior year average  with increases in cast iron costs offset by reductions in rolled steel costs 
labor costs increased slightly from the prior year average  with a labor cost increase resulting from the collective bargaining agreement  partially offset by the effects of the labor efficiencies noted above 
overhead costs decreased at a rate lower than the sales decrease due to the fixed nature of a large portion of those costs 
specifically  overhead costs relating to on going maintenance of plant equipment  and the tooling expense necessary to support a lean manufacturing environment  increased during the year  especially during the fourth quarter of expenses related to enhanced education programs also increased overhead costs during the fourth quarter of cost of sales for the fourth quarter of increased by  or  over the fourth quarter of this increase was primarily the result of the changes to the labor cost standards applied to inventory  as noted earlier 
the gross profit margin generated in the fourth quarter of was lower than the gross profit generated through the third quarter of  reflecting the negative effect of the labor cost changes noted above  combined with the sales mix change noted earlier  the increase in overhead expenses noted above  an increase in group health insurance costs and the absence of gross profit from casite sales in compared to cost of sales for increased  or  from this increase  along with a decrease in net sales  resulted in a gross profit margin decrease to in from in the increase in cost of sales and decrease in the gross profit margin were the result of several factors 
during  the company s cost of sales was negatively impacted by non recurring costs associated with the conversion and start up of various production processes 
this conversion negatively affected the company s production levels and  as a result  the company incurred additional labor and overhead costs throughout in an effort to improve these levels 
these additional costs were necessary in order to raise production levels to the point where customer order fill performance could be  and was  improved in material costs remained relatively unchanged from the prior year average 
the labor cost factor increased slightly as a result of the collective bargaining agreement 
however  labor costs decreased in total for the year  although at a slower rate than the relative decrease in net sales  thus contributing to the reduced gross profit margin 
overhead costs increased for as a result of the production items noted above  and the recognition of increased workers compensation costs related to a retroactive adjustment by the company s insurance carrier  combined with increased current insurance claims activity 
the increase in overhead costs  which were largely fixed in nature  also contributed to the reduced gross profit margin for the year 
operating expenses compared to total operating expenses for increased  or  from  in to  advertising expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase reflects increases in co op advertising costs and advertising support salaries  largely offset by decreases in printed material and trade advertising costs 
selling expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase reflects increases in salesmen s travel and various sales personnel and support costs  offset partially by a decrease in volume driven agents commissions 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  from the total 
this increase reflects increases in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  group health insurance  legal and professional fees  and property insurance costs  offset significantly by decreases in general personnel support costs 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable relates to write offs of specific customer accounts 
the increase in the group health insurance relates to increased claims activity throughout the year 
the increase in legal and professional fees is related to the company s retirees class action lawsuit described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the increased property insurance cost represents the deductible portion of an insured fire loss that took place in april within the finished goods storage area of the company s us production facility 
the effect of this event on the company s ability to service its customers  and its effect on earnings  has been minimal 
fourth quarter operating expenses were lower than the total primarily due to decreases in volume driven agents commissions  legal and professional fees and general personnel support costs  partially offset by increases in salesmen s travel  the provision for doubtful accounts receivable and group health insurance costs  as discussed above 
compared to total operating expenses for decreased  or  from advertising expenses decreased  or  from the total  reflecting a reduction in advertising support costs in  combined with the inclusion  in  of a biannual customer service tips manual 
selling expenses increased  or  from the total  as a result of increases in agent based commissions and salesmen s travel and sales promotion costs  offset by a slight decrease in sales support costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from the total  reflecting reductions in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable and salaried personnel costs  offset by slight increases in various administrative support costs 
the decrease also reflected the inclusion  in  of approximately  of severance costs related to staffing reductions 
other expenses compared to other expenses  net for increased by  over the net total 
this increase reflects the increased interest expense arising from the added reliance on the company s short term lines of credit throughout  offset slightly by the income recognized from the company s investment in the casite joint venture  which is recorded as other  net income 
there was no income recognized from the joint venture in fourth quarter other expenses  net increased  from the total 
this increase was the result of the same factors noted in the above discussion 
compared to other expenses  net for increased  over the net total 
this increase primarily reflected the higher interest expense associated with the restructuring of the company s long term debt obligations in late august of other expenses also reflected the interest income derived from funds generated by the filter operations sale which were held in escrow through september  and the gain on sale of obsolete plant equipment 
taxes on income the impact of income taxes on the reported results of the company is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recording of  of tax expense on a pre tax loss of  for primarily results from an increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance of approximately  this increase is related to foreign tax credits that management now anticipates  based on recent financial results  are likely to expire unutilized in future years 
the tax amount is also impacted by the effect of state income taxes and certain nondeductible expenses 
the and effective tax rates of and  respectively  are higher than the statutory federal tax rate of due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain nondeductible expenses 
the effective tax rate was also affected by the increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that were expected to expire unutilized in as of december   the company recorded net deferred income tax assets of  the major components include the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards of  and net accrued retirement and postretirement benefit obligations totaling  the realization of these recorded benefits is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in    and  if not previously utilized 
management has prepared projections of taxable income for future years indicating that the cumulative net operating loss carryforward is expected to be fully utilized by late the company further expects to be able to realize the deferred tax assets related to the retirement and postretirement benefit obligations as it pays these benefits 
such payments will constitute an expense that is deductible for tax reporting purposes over many future years 
during each of the ten years prior to when the recent net operating loss carryforwards arose  the company has been able to deduct these benefit payments for tax reporting purposes and reduce its tax liability accordingly 
as a result of the plan amendment to the retiree medical plan as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  current tax deductible payments are expected to exceed the annual expense recognition for financial reporting purposes  thus accelerating the absorption of the future periods tax benefit 
management believes that it is more likely than not that adequate levels of future income will be generated to absorb the net operating loss carryforwards  the deductible amounts related to the retirement and postretirement benefit obligations and the remaining net deductible temporary differences 
however  based on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards at december  which must be utilized before foreign tax credit carryforwards can be utilized  management believes that it is more likely than not that the foreign tax credits will go unutilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the total foreign tax credits of  at december  liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements continue to be for operating expenses such as labor costs and raw materials  and for funding capital expenditures and long term debt service 
historically  the company s primary sources of cash have been from operations and from bank borrowings 
in late march  the company entered into an agreement with its primary lender to amend the terms of its short and long term debt obligations 
the amendment increased the short term line available to the company from  to  modified the payment schedule of the company s long term debt obligation  and provided the primary lender with a security position in certain assets of the company 
details of this amendment are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in late december  the company s loan agreement was amended to increase the short term line from  to  while leaving the maturity date unchanged at september  due to the company s fourth quarter financial results  it was not in compliance with certain restrictive covenants contained in its loan agreement at december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company subsequently obtained a waiver from the bank for its noncompliance and further amended its loan agreement 
the amendment increases the short term line to  through october   at which time maximum borrowings revert to  and revises the maturity date from september  to may  the amendment also modifies the payment schedule of the company s long term debt obligation  requiring full payment by may  among other changes to the restrictive covenants  capital expenditures are limited to  per fiscal year and the company is prohibited from paying dividends and repurchasing its common stock through the revised loan agreement maturity date of may  as a result of these amendments  and based on an anticipated improvement in profitability  the company expects to generate sufficient future funds from operations and bank borrowings to fund its growth and operating needs 
total short term lines available to the company as of december  totaled  of which  was unused  and  respectively  after the march  amendment 
in an effort to minimize its floating rate debt exposure  the company is a party to an interest rate swap agreement essentially fixing the interest rate on that debt within a small range 
the rate will fluctuate within to depending upon certain company performance parameters 
as of december  the fixed rate on those borrowings was 
during  the company generated  of net cash from operating activities 
the realized depreciation  combined with decreases in accounts receivable  inventories  deferred income taxes and an increase in accounts payable and accruals  were partially offset by a decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decrease in accounts receivable reflects the timing of customer sales and the related payment terms associated with those sales 
the decrease in inventories reflects a reduction in inventory requirements in relation to customer demand 
the decrease in deferred income taxes primarily reflects the increase in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that management anticipates are likely to expire unutilized in future years 
the increase in accounts payable and accruals reflects an increase in general accounts payable  taxes  other and compensation  offset slightly by a decrease in miscellaneous payables 
the decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation reflects the excess of actual postretirement benefit claims paid over the actuarially determined annual expense 
the investing activities for reflect the company s continued support of its lean manufacturing environment 
the investing activities also reflect the previously discussed investment in a joint venture  in february  related to the casite brand additives products 
the financing activities reflect the working capital requirements that were primarily needed to fund the operating activity needs noted above 
the financing activities also reflect the amortization of the company s long term obligation that was amended in march  as discussed above  and the purchase and retirement of  shares of the company s common stock 
this stock repurchase was part of the common stock repurchase program that the company announced in february this program is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on february   the company announced that it had instituted a series of cost containment measures in an effort to reduce its operating expenses and improve its profitability 
the cost containment measures were in response to a continued softness in the domestic piston ring aftermarket and a downturn in the original equipment market 
the cost containment measures consisted of reductions in the salaried and hourly workforces and identification of reductions in various non payroll related expenses 
the workforce reductions did not result in material severance payments 
the company has also announced an indefinite suspension of its regular quarterly cash dividend and has identified certain assets for possible future sale in an effort to further improve its cash position 
the company does not anticipate a loss on the disposal of these assets 
during  the company generated  of net cash from operating activities 
the realized net income and depreciation  combined with decreases in accounts receivable  prepaid pension cost and deferred income taxes  were partially offset by increases in inventories and decreases in accounts payable and accruals and the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decrease in accounts receivable reflected the timing of customer sales and related payment terms associated with those sales 
the decrease in the prepaid pension cost reflected the recognition of the pension expense for the decrease in the net deferred income tax asset reflected the reduction of several deferred tax items  partially offset by the deferred tax effect of the net operating loss for tax purposes 
the increase in inventories reflected the company s continued efforts toward having sufficient product on hand in order to maintain adequate order fill for its customers 
the decrease in accounts payable and accruals primarily reflected the reduction in the compensation accrual  offset by slight increases in general accounts payable and miscellaneous payables 
the decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation reflected the excess of actual postretirement benefits paid over the actuarially determined annual expense 
the investing activities for reflected a decreased requirement for new capital equipment  as the company moved to finalize its full transition into a lean manufacturing environment 
the investing activities also reflected the proceeds from the sale of obsolete plant equipment 
the financing activities for reflected the working capital requirements that were primarily needed to fund the operating activity items noted above 
the financing activities also reflected the amortization of the company s long term debt obligation 
in late august  the company entered into a  long term debt agreement with its primary lender 
this agreement allowed the company to take advantage of favorable interest rate conditions 
borrowings under this long term debt agreement were used for several purposes including raising the company s defined benefit plans to funding levels that would alleviate the payment of the variable rate pbgc premiums  consolidating the remaining long term debt obligations  and paying down certain short term notes payable 
as a result of this agreement  the company s short term line with its primary lender was reduced from  to  this amount has subsequently been raised to  in accordance with the amended short and long term debt agreements described above 
during  the company used  of net cash for operating activities 
the realized net income  depreciation and decrease in deferred income taxes were offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid pension cost  and a decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation 
the decline in the deferred income tax asset was primarily the result of the additional funding of the company s defined benefit pension plans  and the partial utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase in accounts receivable and inventories reflected the additional working capital requirements that were necessary to support the higher sales level 
the increase in the prepaid pension cost of  reflected the funding of the company s defined benefit plans to specified limits 
as such  it did not have a direct effect on operations during excluding this item  net cash generated from operating activities amounted to  the investing activities for reflected the company s commitment to enhancing its production capabilities through the implementation of lean manufacturing principles 
investing activities also reflected the september release of escrowed funds relating to the sale of filter operations 
these funds were subsequently used to reduce short term notes payable 
financing activities reflected the increased reliance on short term borrowings to help satisfy increased working capital needs 
financing activities also reflected the proceeds from the new long term debt agreement and subsequent utilization of a portion of the proceeds to pay down short and long term debt 
dividends paid increased in due to the improved operating results 
as noted earlier in this discussion  the company has taken steps in february to reduce its operating expenses and improve its profitability and cash position 
the company is also committed to the implementation of lean manufacturing principles throughout the organization 
continued implementation and refinement of these principles should reduce the company s inventory levels  and thus enhance the company s cash flow now and in the future 
the combination of these two items should help improve the company s financial outlook in the near future 
litigation contingency as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on january   the company s retirees filed a class action lawsuit against the company as a result of the april amendment of the company s postretirement benefit plans 
the plans were amended principally to adjust the cost sharing provisions 
the suit alleges that the company denied class retirees and their dependents certain health insurance benefits to which the retirees had a vested right pursuant to the terms of the company s collective bargaining agreements to the present 
the company has denied any wrongdoing in this suit and intends to defend it and any related class certification vigorously 
minimal discovery has taken place to date in the lawsuit because the parties have been attempting to reach a settlement 
at this state  the prospect of settlement is uncertain 
furthermore  because the lawsuit is in its early stages  the company s ultimate success in prevailing against the retirees charges is uncertain 
if the retirees prevail  the company anticipates that a requirement to provide postretirement benefits at the pre amendment level would have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
new accounting standards emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  issued during  requires companies to record as revenue all amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling 
the classification of related shipping and handling costs  while not permitted to be netted against revenues  is an accounting policy decision required to be disclosed 
in accordance with eitf  shipping and handing costs incurred by the company are included in cost of sales

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  issued in june  requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge  the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june historically  the company has not entered into derivatives contracts for speculative purposes 
the company does periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings 
however  the fair value of such derivatives is not significant 
accordingly  the adoption of the new standard on january  did not materially affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements with the exception of historical matters  the matters discussed in this commentary and elsewhere in this form k include forward looking statements that describe the company s plans  objectives  goals  expectations or projections 
these forward looking statements are identifiable by words or phrases indicating that the company or management expects  anticipates  projects  plans or believes that a particular event may occur or will likely occur in the future  or similar statements 
in addition to other risks and uncertainties described in connection with the forward looking statements contained in this commentary  there are many important factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from the company s current expectations 
anticipated future sales are subject to competitive pressures from many sources 
as an example  future sales could be affected by consolidation within the automotive replacement parts industry  whereby the company could lose sales due to a competitor purchasing all of the assets of a current customer of the company 
future sales could also be affected by current and future political and economic factors in the foreign markets where the company conducts business 
cost of sales and operating expenses may be adversely affected by unexpected costs associated with various issues 
for example  future cost of sales could be affected by unexpected expenses related to the future maintenance of a lean manufacturing environment 
future operating expenses could also be affected  for example  by such items as unexpected large claims within the company s self funded group health insurance plan  increased retiree health insurance claim exposure as a result of an adverse court ruling on the current retiree health issue  or bad debt expenses related to deterioration in the credit worthiness of a customer

the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
