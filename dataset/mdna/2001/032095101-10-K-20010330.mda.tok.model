ebitda is not a defined term under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not an alternative to operating income or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
the company believes that ebitda provides additional information for determining its ability to meet future debt service requirements  however  ebitda does not reflect cash available to fund cash requirements 
the company s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for debt service  capital expenditures and product development activities 
the company s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its senior subordinated notes due notes

environmental matters subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol corporation in  amphenol and allied signal corporation allied  subsequently merged with honeywell international inc have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites 
amphenol and allied have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site 
the responsibility for costs incurred relating to these sites is apportioned between amphenol and allied based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition 
for sites covered by this agreement  to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition  allied is currently obligated to pay of the costs up to million and of the costs in excess of million 
at december   approximately million of the total costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement 
management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating  aluminum  copper  brass and steel used for contacts  shells and cable  and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies  inserts and cable 
in general  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
risk management the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions 
in other cases involving us export sales  raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale  such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations  and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital  although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company s worldwide operations 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had interest rate protection in the form of such swaps that effectively fixed the company s libor interest rate on million of floating rate bank debt at 
at december   the three month libor rate was 
these swap agreements expire in a change in the libor interest rate at december  would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 
million 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
