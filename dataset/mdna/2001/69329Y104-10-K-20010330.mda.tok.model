item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in general  we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve sustained profitability 
our expenses have generally exceeded revenues 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses may increase because of the extensive resource commitments required to achieve regulatory approval and commercial success for any individual product 
for example  over the next several years  we will incur substantial additional expenses as we continue to develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in new research areas and improve and expand our manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
since we or our collaborative partners or licensees may not be able to successfully develop additional products  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture products at an acceptable cost and with appropriate quality  or successfully market such products with desired margins  we may never achieve sustained profitable operations 
the amount of net losses and the time required to reach sustained profitability are highly uncertain 
although we have had some profitable reporting periods  we may be unable to achieve sustained profitability 
our commitment of resources to the continued development of our products will require significant additional funds for development 
our operating expenses may also increase as some of our earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as we invest in additional manufacturing capacity  as we defend or prosecute our patents and patent applications  and as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  product candidates or businesses 
in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or patent licensing or humanization agreements  significant royalties on sales of products licensed under our intellectual property rights  product sales or other uncertain sources of revenue  we will incur substantial operating losses 
our revenues  expenses and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods 
our revenues have varied in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate considerably from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
as a result  our revenues in any period may not be predictive of revenues in any subsequent period 
our royalty revenues may be unpredictable and may fluctuate since they depend upon the seasonality of sales of licensed products  the existence of competing products  the marketing efforts of our licensees  potential reductions in royalties payable to us due to credits for prior payments to us  the timing of royalty reports  some of which are required quarterly and others semi annually  our method of accounting for royalty revenues from our licensees  and our ability to successfully defend and enforce our patents 
other revenue may also be unpredictable and may fluctuate due to the timing of payments of non recurring licensing and signing fees  payments for manufacturing and clinical development services and payments for the achievement of milestones under new and existing collaborative  humanization  and patent licensing agreements 
revenue historically recognized under our prior agreements may not be an indicator of revenue from any future collaborations 
in addition  our expenses may be unpredictable and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenses  which may include payments owed by us and to us under collaborative agreements for reimbursement of expenses and which are reported under our policy during the quarter in which such expenses are reported to us or to our collaborative partners and agreed to by us or our partners 
we receive royalty revenues on sales of the product synagis 
this product has higher sales in the fall and winter  which to date have resulted in much higher royalties paid to us in our first and second quarters than in other quarters 
the seasonality of synagis sales could contribute to fluctuation of our revenues from quarter to quarter 
results of operations years ended december   and our total revenues were million in as compared to million in and million in total revenue under agreements with third parties represented million  million and million of total revenues in  and  respectively 
revenue under agreements with third parties include royalties  licensing and signing fees  payments recognized under humanization agreements  milestone payments  research and development reimbursement funding  payments for manufacturing services and license maintenance fees 
the increase in total revenue under agreements with third parties in from the prior years was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties during the period 
of the amounts we expended for research and development  million in  million in and million in represented third party funded research and development activities not including licensing and signing fees  milestone payments and product sales 
interest and other income increased to million in from and million in and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily attributable to the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities balances as a result of our public offering of common stock in the second half of which raised approximately in net proceeds and the sale of million convertible subordinated notes in february total costs and expenses increased to million in from million in and million in research and development expenses in increased to million from million in and million in the increase in costs and expenses as compared to and was primarily a result of the addition of staff  the expansion of clinical development programs and research and pharmaceutical development capabilities  including support for both clinical development and manufacturing process development  and payments related to manufacturing of the humanized anti il antibody 
general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in and million in these increases were primarily the result of increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our expanding operations including pre marketing expenses associated with our clinical development program 
interest expense increased in to million from million in and zero in the increase is primarily due to the interest expense associated with our convertible subordinated notes issued in february liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity and debt securities  revenue under agreements with third parties and interest income on invested capital 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the aggregate of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash provided by our operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used of approximately million in and million in the change was primarily due to our net income in  changes in working capital and other assets as compared to our net losses and changes in working capital in and as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash used in our investing activities for the year ended december  was million and million in as compared to net cash provided by our investing activities of million in the change in was primarily the result of our reinvestment activities associated with the purchases of short and long term investments 
as set forth in the statements of cash flows  net cash provided by our financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the change in was primarily the result our public offering of common stock in the second half of which raised approximately million in net proceeds and the sale of million convertible subordinated notes in february our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  royalties from sales of products of third party licensees  including synagis  herceptin  zenapax and mylotarg  our ability to enter into additional collaborative  humanization and patent licensing arrangements  progress of product candidates in clinical trials  the ability of our licensees to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market products licensed under our patents  the continued or additional support by our collaborative partners or other third parties of research and development efforts and clinical trials  investment in existing and new research and development programs  time required to gain regulatory approvals  resources we devote to self funded products  manufacturing facilities and methods and advanced technologies  our ability to obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative arrangements  our continued development of internal marketing and sales capabilities  the demand for our potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by us  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize our potential products we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders 
item a 
market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million
