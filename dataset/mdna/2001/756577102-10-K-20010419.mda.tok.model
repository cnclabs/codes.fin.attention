the use of our redhat

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue is also due to pti s decreasing reliance upon hardware resale revenues  as these revenues generate significantly lower margins than do the company s other sources of revenues

liquidity and capital resources we have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings  and from cash flows from operations 
at february   we had total cash and investments of million  which is comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of short term  fixed income investments and million of long term  fixed income investments

we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations and staffing and the expansion of our services operation and acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to 
fund our domestic and international expansion  
enhance our redhat 
com web site  
expanding our product offerings  
improve and extend our service offerings  
pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances  
make possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  and 
expand our sales and marketing programs and conduct more aggressive brand promotions 
we believe that the net proceeds from our public offerings of common stock in august and february  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we may need to raise additional funds  however  in order to fund more rapid expansion 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  if convertible  could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot guarantee that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all

year compliance year readiness disclosure by the end of  we had evaluated our year readiness in preparation for issues that could result from computer programs being written using two digits to define the applicable year rather than four to define the applicable year and century 
we believe that we were prepared for the transition to the year and did not experience any significant year problems with respect to our products  third party products that we bundle with official red hat linux or our internal management information systems or other systems  applications or infrastructure 
since january   our internal management information systems and non information systems have functioned properly 
in addition  we have not experienced any material year issues related to our interaction with third parties 
we have not experienced any material disruption in our ability to provide our products and services to our customers  collect payments or report accurate data to management or any other business interruptions due to year issues 
we will continue to monitor our products and systems and those of third parties with whom we have material business relationships to ensure that no unexpected year issues develop 
factors affecting future results risks related to our linux based open source business model our open source software business model is unproven 
we have not demonstrated the success of our open source business model  which gives our customers the right to freely copy and distribute our software 
no other company has built a successful open source business 
few open source software products have gained widespread commercial acceptance partly due to the lack of viable open source industry participants to offer adequate service and support on a long term basis 
in addition  open source vendors are not able to provide industry standard warranties and indemnities for their products  since these products have been developed largely by independent parties over whom open source vendors exercise no control or supervision 
if open source software should fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  we would not be able to sustain our revenue growth and our business could fail 
we depend on the support of linux developers not employed by the us to release major product upgrades and maintain market share 
we may not be able to release major product upgrades of official red hat linux on a timely basis because the heart of official red hat linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of independent engineers are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel or if mr 
torvalds or other prominent linux developers  such as alan cox  david miller or stephen tweedie  were to join one of our competitors or no longer work on the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves 
we cannot predict whether enhancements to the kernel would be available from reliable alternative sources 
we could be forced to rely to a greater extent on our own development efforts  which would increase our development expenses and may delay our product release and upgrade schedules 
in addition  any failure on the part of the kernel developers to further develop and enhance the kernel could stifle the development of additional linux based applications 
we may not be able to effectively assemble and test our software because it consists largely of code developed by independent third parties over whom we exercise no control  which could result in unreliable products and damage to our reputation 
official red hat linux  in compressed form  consists of approximately gigabytes of code 
of that total  in excess of  megabytes have been developed by independent third parties  including approximately megabytes of code contained in the linux kernel 
included within the gigabytes of code are more than distinct software components developed by thousands of individual programmers which we must assemble and test before we can release a new version of official red hat linux 
if these components are not reliable  official red hat linux could fail  resulting in serious damage to our reputation and potential litigation 
although we attempt to assemble only the best available components  we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify the highest quality and most reliable components or successfully assemble and test them 
in addition  if these components were no longer available  we would have to develop them ourselves  which would significantly increase our development expenses 
the scarcity of software applications for linux based operating systems could prevent commercial adoption of our products 
our products will not gain widespread commercial adoption until there are more third party software applications designed to operate on linux based operating systems 
these applications include word processors  databases  accounting packages  spreadsheets  e mail programs  internet browsers  presentation and graphics software and personal productivity applications 
we intend to encourage the development of additional applications that operate on linux based operating systems by attracting third party developers to the linux platform  by providing open source tools to create these applications and by maintaining our existing developer relationships through marketing and technical support for third party developers 
if we are not successful in achieving these goals  however  our products will not gain widespread commercial acceptance and we will not be able to maintain our product sales growth 
we may not be able to generate revenue from sales of official red hat linux if users can more quickly download it from the internet 
anyone can download a free copy of official red hat linux from the internet 
however  because this download can take up to hours using a standard telephone connection  many of our users choose to buy the shrink wrapped version of official red hat linux 
if hardware and data transmission technology advances in the future to the point where increased bandwidth allows users to more quickly download our products from the internet  users may no longer choose to purchase official red hat linux 
this could lead to a significant loss of product revenue 
we may not succeed in shifting our business focus from traditional shrink wrapped software sales to offering subscription based product and services offerings 
we are focusing our sales and marketing efforts on providing subscription based products and services as opposed to relying on sales of shrink wrapped software 
this change has required us to expend significant financial and managerial resources and may ultimately prove unsuccessful 
the failure to successfully implement this transition of our sales model could materially adversely affect our operating results 
our customers may find it difficult to install and implement official red hat linux  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
installation and implementation of official red hat linux often involves a significant commitment of resources  financial and otherwise  by our customers 
this process can be lengthy due to the size and complexity of our products and the need to purchase and install new applications 
the failure by us to attract and retain services personnel to support our customers  the failure of companies with which we have strategic alliances to commit sufficient resources towards the installation and implementation of our products  or a delay in implementation for any other reason could result in dissatisfied customers 
this could damage our reputation and the red hat brand and result in decreased revenue 
we may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development  which could reduce the market appeal of our products and damage our reputation 
we do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology 
historically  different groups of open source software programmers have competed with each other to develop new technology 
typically one of those groups develops the technology that becomes more widely used than that developed by others 
if we adopt new technology and incorporate it into our products  and competing technology becomes more widely used  the market appeal of our products may be reduced  which could harm our reputation  diminish the red hat brand and result in decreased revenue 
risks related to our financial results and condition our limited operating history in the new and developing market for linux based operating systems makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
red hat was formed in march we began offering official red hat linux in october our limited operating history and the developing market for linux based operating systems makes it difficult to evaluate the risks and uncertainties that we face 
our failure to address these risks and uncertainties could cause our business results to suffer and result in the loss of all or part of your investment 
we have limited combined operating history with the companies we have acquired since our initial public offering and may have difficulty integrating these businesses 
the successful integration of the operations  products  services and personnel of red hat and the seven companies we have acquired since our initial public offering cygnus solutions  hell s kitchen systems  inc  bluecurve  inc  wirespeed communications corporation  cnet software  inc akopia  inc  and planning technologies  inc is important to the future financial performance of the combined enterprise 
the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions may not be achieved unless  among other things  the operations  products  services and personnel of the acquired companies are successfully combined with those of red hat in a timely and efficient manner 
integration of these companies operations  products  services and personnel may be hampered because  among other things 
the products and services offered by each of the acquired companies and red hat are highly complex and have been developed independently  
integration of the product lines of red hat and each of the acquired companies will require the coordination of separate development and engineering teams from each company  and 
the employees and management of the acquired companies and red hat are located in disparate geographical regions 
in addition  the costs associated with integrating these companies operations  products  services and personnel may be substantial and could include  among other things 
employee redeployment or relocation  and 
the combination of research and development teams and processes 
any of these difficulties and costs encountered in the transition process  could divert the attention of management  and could have an adverse impact on the revenues and operating results of the combined enterprise 
we expect to incur substantial losses on a gaap basis for the foreseeable future 
we have incurred operating losses in six of our previous seven fiscal years  including our most recent fiscal year ended february  we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future  as we substantially increase our sales and marketing  research and development and administrative expenses 
in addition  we are investing considerable resources in our red hat network initiative and to expand our professional services offerings 
as a result  we cannot be certain when or if we will achieve sustained profitability 
failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations 
you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations as an indication of our future results because they fluctuate significantly and are difficult to forecast 
due to our limited combined operating history and the unpredictability of our business  our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to forecast 
we base our current and projected future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenue 
our expenses are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenue falls short of our expectations 
accordingly  a revenue shortfall in a particular quarter would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
our future operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly 
we may not be able to effectively attract additional enterprise customers and preserve relationships with current enterprise customers  which could adversely affect revenue 
historically  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on product sales to individuals 
we have recently  however  begun to focus our efforts on expanding our enterprise customer base 
to this end  we have invested extensively to attract enterprise customers 
these enterprise customers expect diverse and extensive service programs  and if we are unable to continue to successfully expand and enhance our service offerings  we may not be able to meet these customers needs or attract new customers  and  consequently  our revenue would suffer 
our failure to update and modernize our internal systems  procedures and controls may prevent the implementation of our business strategies in a rapidly evolving market and may constrain our future growth 
our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  which were adequate for a small private company  are becoming outdated as we grow 
since march  we have increased the number of employees more than tenfold 
to accommodate this growth  we have evaluated our financial and operational systems  procedures and controls 
although we have revised or are in the process of revising and updating most of them  if we continue our rapid growth  we may not be able to improve our transaction processing and reporting systems and procedures  or expand and train our expanding workforce quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our markets 
in addition  failure to quickly replace obsolete systems  procedures and controls could impede our management s decision making abilities 
this  in turn  may impair our ability to pursue business opportunities and may hamper future growth 
we may not be able to generate enough additional revenue from our international expansion to offset the costs associated with establishing and maintaining foreign operations 
a key component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence in foreign markets 
we have recently established subsidiaries or offices in canada  ireland  the united kingdom  germany  italy  japan  france  singapore and australia  and are considering further expansion worldwide 
we may also enter other markets as opportunities arise 
it will be costly to establish international facilities and operations  promote our brand internationally  and develop localized web sites and other systems 
revenue from international activities may not offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign operations 
in addition  because we have little experience in marketing and distributing products or services for these markets  we may not benefit from any first to market advantages 
our management team may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies because it has only recently begun to work together 
our business is highly dependent on the ability of our management to work together effectively to meet the demands of our growth 
several members of our senior management have been employed by us for a relatively short period of time 
these individuals have not previously worked together as a management team 
the failure of our management team to work together effectively could prevent efficient decision making by our executive team  affecting product development and sales and marketing efforts  which would negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on our key personnel 
our future success depends on the continued services of a number of key officers  including our chief executive officer and president  matthew j 
szulik  our chief operating officer  timothy j 
buckley  our chief technical officer  michael tiemann  our chief financial officer  kevin b 
thompson  and our chief marketing officer  james neiser 
the loss of the technical knowledge and industry expertise of any of these people could seriously impede our success 
moreover  the loss of one or a group of our key employees  particularly to a competitor  and any resulting loss of customers could reduce our market share and diminish the red hat brand 
with our declining stock price we may have increased difficulty in attracting and retaining highly skilled employees 
as with most technology companies  a key component of our compensation package for our employees is stock options 
with the decline in our stock price  many of the options granted in the last months are now out of the money 
in order to retain our highly skilled workforce  we may be compelled to grant new options 
if such new options are granted  they are likely to have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we may lack the financial and operational resources needed to increase our market share and compete effectively with microsoft  other established operating systems developers  software development tools developers and other service and support providers 
in the market for operating systems  we face significant competition from larger companies with greater financial resources and name recognition than we have 
these competitors  which offer hardware independent multi user operating systems for intel platforms and or unix based operating systems  include microsoft  novell  ibm  sun microsystems  the santa cruz operation  at t  compaq  hewlett packard  olivetti and unisys 
some of these competitors currently  or may in the future  produce and market open source operating systems 
we also face competition in the market for software development tools and operating systems for special purpose computing  including embedded systems 
our competitors in this market  some of which have greater market share than we do  include wind river systems  integrated systems incorporated  green hills software  and the metrowerks subsidiary of motorola 
some of these companies currently produce or use open source software as part of their product offerings 
we may not be able to compete effectively in this market if customers choose proprietary solutions 
if the demand for open source solutions in this market expands  however  we could lose market share as existing competitors reposition or new companies emerge to address the opportunity 
as we increase our services offerings  we may face competition from larger and more capable companies that currently service and support the linux operating system as well as other operating systems  particularly unix based operating systems  due to the fact that linux and unix based operating systems share many common features 
these companies  including ibm and hewlett packard  may be able to leverage their existing service organizations and provide higher levels of support on a more cost effective basis than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully with these current or potential competitors 
we may not be able to match the promotional activities and pricing policies offered by other suppliers of linux based and other open source operating systems  which could result in a loss of market share 
in the new and rapidly evolving market for linux based operating systems  we face intense competition from a number of other suppliers of linux based operating systems 
we also face competition to a lesser extent from developers of non linux based open source operating systems such as bsd based operating systems 
bsd based operating systems such as freebsd  netbsd and openbsd are open source operating systems produced by communities of developers working together via the internet  and which are published and distributed by walnut creek cd rom  among others 
we expect competition in broader open source operating systems and the linux based operating systems market to intensify 
in addition  companies like sun microsystems and ibm  which are more established and have larger customer bases than we do  have indicated a growing interest in the market for linux based operating systems 
with the recent acquisition of bsdi by wind river systems  we will face increased competition in providing open source solutions in the embedded space 
these companies may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and offer more attractive terms to their customers than we can 
furthermore  because linux based operating systems can be downloaded from the internet for free or purchased at a nominal cost and modified and re sold with few restrictions  traditional barriers to entry are minimal 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among existing competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading companies  we may not be able to attract and retain a larger customer base 
our success depends on our ability to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading hardware manufacturers  distributors  software vendors and enterprise solutions providers 
these relationships allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
we may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on attractive terms 
in addition  our existing strategic relationships do not  and any future strategic relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
as a result  the companies with which we have strategic alliances are free to pursue alternative technologies and to develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our products and services  either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
moreover  we cannot guarantee that the companies with which we have strategic relationships will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
we may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we will encounter as our international operations expand 
as we expand our international operations  we will face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas 
for example 
we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business  
fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results  
we may not be able to repatriate the earnings of our foreign operations  
we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws with which we are not familiar  
we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  
reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world could negatively impact the operating results of our foreign operations  
export controls could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets  
multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations  
changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries  and 
economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets 
expanding our services business will be costly and may not result in any benefit to us 
we have expanded our strategic focus to place additional emphasis on consulting  custom engineering and development  education and support services 
we cannot be certain that our customers will engage our professional services organization to assist with support  consulting  custom development  training and implementation of our products 
we also cannot be certain that we can attract or retain a sufficient number of the highly qualified services personnel that the expansion of our services business will need 
in addition  this expansion has required  and will continue to require  significant additional expenses and development  financial and operational resources 
the need for these additional resources will place further strain on our management  financial and operational resources and may make it more difficult for us to achieve and maintain profitability 
attempts to expand by means of business combinations and strategic alliances may not be successful and may harm our operational efficiency  financial performance and relationships with employees and third parties 
we may continue to expand our operations or market presence by entering into additional business combinations  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with hardware manufacturers  software vendors  internet companies  open source software developers or other companies both in the united states and internationally 
our ability to expand in this way may be limited due to the many financial and operational risks accompanying these transactions 
for example 
we may have difficulty assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  
our business may be disrupted by the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions  
we may have problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel from acquired companies  
we may experience one time in process research and development charges and ongoing expenses associated with amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  
our stockholders will suffer dilution if we issue equity to fund these transactions  
acquired businesses may initially be unprofitable resulting in our assumption of operating losses and increased expenses  
our reputation may be harmed if the open source development community does not approve of these transactions  
our relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners may be weakened or terminated as a result of these transactions  and 
our investment activities  particularly with respect to emerging growth technology companies  are inherently risky and we may not realize any benefit from such activities 
risks related to our internet strategy we may fail to promote and enhance our web site effectively  which may prevent us from attracting new visitors  advertisers or electronic commerce partners to our web site 
in order to attract and retain internet users  service customers  and electronic commerce partners  we intend to substantially increase our expenditures for enhancing and further developing our web site 
our success in promoting and enhancing the redhat 
com web site will also depend on our ability to provide high quality service delivery  content  features and functionality 
if we fail to promote our web site successfully or if visitors to our web site or customers do not perceive our services to be useful  current or of high quality  our ability to generate revenue from our web site will be significantly impaired 
visitors to our web site could experience delays and decreased performance during periods of heavy traffic  which could result in dissatisfaction with our web site and damage to our reputation 
our web site must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
our web site has in the past experienced slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences have not had a material impact on our business 
these types of occurrences in the future  however  could materially adversely affect our reputation and brand name and could cause users to perceive our web site as not functioning properly 
under these circumstances  our users might choose another web site or other methods to obtain linux based operating systems  services  or linux related information 
our internet strategy will fail if the infrastructure of the internet is not continually developed and maintained 
the success of our internet strategy will depend in large part on the continued development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet 
because global commerce and the online exchange of information is new and evolving  we cannot predict with any certainty that the internet will be a viable commercial marketplace in the long term 
the internet has experienced  and we expect it to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience an increased number of users  frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users  it may not be able to support the demands placed upon it by this growth  and its performance and reliability may suffer 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and could face similar outages and delays in the future 
any outage or delay could affect the level of internet usage  as well as the volume of traffic on our web site 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to increased governmental regulation and delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity 
if the necessary infrastructure  standards or protocols or complementary products  services or facilities are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  our internet strategy will not succeed 
we are vulnerable to unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures  which may result in reduced visitor traffic on our web site  decreased revenue and harm to our reputation 
substantially all of our communications hardware and other hardware related to our web site is located at our facilities  although we have back up and co location hardware for our web site located at third party facilities 
fire  floods  hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems 
in addition  although we have implemented network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  electronic break ins  human error and other similar disruptive problems which could adversely affect our systems and web site 
although we try to prevent unauthorized access to our systems  we cannot eliminate this risk entirely 
we could lose revenue and suffer damage to our reputation if our systems were affected by any of these occurrences 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures or interruptions in our systems 
we do not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
risks related to legal uncertainty we could be prevented from selling or developing our products if the gnu general public license and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable 
the linux kernel and the official red hat linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
we know of no circumstance under which these licenses have been challenged or interpreted in court 
accordingly  it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in the event that someone were to file a claim asserting proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our products 
our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct  delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors have been and may continue to be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that most of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
if errors are discovered  we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and yet may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of linux based operating systems and other open source software products 
in addition  failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim 
these claims  even if unsuccessful  could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights particularly because our products are comprised of many distinct software components developed by thousands of independent parties 
we may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that most of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
claims of infringement could require us to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products 
in addition  an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property  or the use of significant resources to defend against this type of claim  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and harm our reputation 
our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights 
our most valuable intellectual property is our collection of trademarks 
the protective steps we have taken in the past have been  and may in the future continue to be  inadequate to deter misappropriation of our trademark rights 
although we do not believe that we have suffered any material harm from misappropriation to date  we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our trademark rights 
we have registered some of our trademarks in the united states  europe and australia and have other trademark applications pending in the united states  europe  australia  canada  europe and japan 
effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy the red hat brand and impair our ability to compete effectively 
furthermore  defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
we may be sued as a result of information published or posted on or accessible from our redhat 
com web site 
we may be subjected to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other claims relating to the information we publish on our web site 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services in the past  and can be costly to defend 
we may also be subjected to claims based on content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or through content and materials that may be posted by visitors to our web site 
we believe that the scope and amount of our commercial and general liability insurance is appropriate  given our current financial position 
however  this insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims 
we have not been a party to any lawsuit of this type to date 
risks related to the market for our common stock our stock price has been extremely volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as 
actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  
new products or services offered by red hat or our competitors  
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  
conditions or trends in the internet  linux and software industries  
changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other internet  linux and software industries  
announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  
additions or departures of key personnel  
sales of common stock  and 
other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet related and technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in addition  broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of red hat s investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
the following table presents the fair value balances of the company s cash equivalents and short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of february  year ended in thousands february  february  february  total cash equivalents   average interest rate investments     average interest rates red hat did not hold derivative financial instruments as of february   and has never held such investments in the past 
foreign currency risk approximately of the company s fiscal revenues were generated by sales outside the united states 
the company is exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of the company s non us operations are translated into non us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates  and revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month the transactions occur 
unrealized translation gains and losses will be included as an adjustment to stockholders equity
