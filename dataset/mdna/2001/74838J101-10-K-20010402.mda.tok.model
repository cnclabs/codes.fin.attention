many possible events or factors could affect our future financial results and performance  such that our actual results and performance may differ materially

differences in operating results may arise as a result of a number of factors including  without limitation  seasonality  adverse changes in the competitive and economic conditions in domestic and international markets  actions of our major distributors  manufacturing and production delays or difficulties  adverse actions or delays in product reviews by the fda and the lower acceptance of our new products than forecast 
forward looking statements typically are identified by the use of terms such as may  will  should  might  expect  anticipate  estimate and similar words  although some forward looking statements are expressed differently

over the counter otc  original equipment manufacture oem and clinical lab sales collectively increased for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the change for the nine months ended december  was due to sales of a partnered retail store brand program for distribution of pregnancy tests that commenced in late and was in place for the full nine month period ended december   offset in part by the loss of an otc contract 
international sales increased by for the nine months ended december  over the same period in this increase in international sales is primarily due to the acquisition of metra and its three european subsidiaries 
oem product sales increased dramatically in the year ended march  due to the manufacture of veterinary products under contract for the benefit of a third party for the full year compared to only a few months in fiscal  as well as to the launch of a new partnered retail store brand program for distribution of pregnancy tests

gross profit gross profit increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin decreased to for the twelve months ended december  from for the same period in the dollar increase was primarily due to overall sales growth partially offset by an inventory write down of approximately million in the twelve months ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended december  increased as a percent of sales from the same period in this increase in profit margin was due to our improvement in our procedures for the procurement of raw materials and other initiatives intended to increase manufacturing efficiency and to reduce overall product costs 
in addition  we also reviewed our credit and rebate policies to identify potential increases in product sale profitability 
gross profit declined approximately two percentage points to of sales for the year ended march  from the prior year level 
the shift in product mix toward sales of our oem pregnancy tests  which provide a lower direct margin contribution  increased direct costs as a percent of sales 
manufacturing overhead cost increases for the year ended march  related to increased production capacity  the purchase of automation equipment  and the addition of purchasing and engineering support staff 
research and development expense research and development expense decreased to million for the the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in research and development expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the twelve months ended december  from for the same period in the percentage decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in net sales  partially offset by an estimated charge for certain contract costs including an estimated charge for costs to be incurred in excess of amounts expected to be realized  related to the development of two diagnostic tests to detect herpes simplex virus 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to research and development for the foreseeable future

the glaxo influenza a and b and hsv programs  were the largest of these projects

sales and marketing efficiencies improved for the year ended march  as the overall cost declined to of sales 
domestic otc and oem sales and marketing expenses continued to decline as these expenses were assumed by outside distributors 
these savings partially offset the lower margin on domestic otc oem products from reduced sales prices under these distribution agreements 
international sales and marketing expenses declined due to the closure of our european subsidiaries and represented approximately of total international sales 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to for the twelve months ended december  from for the same period in these increases were primarily due to increases in infrastructure  including investor relations  business development and information technology

general and administrative expense increased significantly for the year ended march  this increase contained million of non recurring restructuring costs  including employee severance costs  legal fees and consulting costs 
without these non recurring costs  general and administrative costs would have decreased by approximately million from the year ended march  acquired in process research and develpment in connection with our acquisitions of litmus in december and metra in july  we acquired research and development projects that had not reached technical feasibility and had no probable alternative future uses 
the amounts allocated to purchased in process research and development for the acquisitions were based on independent third party valuations  and were expensed as of the date of the acquisitions

extraordinary item extraordinary loss for the nine months ended december  was million and consisted of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the prepayment of debt related to one of our facilities 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we changed our accounting policies to implement the effects of the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million during fiscal year we implemented sab in the fourth quarter of by restating our first three quarters of see accompanying consolidating financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of december  was principally due to costs associated with the acquisition of litmus and the purchase of manufacturing and other equipment 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness included million under capital leases primarily our san diego facility and million of borrowing under lines of credit 
our primary line of credit  of which million was outstanding as of december   provides for a maximum availability of million  bore interest at at december   matures in june and is secured by our inventory  accounts receivable and fixed assets 
this line of credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
as of december  we were not in compliance with certain of these covenants  and therefore a waiver  as of december   was obtained from the financial institution 
the company and the lender are in process of negotiating an amendment to the agreement which  among other things  will modify the covenants 
as of december   and as part of the litmus acquisition  million was outstanding under a million line of credit with a financial institution and was subsequently paid in full in march we plan approximately million in capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
we have no material commitments with respect to such planned expenditures as of the date of this filing 
our principal requirements for cash are for working capital  including capital equipment additions 
cash requirements are expected to be funded by the results of operations and borrowings under our line of credit 
we also intend to continue searching for acquisition and technology licensing candidates 
as such  we may need to incur additional debt  or sell additional equity  to successfully complete these acquisitions 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which we generate cash in operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on the current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet operating needs during the next twelve months

sfas no 
requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
these new standards are effective beginning with our first quarter of  we have determined that adoption of both sfas and sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the financial accounting standards board has issued fin no

fin affects awards and modifications made after december  we believe that our accounting policies comply with the applicable provisions of fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the risk of future currency exchange rate fluctuations  which is accounted for as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
therefore  changes from reporting period to reporting period in the exchange rates between various foreign currencies and the us dollar have had and will continue to have an impact on the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity reported by the company  and such effect may be material in any individual reporting period 
the fair market value of floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates
