item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a health care services company focused on acquiring and operating hospitals in attractive non urban markets in the united states 
as of december   we owned or leased general acute care hospitals in nine states with a total of  licensed beds  and managed hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds 
our company was founded in february by golder  thoma  cressey  rauner fund iv  lp and martin s 
rash to acquire and operate hospitals in attractive non urban markets 
we acquired our first hospital  memorial mother frances hospital in palestine  texas  in july in december  we acquired brim  inc in a transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
therefore  the assets and liabilities of brim were recorded at fair value as required by the purchase method of accounting  and the operations of brim were reflected in the operations of the combined enterprise from the date of acquisition 
because we had been in existence for less than a year at december   and because brim had been in existence for several years  we are considered the successor to brim s operations 
impact of acquisitions and divestitures an integral part of our strategy is to acquire non urban acute care hospitals 
because of the financial impact of our recent acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the fiscal periods presented 
in addition  due to the relatively small number of owned and leased hospitals  each hospital acquisition can materially affect our overall operating performance 
upon the acquisition of a hospital  we typically take a number of steps to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions may be offset by cost increases to expand services  strengthen medical staff and improve market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins generally do not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of a newly acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as we make additional hospital acquisitions  we expect that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals and the allocation of corporate overhead among a larger number of hospitals 
we may also divest certain hospitals in the future if we determine a hospital no longer fits within our strategy 
acquisitions in may  we acquired havasu regional medical center in lake havasu city  arizona  for approximately million 
in june  we acquired elko general hospital in elko  nevada for a purchase price of approximately million 
to finance these acquisitions  we borrowed million and million  respectively  under our revolving credit facility 
the results of operations include eight months of operations for havasu regional medical center and six and one half months of operations for elko general hospital 
acquisitions in february  we entered into a special services agreement for the lease of eunice community medical center in eunice  louisiana  by purchasing assets totaling million and assuming certain liabilities and entering into a ten year lease agreement  with a five year renewal option  totaling million 
we are obligated under the lease to construct a replacement facility currently estimated to cost approximately million at such time as the net patient service revenue of the hospital reaches a pre determined level 
the lease will terminate at the time the replacement facility commences operations 
in april  we acquired assets totaling million and assumed liabilities totaling million of glades general hospital in belle glade  florida 
to finance this acquisition  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
we are obligated under the asset purchase agreement to build a replacement hospital following the fifth year after the closing  at a cost of not less than million  contingent upon the hospital meeting certain financial targets following the closing 
in june  we acquired assets totaling million and assumed certain liabilities totaling million of doctors hospital of opelousas in opelousas  louisiana 
to finance this acquisition  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
in october  we acquired assets totaling million and assumed liabilities totaling million of trinity valley medical center in palestine  texas and minden medical center in minden  louisiana 
to finance the acquisition  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
following the acquisition  we merged trinity valley medical center into memorial mother frances hospital  a hospital that we already owned in palestine  texas  and changed the name of the hospital to palestine regional medical center 
the results of operations include the results of trinity valley medical center and minden medical center effective october   doctors hospital of opelousas effective june   glades general hospital effective may   and eunice community medical center effective april  acquisitions in february  we acquired  through a long term capital lease agreement  the assets and business of the bed city of ennis hospital from the city of ennis  texas 
the aggregate rental payments required under the thirty year lease total million  including a prepayment of million 
to finance the lease prepayment  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
in april  we acquired  through a long term capital lease agreement  the assets and business of the bed bolivar medical center in cleveland  mississippi  from bolivar county 
aggregate payments under the forty year lease total million  and were prepaid at the date of acquisition 
to finance the prepaid lease payment and the purchase of working capital  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
the results of operations include the results of city of ennis hospital effective march   and bolivar medical center effective may  all of the acquisitions described above were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
our owned and leased hospitals accounted for   and of our net operating revenue in  and  respectively 
recent dispositions in october  we sold substantially all of the assets of ojai valley community hospital  a bed general acute care facility located in ojai  california  to the ojai valley community hospital foundation 
the sale price for the hospital was approximately million  including working capital 
after application of tax benefits  we recorded a loss on the sale of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in december   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of general hospital  a bed acute care hospital located in eureka  california  to st 
joseph health systems 
the sale price for the hospital was million plus approximately million for working capital  subject to settlement after days 
after application of tax provision  we recorded a gain on the sale of approximately million in the fourth quarter of general the federal medicare program accounted for approximately  and of hospital patient days in   and  respectively 
the state medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of hospital patient days in  and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
the medicare payment rate increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
both federal and state legislatures are continuing to scrutinize the health care industry for the purpose of reducing health care costs 
while we are unable to predict what  if any  future health reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental health care programs 
the balanced budget act of imposed certain limitations on increases in the inpatient medicare rates paid to acute care hospitals 
payments for medicare outpatient services provided at acute care hospitals and home health services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain limits 
the balanced budget act of requires that the payment for those services be converted to a prospective payment system  which will be phased in over time 
the balanced budget act of also includes a managed care option that could direct medicare patients to managed care organizations 
further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit health care spending could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry and our company 
some of our acute care hospitals  like most acute care hospitals in the united states  have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
we expect increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to respond successfully to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental health care programs  will play a significant role in determining the ability of our hospitals to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
we expect the industry trend in increased outpatient services to continue because of the increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
outpatient revenue of our owned or leased hospitals was approximately  and of gross patient service revenue in  and  respectively 
the billing and collection of accounts receivable by hospitals are complicated by the complexity of the medicare and medicaid regulations  increases in managed care  hospital personnel turnover  the dependence of hospitals on physician documentation of medical records  and the subjective judgment involved 
these factors  or any combination of them  may impact our ability to bill and collect our accounts receivable at the rates we have anticipated  which could negatively affect our future cash flows 
the federal government and a number of states are increasing the resources devoted to investigating allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
at the same time  regulatory and law enforcement authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on providers by the social security act and medicare and medicaid regulations 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with such laws  a determination that we have violated such laws  or even the public announcement that we were being investigated concerning possible violations  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
our historical financial trend has been impacted favorably by our success in acquiring acute care hospitals 
while we believe that trends in the health care industry described above may create possible future acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to maintain our current growth rate through hospital acquisitions and successfully integrate the hospitals into our system 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
resolution of matters  for example  final settlements with third party payors  may result in changes from those estimates 
the timing and amount of such changes in estimates may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of net operating revenue 
such information has been derived from our consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report 
the results of operations for the periods presented include hospitals from their acquisition dates  as previously discussed 
year ended december  net operating revenue operating expenses ebitda depreciation and amortization interest  net minority interest loss on sale income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income operating expenses represent expenses before interest  minority interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization and minority interest 
we understand that industry analysts generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a company that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of a company and its ability to service debt 
we believe that an increase in ebitda level is an indicator of our improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
given that ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
hospital revenues are received primarily from medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance 
the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program is expected to increase due to the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
in addition  states  insurance companies and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals as opposed to their standard rates 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may affect the hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net operating revenue growth 
net operating revenue is comprised of net patient service revenue from our owned and leased hospitals  management and professional services revenue  and other revenue 
net patient service revenue is reported net of contractual adjustments and policy discounts 
the adjustments principally result from differences between the hospitals customary charges and payment rates under the medicare  medicaid and other third party payor programs 
customary charges generally have increased at a faster rate than the rate of increase for medicare and medicaid payments 
operating expenses of the hospitals primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits  purchased services  supplies  provision for doubtful accounts  rentals and leases  and other operating expenses  principally consisting of utilities  insurance  property taxes  travel  freight  postage  telephone  advertising  repairs and maintenance 
management and professional services revenue is comprised of fees from management and professional consulting services provided to third party hospitals pursuant to management contracts and consulting arrangements 
management and professional services revenue plus reimbursable expenses total less than of consolidated net operating revenue 
operating expenses for the management and professional services business primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits and reimbursable expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports resulted in a positive revenue adjustment of million  or of net operating revenue  in  and a negative revenue adjustment of million  or of net operating revenue in net patient service revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods increased million  or  resulting from market expansion  inpatient volume increases  new services and price increases 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of additional hospitals in and operating expenses increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue  in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted primarily from new services  volume increases  change in case mix  increased physician recruiting and increased provision for doubtful accounts 
the consolidated provision for doubtful accounts increased to of net operating revenue in from of net operating revenue in  primarily related to two hospitals acquired in the majority of the increase in operating expenses was attributable to the acquisition of additional hospitals in and ebitda increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue  in depreciation and amortization expense increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the acquisition of additional hospitals in and  and capital expenditures at hospitals owned during both periods 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
this was a result of increased borrowings to finance the acquisition of additional hospitals in and and higher interest rates  offset by the reduction in the revolving credit facility with the net proceeds of the common stock offering and the sale of convertible subordinated notes 
loss on sale of assets totaled million in  primarily as a result of a net loss of million on the sale of two hospitals and an office building 
we sold ojai valley community hospital in october at a loss of approximately million 
we sold general hospital in december for a gain of approximately million 
we sold an office building in december for a gain of approximately million 
the company does not expect future earnings to be impacted as a result of these sales 
income before provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million in  an increase of million or 
on a pro forma basis  adjusting actual net income to exclude the after tax effect of the sales of the two hospitals and the office building  net income for the year was million 
our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million in these provisions reflect effective income tax rates of for  compared to for see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates 
net income was million  or of net operating revenue  in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
net patient service revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods  including palestine regional medical center  increased million  or  resulting from inpatient and outpatient volume increases  new services and price increases 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports resulted in positive revenue adjustments of million  or of net operating revenue  in  and million  or of net revenues in the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of additional hospitals in and operating expenses increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted primarily from new services  volume increases  change in case mix and increased recruiting expenses  offset by a decrease in provision for doubtful accounts

the increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of additional hospitals in and our provision for income taxes was million in  compared to million in these provisions reflect effective income tax rates of in compared to in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates 
net income was million  or of net operating revenue  in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in liquidity and capital resources capital resources in april  we completed our public offering of  shares of common stock 
net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to reduce the balance of our revolving credit line 
in november and december   we sold million of convertible subordinated notes  due november  net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit 
the notes bear interest from november  at the rate of per year  payable semi annually on may and november  beginning on may  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes on or after november   at the then current redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
note holders may require us to repurchase all of the holder s notes at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in some circumstances involving a change of control 
the notes are unsecured obligations and rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the indenture does not contain any financial covenants 
total long term obligations  less current maturities  decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the reduction in the revolving credit facility with the net proceeds from the common stock offering  the sale of convertible subordinated notes and the proceeds from the sale of ojai valley community hospital and general hospital  offset by borrowings to finance the city of ennis hospital and bolivar medical center acquisitions 
in september  we increased the size of our credit facility to million  including a million revolving credit facility and a million end loaded lease facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million available  which includes availability under the end loaded lease facility that can be converted to revolver availability at our option 
our credit facility contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness including contingent obligations  sell material assets  retire  redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock  acquire the capital stock or assets of another business  and pay dividends 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain a specified net worth and meet or exceed certain coverage  leverage  and indebtedness ratios 
indebtedness under our credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we are required under our credit facility to pay certain commitment fees  based upon amounts borrowed and available for borrowing  during the term of our agreement 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage our interest rate exposure under our credit facility 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  that effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
in june  the counterparty exercised its option to terminate the swap agreement 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we secured a fixed interest rate on the swap agreement 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   resulting primarily from increased business volumes and effective management of our working capital 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  our cash flows from operating activities increased by million from million in to million in offsetting our improved profitability were increases in accounts receivable and other assets 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher volumes at same hospitals and acquisition hospitals  as well as temporary delays in billing of medicare and medicaid accounts receivable while waiting for assignment of applicable third party provider numbers at those newly acquired hospitals 
the increase in other assets relates to income tax benefits resulting from employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
the use of our cash in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  resulting primarily from smaller outlays of cash for acquisitions and disposal of hospitals in  compared to our cash flows provided by financing activities decreased from million in to million in  resulting from reduced borrowings for acquisitions in  and the net effect of proceeds from a common stock offering and the sale of convertible debt used to pay down existing debt under our revolving credit agreement 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   resulting primarily from increased business volumes and effective management of our working capital 
our cash flows from operating activities increased by million from million used in to million provided in offsetting our improved profitability was a large increase in accounts receivable  both at same hospitals and newly acquired hospitals 
this increase was due to higher volumes at same hospitals and acquisition hospitals  as well as temporary delays in billing of medicare and medicaid accounts receivable while waiting for assignment of applicable third party provider numbers at those newly acquired hospitals 
the use of our cash in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  reflecting some smaller  less expensive acquisitions during our cash flows provided by financing activities decreased million from million in to million in  due primarily to decreased borrowings related to acquisitions 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  in  and  were million  million  and million  respectively  inclusive of construction projects 
capital expenditures for our owned hospitals may vary from year to year depending on facility improvements and service enhancements undertaken by the hospitals 
we expect to make total capital expenditures in of approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses or construction projects 
planned capital expenditures for consist principally of capital improvements to owned and leased hospitals 
we expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
with respect to construction projects  we have started construction of a replacement facility for elko general hospital  currently expected to cost approximately million  and if pre determined operating levels are achieved  we have agreed to build replacement facilities for eunice community medical center  currently expected to cost approximately million  and glades general hospital  currently expected to cost approximately million 
we cannot estimate whether and when each hospital will achieve its individual pre determined operating levels  but we believe it will take approximately thirty six months to complete construction from such date 
we have started construction on an ancillary expansion at havasu regional medical center  which is expected to cost approximately million 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions we have made  we have committed and may commit in the future to spend specified amounts for capital expenditures 
impact of recently issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value  which results in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of both the hedge and the hedged item being recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income in the same period 
changes in fair value of derivatives not meeting the statement s hedge criteria are recognized in income 
we adopted the statement on january   and this adoption did not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
our only derivative is an interest rate swap agreement 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we are required to recognize gains losses on the swap in other comprehensive income and to provide additional footnote disclosures  in our quarterly reports on form q  related to hedging strategies beginning with the first quarter of form q 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase  especially during periods of inflation and labor shortages 
in addition  suppliers pass along to us rising costs in the form of higher prices 
we generally have been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges for services  expanding services  and implementing cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
in light of cost containment measures imposed by government agencies and private insurance companies  we are unable to predict our ability to offset or control future cost increases  or our ability to pass on the increased costs associated with providing health care services to patients with government or managed care payors  unless such payors correspondingly increase reimbursement rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
our primary market risk involves interest rate risk 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of u 
s 
interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in u 
s 
interest rates  we generally expect to maintain a substantial percent of our debt as fixed rate in nature by entering into interest rate swap transactions 
our only derivatives relate to interest rate swap agreements 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
in june  the counterparty exercised its option to terminate the swap agreement 
the million interest rate swap agreement  entered into in  is a contract to exchange periodically fixed and floating interest rate payments over the life of the agreement 
the floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the swap agreement was consummated 
the interest rate swap agreement does not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposure 
the swap agreement allows the counterparty a one time option at the end of the initial term to cancel the agreement or extend the swap for an incremental time period 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to our financial instrument 
the counterparty is a creditworthy financial institution  and we expect our counterparty to fully satisfy its contract obligation 
we received a weighted average rate of  and  and paid a weighted average rate of  and on our interest rate swap agreements  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the carrying amount of our total long term debt  less current maturities  of million and million at december  and  respectively  approximated fair value 
we had million and million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively  with interest rate swaps in place to offset the variability of million of this balance in and million in at the december  borrowing level  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  considering the effect of the interest rate hedge agreement  would have no impact on our net income and cash flows 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on the fixed rate debt would not have a material impact on the fair value of such debt
