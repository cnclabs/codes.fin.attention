the company also distributes licenses as packaged software products that are resold by systems integrators and other value added resellers

the company restructured in the fourth quarter of fiscal  reducing its total full time employee base by percent

liquidity and capital resources october  october  change cash and short term investments millions percentage of total assets cash and short term investments decreased to million at october  from million at october   and  million at october  the fiscal decrease can be attributed to million used to repurchase common stock  million invested in long term and venture capital funds  million used for other long term investing activities  million of cash used for expenditures on property  plant and equipment  and million cash used to increase the cash reserved as collateral for building leases 
these expenditures were partially offset by million provided by operating activities  million provided by issuances of common stock  and million provided from the sale of buildings on the company s orem  utah campus 
during the year  the company continued to consolidate its utah operations to its provo facility making the properties currently owned and occupied in orem  utah unnecessary 
in may and october  the company finalized the sale of a portion of these buildings 
the remaining buildings are expected to be sold during the first half of fiscal the company s investment portfolio is diversified among security types  industry groups  and individual issuers 
to achieve potentially higher returns  a portion of the company s investment portfolio is invested in equity securities and mutual funds  which incur market risk 
the company s combined short and long term investment portfolio includes securities with net unrealized losses of million  before effects of deferred taxes  as of october  the majority of the company s unrealized losses are due to the company s investment in marchfirst  which is carried at fair market value

the company s principal source of liquidity continues to be from operations 
at october   the company s principal unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash and short term investments and available borrowing capacity of approximately million under its credit facilities 
the company s liquidity needs are principally for financing of accounts receivable  capital assets  strategic investments  product development  and flexibility in a dynamic and competitive operating environment 
novell annual report the company anticipates being able to fund its current operations and capital expenditures planned for the foreseeable future with existing cash and short term investments together with internally generated funds 
the company believes that borrowings under the company s credit facilities or public offerings of equity or debt securities are available if the need arises 
investments will continue in product development and in new and existing areas of technology 
cash may also be used to acquire technology through purchases and strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures in fiscal are anticipated to be approximately million  but could be reduced if the growth of the company is less than presently anticipated 
the company also intends to commit an additional million during fiscal to venture capital funds 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors authorized the use of up to million for the repurchase of additional outstanding shares of the company s common stock through october  as of october   million had been spent to repurchase million shares under this plan

euro conversion on january   of the members of the european union established fixed conversion rates among their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
at the end of a three year transition period during which companies may choose to operate either in the euro or national currencies  the legacy currencies will be eliminated 
in june  the company formed a cross functional team to assess the impact of the conversion on the company s operations and to address associated issues 
the company is currently conducting transactions in the euro and expects to have all affected information systems fully converted by april novell does not expect the euro conversion to have a material effect on its competitive position or financial results 
risk factors affecting future results of operations the company s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results are the following business conditions and the general economy  competitive factors  such as rival operating systems  directories and applications  acceptance of new products and price pressures  availability of third party compatible products at below market prices  risk of nonpayment of accounts or notes receivable  risks associated with foreign operations  risk of product line or inventory obsolescence due to shifts in technologies or market demand  timing of software product introductions  market fluctuations of investment securities  and litigation 
our financial results may vary the company often experiences a higher volume of sales at the end of the quarter and during the fourth quarter 
because of this  fixed costs that are out of line with sales levels may not be detected until late in any given quarter 
as a result  results of operations could be adversely affected  and even produce a loss 
operating results have been and may also be affected by other factors including  but not limited to timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers product mix  a shift from higher margin products  such as licensing  to lower margin products or services  such as boxed products delays or problems with our fulfillment agents impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the price of our products in international locations novell annual report our inability to respond to the decline in sales through the distribution channel our inability to derive benefits from the restructuring and new corporate strategy we face intense competition for attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the computer industry the ability of the company to maintain its competitive technological position will depend  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there is a risk of departure due to the competitive environment in the software industry 
the loss of a significant group of key personnel would adversely affect the company s performance 
over the past year  the company has lost several of its vice presidents 
the failure to successfully promote and hire suitable replacements in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
we have experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to various factors as is common in the computer software industry  novell has experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to the complexity of software products  the need for extensive testing of software to ensure compatibility of new releases with a wide variety of application software and hardware devices  and the need to debug products prior to extensive distribution 
significant delays in developing  completing or shipping new or enhanced products would adversely affect the company 
moreover  the company may experience delays in market acceptance of new releases of its products as the company engages in marketing and education of the user base regarding the advantages and system requirements for the new products and as customers evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of upgrading 
the company has encountered these issues on each major new release of its products  and expects that it will encounter such issues in the future 
novell s ability to achieve desired levels of sales growth depends at least in part on the successful completion  introduction and sale of new versions of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others  or that the company s research and development efforts will be successful 
should novell experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to new product releases  the company s sales and net income could be adversely affected 
we may not be successful at introducing new technologies another goal of the company is to achieve widespread acceptance and adoption of novell s net services and e solutions products  directory services nds  and the products and applications that take advantage of directory services 
the company s ability to achieve success with its net services and nds solutions is dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to the following development of key net services and directory products and upgrades  the acceptance of those products by large industry partners  the marketing of those products through appropriate channels of distribution  and the acceptance of those products in major accounts 
the company has only had limited success in introducing new technologies and there can be no assurance of success with net services or nds solutions 
our existing product sales may deteriorate more rapidly than sales of our new products increase the company has several existing products  which it has been selling and upgrading for many years 
technology shifts or competition could occur causing sales of these products to decline at a faster rate than the company is able to increase sales of new products or technologies 
we face risks from our international operations the company has sales offices in countries worldwide 
it also has significant operations in ireland and japan  and conducts product development in india 
international operations are subject to inherent risks novell annual report including  but not limited to fluctuating currency exchange rates  longer payment cycles  difficulties in managing multiple offshore operations  increased tariffs and duties  price controls  restrictions on foreign currencies  trade barriers  and political unrest 
these factors could have a material impact on our financial condition in the future 
our long term and venture capital fund investments could become impaired included in the company s investment portfolio are investments made for strategic business purposes  such as marchfirst  and investments through the novell venture fund 
novell venture fund investments are in private companies  generally small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  and funds managed by venture capitalists 
the value of these investments is dependent on the performance  successful acquisition  and or initial public offering of the investees 
some or all of these investments could become permanently impaired in the future requiring the company to record investment losses 
our stock price will fluctuate the company s future earnings and stock price could be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth  any such shortfall in earnings can be expected to have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of novell s common stock in any given period 
revenue fluctuations may also contribute to the volatility of the trading price of novell common stock in any given period 
in addition  the market prices for securities of software companies have been historically volatile 
the market price of novell common stock  in particular  has been subject to wide fluctuations in the past 
as a result of the foregoing factors and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of novell s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations within a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general 
novell believes that it has the product offerings  facilities  personnel  and competitive and financial resources for continued business success  but future revenues  costs  margins  product mix  and profits are all influenced by a number of factors  such as those discussed above 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
to mitigate some of these risks  the company utilizes currency forward contracts and currency options 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease approximately in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
novell annual report market risk the company also holds available for sale equity securities in its short term investment portfolio 
a adverse change in prices of these short term equity securities would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s short term investments 
in addition  the company invests in long term equity securities  included in its portfolio of investments  for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  both public and private 
because of the nature of these investments  the company is exposed to equity price risks 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
as of october  unrealized losses on long term public equity securities totaled million  the majority of which pertains to the company s investment in marchfirst 
a adverse change in equity prices of long term equity securities would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk the company hedges currency risks of investments denominated in foreign currencies with currency forward contracts 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to the company 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and certain other asian and european currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  the company has established balance sheet hedging programs 
currency forward contracts and currency options are utilized in these hedging programs 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if the company did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an adverse change of in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
