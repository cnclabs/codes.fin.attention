currently the technology is used to provide noncontact measurement applications requiring a three dimensional perspective 
the measurement of shape complements the traditional x rite technologies of color and light measurement 
the ability to provide high resolution  non contact  spatial measurement will elevate x rite s exposure to many dynamic markets  such as electronic components  micromachines  telecommunications and biomedicine 
coherix is located in ann arbor  michigan  but will also be conducting research  development and manufacturing at the x rite headquarters in grandville  michigan
