item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data item and our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this form k 
general we are a medical technology company specializing in instruments and implants for arthroscopic sports medicine  and powered surgical instruments  for orthopaedic  ent  neurosurgery and other surgical specialties 
we are also a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of advanced medical devices  including rf electrosurgery systems used in all types of surgery  ecg electrodes for heart monitoring  and minimally invasive surgical devices 
our products are used in a variety of clinical settings  such as operating rooms  surgery centers  physicians offices and critical care areas of hospitals 
results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain categories included in our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated years ended december net sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expense research and development expense income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes and extraordinary item provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item compared to sales for were  an increase of compared to sales of  in sales in our orthopaedic businesses grew to  in from  in adjusted for constant foreign currency exchange rates  orthopaedic sales growth would have been 
arthroscopy sales  which represent approximately of orthopaedic revenues  were essentially flat at  in  as compared to  in powered surgical instrument sales  which represent approximately of orthopaedic revenues  grew in to  as compared to  in the increase in powered surgical instrument sales of consists of internal growth and growth due to our acquisition of the powered instrument business from m in august the powered instrument acquisition note 
patient care  electrosurgery and minimally invasive surgical sales declined to  from  in this decline primarily occurred in the surgical suction product line as a result of increased competition and pricing pressure 
cost of sales increased to  in compared to  in gross margin percentage for was 
in connection with the august powered instrument acquisition  we increased the acquired value of inventory by  this inventory was sold during the quarter ended september and served to increase cost of sales in by  excluding the impact of this non recurring adjustment  cost of sales was  in excluding the nonrecurring adjustment  our gross margin percentage for was 
the decline in gross margin percentage in as compared to is primarily a result of the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed above 
selling and administrative costs increased to  in as compared to  in during the second quarter of  we announced we would replace our arthroscopy direct sales force with non stocking exclusive sales agent groups in certain geographic regions of the united states 
as a result  we recorded a nonrecurring severance charge of  in the second quarter of which is included in selling and administrative expense 
also included in selling and administrative expense is the  benefit  recorded in the fourth quarter of  of a previously recorded litigation accrual which was settled on favorable terms 
excluding these non recurring items  as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expense increased to in as compared to in this increase  as a percentage of sales  is a result of increased spending on sales and marketing programs  including higher commission and other costs associated with the change to exclusive sales agent groups 
research and development expense was  in as compared to  in as a percentage of sales  research and development expense increased to in as compared to in this increase represents expanded research and development efforts primarily focused in the orthopaedic product lines 
interest expense for was  compared to  in the increase is primarily due to an increase in the overall weighted average interest rate on our borrowings from in to in see discussion under liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
compared to sales for were  an increase of compared to sales of  in sales in our orthopaedic businesses grew to  from  in arthroscopy sales  which represent approximately of orthopaedic revenues  grew to  in  as compared to  in approximately of the total increase in arthroscopy sales is internal growth and is due to our acquisition of an arthroscopy product line from m in november the arthroscopy acquisition note 
powered surgical instrument sales  which represent approximately of orthopaedic revenues  grew to  in as compared to  in approximately of the total increase in powered surgical instrument sales is internal growth and is due to our acquisition of the powered instrument business from m in august the powered instrument acquisition note 
patient care  electrosurgery and minimally invasive surgical sales declined to  in from  in approximately of the total orthopaedic sales growth in as compared to reflects the pricing impact of changes in distribution from as compared to the first six months of in connection with the december acquisition of linvatec corporation the linvatec acquisition from bristol myers squibb bms  we entered into fixed price distribution agreements with zimmer  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of bms  to distribute certain of our products in selected geographic markets 
beginning in the third quarter of  most of the products formerly distributed by zimmer were sold and distributed directly by us  resulting in improved pricing for the affected products 
cost of sales increased to  in compared to  in in connection with the august powered instrument acquisition  we increased the acquired value of inventory by  this inventory was sold during the quarter ended september and served to increase cost of sales in by  similarly  in connection with purchase accounting for the linvatec acquisition  we increased the acquired value of inventory by  over our production cost  this inventory was sold during the quarter ended march and served to increase cost of sales in by  excluding the impact of these non recurring adjustments  cost of sales increased to  in from  in  as a result of increased sales volumes as described above 
excluding the nonrecurring adjustments  our gross margin percentage for was compared to for the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in our orthopaedic product lines which carry higher gross margins than certain of our other product lines as well as improved pricing resulting from the elimination of most of the fixed price product distribution agreements with zimmer discussed previously 
selling and administrative costs increased to  in as compared to  in the increase in selling and administrative expense is primarily a result of additional selling expense associated with the increase in sales in as compared to  including increased costs associated with the direct selling and distribution of products formerly distributed through zimmer during the first half of partially offsetting these increases  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized the benefit amounting to  of a previously recorded litigation accrual which was settled on favorable terms and is included in selling and administrative expense 
excluding this nonrecurring benefit  as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expense increased to in as compared to in research and development expense was  in as compared to  in as a percentage of sales  research and development expense was in as compared to in the amount of research and development expense incurred in is consistent with representing our ongoing efforts in this area  the decrease in expense as a percentage of sales is primarily a result of higher sales in as compared to interest expense for was  compared to  in in connection with the powered instrument acquisition  our existing credit facility was amended in the third quarter of to provide for an additional  loan commitment which was used to fund the acquisition purchase price 
the increase in interest expense is a result of these higher term loan borrowings and higher average borrowings under our revolving credit facility during as compared to we funded our arthroscopy acquisition during the fourth quarter of through borrowings under the revolving credit facility which resulted in the higher average borrowings 
see discussion under liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during the first quarter of  we completed an offering of subordinated notes the notes and used the net proceeds to repay a portion of our term loans under our credit facility 
deferred financing fees relating to the portion of the credit facility repaid amounting to   net of income taxes were written off as an extraordinary charge 
see note and discussion under liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our net working capital position increased  or to  at december compared to  at december net cash provided by operations was  in compared to  in operating cash flow in decreased primarily as a result of lower net income in as compared to operating cash flow in was positively impacted primarily by depreciation  amortization and deferred income taxes 
operating cash flow in was negatively impacted primarily as a result of increased inventories 
the increase in inventories is a result of overall higher quantities on hand in support of higher sales volumes in as compared to net cash provided by operations was  in compared to  in operating cash flow in increased primarily as a result of higher net income in as compared to operating cash flow in was positively impacted primarily by depreciation  amortization and deferred income taxes 
operating cash flow in was negatively impacted primarily as a result of increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily related to the increase in sales  the increase in inventory is related to the arthroscopy acquisition and powered instrument acquisition and overall higher quantities on hand 
adversely impacting operating cash flows in was an increase in accounts receivable and inventories primarily as a result of the timing of our assumption of linvatec s international operations previously managed by zimmer 
in connection with the linvatec acquisition  we assumed responsibility for the majority of linvatec s international operations on july  accordingly  the receivables and inventory of the international operations were not acquired or funded by the company until the second half of net cash used by investing activities in included  paid related to the imagyn acquisition 
net cash used by investing activities in included  paid related to the powered instrument acquisition 
net cash used by investing activities in included  related to the arthroscopy acquisition and  of payments related to the linvatec acquisition and the acquisition of a surgical suction instrument and tubing product line from davol  inc capital expenditures for  and amounted to   and  respectively 
financing activities in consisted primarily of  in borrowings under the revolving credit facility and  in scheduled payments on our term loans 
financing activities during consisted primarily of a  term loan used to fund the powered instrument acquisition  scheduled payments of  on our previously existing term loans and  in repayments on our revolving credit facility 
financing activities during involved the completion of the notes offering in the aggregate principal amount of  net proceeds from the offering amounting to  were used to repay a portion of our term loans under our credit facility 
additionally  we borrowed  under the revolving credit facility primarily to finance the arthroscopy acquisition and made scheduled payments of  on our term loans 
management believes that cash generated from operations  our current cash resources and funds available under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to ensure continued working capital for operations  debt service and funding of capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
foreign operations our foreign operations are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including governmental instability  war and other international conflicts  civil and labor disturbances  requirements of local ownership  partial or total expropriation  nationalization  currency devaluation  foreign exchange controls and foreign laws and policies  each of which may limit the movement of assets or funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks involve foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manufacture our products in the united states and distribute our products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as of december  we have not entered into any forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate our foreign currency exposure by transacting the majority of our foreign sales in united states dollars 
during  changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our sales and income before income taxes by approximately  we will continue to monitor and evaluate our foreign currency exposure and the need to enter into a forward foreign currency exchange contract or other hedging arrangement 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our borrowings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate swaps  a form of derivative  are used to manage interest rate risk 
currently  we have entered into two interest rate swaps each with a  notional amount expiring in june and june which effectively convert  of the approximate  of floating rate borrowings under our credit facility into fixed rate borrowings with a base interest rate averaging 
provisions in one of the interest rate swaps cancels such agreement when libor exceeds 
if market interest rates for similar borrowings average more in than they did in  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swaps  would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by  comparatively  if market interest rates averaged less in than they did during  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swaps  would decrease  and income before income taxes would increase by  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements and does not consider any actions by management to mitigate our exposure to such a change
