the company has grown both internally and through acquisitions  increasing both the variety of its treatment programs and services and the number of its management contracts  which totaled as of august  at that date the company had contracts to provide eap and managed behavioral health services covering approximately million lives 
over the last nine years  the company has increased its management contracts from to a total of as of august  and currently has contract locations in states and the district of columbia 
of its management contracts  relate to mental health treatment programs and relate to physical rehabilitation programs 
the company has also developed a proprietary mental health outcomes measurement system known as cqi 
at august   the company had contracts to provide outcome measurement services at contract locations as well as database project contracts

the company believes it is strategically sized to deliver national programs  while providing local  individualized service to both employers and health plans and to their respective employees or members 
the company s strategic plan contemplates continued growth in this area of its business 
in addition  the company plans to enhance its position as the leader in the contract management of mental health programs and to further expand the range of services which it offers to its client hospitals to include other clinical and related services and programs 
a significant challenge in marketing clinical management contracts is overcoming the initial reservations that many hospital administrators have with outsourcing key clinical services 
the company believes its expertise in working with hospital administrators  its reputation in the industry and its existing hospital contractual relationships provide it with a significant advantage in marketing new contracts 
the company also believes it has opportunities to cross sell management services of mental health and physical rehabilitation programs to client hospitals by marketing its mental health services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only physical rehabilitation programs  and by marketing its physical rehabilitation services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only mental health programs 
the company has successfully expanded the breadth of services it offers to include the full continuum of mental health services  including outcome measurement services  and physical rehabilitation services 
its management contracts increasingly cover multiple services 
revenues managed behavioral health care services and employee assistance programs through its subsidiary horizon behavioral services  inc hbs  the company offers an array of managed care products to corporate clients  self funded employer groups  commercial hmo and ppo plans  government agencies  and third party payors 
revenues are derived from employee assistance program eap services  administrative services only contracts  and at risk managed behavioral health services 
revenues from eap contracts are typically based on a per employee per month capitated rate multiplied by the number of eligible employees 
the rate for eap plans is dependent upon services provided under the contract terms 
each plan is specifically written to fulfill the clients needs and can offer different numbers of counseling sessions and other benefits  such as work life services including child care and elder care consultation  referral resources and critical incident debriefing and intervention 
revenues for administrative services only contracts relate to the management of behavioral health benefits and are dependent upon the number of contracts and the services provided 
fees are usually a case rate or a per employee per month fee multiplied by the number of eligible members 
the client is able to benefit from the mental page health professionals employed or independently contracted by the company at favorably discounted rates  as well as the company s expertise in clinical case management 
the primary factors affecting revenues derived from managed care services are the behavioral health benefits provided and the number of members covered 
fees are based on a per employee per month capitated fee 
the capitated rate is dependent upon the benefit designs and anticipated utilization of the customer and is set forth in the contract  usually as a per member per month capitated rate  which is multiplied by the number of eligible members to determine a monthly fee 
during the fiscal year ended august   the company experienced the termination of six significant managed care contracts  one of which occurred in the quarter ended november   three of which terminated during the quarter ending february   and one of which terminated during the quarter ended may  under a multi year transitional phase out arrangement  with a majority of the impact in the first year 
the effects of the sixth termination occurred gradually over the fiscal year ended august  one of the six contract terminations arose from a client insolvency  which resulted in a  charge to bad debt during the three months ended november  in the prior fiscal year ended august  the six significant contracts provided annual revenues of approximately million  or about of the company s total annual revenues 
in the fiscal year ended august  the remaining contract provided revenues of  the full financial impact of the terminations was realized during fiscal year the company has initiated a number of expense reduction measures to mitigate the financial impact of these terminations  which included reductions in staffing and the closing five of the company s nine clinic locations 
the four remaining company owned clinics operated in the state of florida derive income from counseling and therapy services rendered  and from providing services to patients who are employees of customers under various eap or managed care contracts 
mental health services the primary factors affecting revenues in a period are the number of management contracts with treatment programs in operation in the period and the number of services covered by each such management contract 
the company provides its management services under contracts with terms generally ranging from three to five years 
each contract is tailored to address the differing needs of each client hospital and its community and increasingly cover multiple treatment programs and services 
the company and the client hospital determine the programs and services to be offered by the hospital and managed by the company  which may consist of one or more mental health or physical rehabilitation treatment programs offering inpatient  partial hospitalization  outpatient or home health services 
under the contracts  the hospital is the actual provider of the mental health or physical rehabilitation services and utilizes its own facilities including beds for inpatient programs  nursing staff and support services such as billing  dietary and housekeeping in connection with the operations of its programs 
as the company has expanded the breadth of treatment programs it offers to hospitals  it began to move from managing one type of treatment program under a single contract with a hospital to managing multiple treatment programs under such contract 
contracts are frequently renewed or amended prior to or at their stated expiration dates 
some contracts are terminated prior to their stated expiration dates pursuant to agreement of the parties or early termination provisions included in the contracts 
as of august   and  the company had successfully retained  and  respectively  of the management contracts in existence at the beginning of such fiscal years 
the company believes the most frequent reason its client hospitals do not renew their contracts with the company is that the hospitals decide to manage such programs themselves 
in addition  a number of contracts have not renewed or been closed since passage of the balanced budget act due to a decline in profitability  resulting from unfavorable changes in medicare reimbursement 
under each contract  the company receives a fee for its management services from the client hospital 
management fees may be either a variable fee related in part to patient volume  a fixed monthly fee or reimbursement for specified direct program costs plus a fixed fee 
the management fee is frequently subject to periodic adjustments as a result of changes in the consumer price index or other economic factors 
payors  including page medicare and medicaid  are attempting to manage costs  resulting in declining amounts paid or reimbursed to hospitals for the services provided 
as a result  the company anticipates that the number of patients served by general acute care hospitals on an inpatient basis may decrease and  as an alternative  the number of patients served on a per diem  episodic or capitated basis will increase in the future 
however  additional changes in medicare reimbursement may also unfavorably impact these groups and the company s management contract business as well 
over the past four years  the company has increased revenues through acquisitions discussed below and through internal growth by adding services  price escalators and volume increases at existing contract locations 
the increases have primarily been due to the increased range of services offered per contract and the increased demand for geropsychiatric services as general hospitals have sought to enter this market 
an additional factor affecting revenues has been the company s policy of establishing a minimum direct margin threshold for its management contracts 
the company s mix of programs has changed over the last six years reflecting the increased interest in geropsychiatric programs by general hospitals 
geropsychiatric programs as a percentage of the company s total mental health programs have increased from approximately to during that period 
the fees received by the company for its services under management contracts are paid directly by its client hospitals 
the client hospitals receive reimbursement under either the medicare or medicaid programs or payments from insurers  self funded benefit plans or other third party payors for the mental health and physical rehabilitation services provided to patients of the programs managed by the company 
as a result  the availability and amount of such reimbursement impacts the decisions of general acute care hospitals regarding whether to offer mental health and physical rehabilitation services pursuant to management contracts with the company 
amendments to the medicare regulations in as part of the balanced budget act  established maximum reimbursement amounts on a per case basis for both inpatient mental health and physical rehabilitation services 
in some cases  the reimbursement limitations have resulted in decreased amounts reimbursed to the company s client hospitals and have led to the renegotiation of a lower contract management fee structure for the company 
in other cases the reimbursement limitations have resulted in the termination or non renewal of the management contract  or closure of the program 
the balanced budget act of mandated the elimination of cost based reimbursement of mental health partial hospitalization services 
implementation began august  the resulting reimbursement for partial hospitalization services based on the medicare outpatient prospective payment system utilizes a fixed reimbursement amount per patient day 
the base reimbursement rate is a wage adjusted rate of per day  which lowered medicare reimbursement levels to many hospitals for partial hospitalization services 
this change adversely affected the ability of the company to maintain and or obtain management contracts for partial hospitalization services and the amount of fees paid to the company under such contracts 
revenues from partial hospitalization services were million or of total contract management revenues for the year ended august   down approximately million  or from the prior fiscal year 
of the company s management contracts at august   or of the contracts include partial hospitalization services 
of the contracts including partial hospitalization services  program locations had partial hospitalization services in operation  program locations were in operation but the partial hospitalization services were not in operation  and program locations were not yet in operation for any of the services 
the termination of all partial hospitalization contracts  while unlikely and not expected  could reduce operating income by million or more annually 
in april  cms adopted new rules requiring a cms determination that a facility has provider based status before a provider can bill for the services rendered at the facility 
the new rules have been construed by cms to apply to inpatient mental health and rehabilitation units 
the rules contain numerous requirements  some specifically applicable to facilities operated under management contracts that must be satisfied in order to receive a cms determination of provider based status 
the rules are applicable to a provider for new programs at the beginning of its first medicare cost reporting year that commences after january  existing programs at october  are grand fathered  unless they elect early adoption  until october  the particular application of the rules page to inpatient units managed by the company is currently unclear in several respects 
cms has indicated that it intends to issue guidelines under the new rules  which may provide clarification 
at the current time  there is uncertainty with respect to both precisely how the new rules are to be applied to inpatient units managed by the company and uncertainty as to whether the current structure of the management contracts of the company will satisfy the requirements under the new rules 
the company is unable at this time to definitively determine the effect of the new provider based rules on its business operations  but it is possible that the new provider based rules could result in termination or non renewal of management contracts if  under the new rules  it is not possible for a provider to obtain a determination of provider based status of an inpatient unit operated under a management contract 
recent amendments to the medicare statutes also provide for a phase out of cost based reimbursement of physical rehabilitation services over a two year period beginning no earlier than january  depending on a hospital s medicare fiscal year  the phase out period could be from to months 
the phase in of a prospective payment system with reimbursement based on a functional patient classification may lower medicare reimbursement levels to hospitals for physical rehabilitation services 
this could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain and or obtain management contracts for physical rehabilitation services and the amount of fees paid to the company under such contracts 
operating expenses the primary factor affecting operating expenses for the company s contract management business in any period is the number of programs in operation in the period 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits paid to its clinicians  therapists and supporting personnel 
mental health programs managed by the company generally have a psychiatric medical director  a program director who is usually a psychologist or a social worker  a community education coordinator and additional social workers or therapists as needed 
physical rehabilitation programs managed by the company generally have an independent medical director  a program director  and additional clinical staff tailored to meet the needs of the program and the client hospital  which may include physical and occupational therapists  a speech pathologist  a social worker and other appropriate supporting personnel 
medical directors have a contract with the company under which on site administrative services needed to administer the program are provided 
except for the nursing staff  which is typically provided by the hospital  the other program personnel are generally employees of the company 
at august   the company had an average of employees per contract location 
operating expenses for the company s managed behavioral health care services and employee assistance programs are comprised of approximately salaries and benefits and approximately medical claims from providers 
medical claims includes payments to independent health care professionals providing services under the capitated mental health services contracts and employee assistance programs offered by the company
