item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview drugstore 
com is a leading online drugstore a retail store and information site for health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products and information 
we offer a larger selection of products than typical store based retailers at competitive prices  along with a wealth of health related information  buying guides and other tools designed to help consumers make more educated purchasing decisions 
we were incorporated in april and commercially launched our web site on february  from the period from inception through the commercial launch of our site  our primary activities consisted of 
developing our business model  
raising funds and developing strategic alliances  
designing and developing our web site  
recruiting and training employees  
selecting our fulfillment partners and integrating their systems and processes with ours  
negotiating advertising contracts with several of the major web portals  and 
developing the drugstore 
com brand 
since the commercial launch of our site  we have continued these operating activities and have also focused on acquiring and retaining customers  expanding our product offerings  building vendor relationships  promoting our brand name  improving the efficiency of our order fulfillment processes  establishing customer service operations and developing our own distribution capabilities 
all customer orders are processed through our web store and can be either shipped to the customer or  in the case of refills of existing drugstore 
com or rite aid prescriptions  picked up by the customer at any rite aid store in the united states 
if ordered on our web store  orders are either billed to the customer s credit card or  in the case of prescriptions covered by insurance  billed to third parties 
sales of pharmaceutical products covered by third parties are recorded at the net amount to be received 
generally  we collect cash from credit card sales in two to five days from the date the order is shipped 
amounts billed to third parties are  on average  collected in approximately days  however  such timing can vary depending on the payor 
sales billed to third party insurance companies and pbms through our relationship with rite aid currently represent a significant percentage of our pharmacy sales 
we expect that sales billed to these third parties will continue to represent a significant percentage of our pharmacy sales for the forseeable future 
we routinely offer discounts and coupons to customers 
in addition  if a customer is not satisfied with a particular product or the level of customer service we provide  we generally refund all or a portion of the sale 
allowances for refunds and sales price incentives  including discounts and coupons  are netted against the related sales price in net sales 
we may in the future expand or increase the coupons and discounts we offer to our customers 
in january  we began operating our own  square foot distribution center 
in connection with opening our distribution center  we also opened our own pharmacy as part of our agreement with rite aid 
operating our own distribution facility has required us to hire and train a significant number of new employees  increase inventory levels substantially and establish a significant number of direct relationships with nonpharmaceutical product manufacturers 
we are obligated to buy our pharmaceutical products from rite aid unless we are able to obtain better overall terms from other vendors 
in february  we acquired beauty 
com  a web store specializing in prestige beauty products 
we currently operate beauty 
com as a separate web store  and perform all of beauty 
com s fulfillment activities from our own distribution center 
in january  we laid off approximately employees 
as a result of the layoffs  we decided to consolidate certain of our corporate facilities and are attempting to sublease or exit the leases associated with the excess facilities 
in march  we negotiated the cancellation of a lease for new corporate office space in exchange for forfeiting a portion of our lease deposit  thereby reducing our minimum commitments through by approximately million 
accordingly in the first quarter of  we expect to record a charge ranging from approximately million to million associated with the costs of exiting such leases  forfeiting our lease deposit and writing off the related leasehold improvements and equipment 
we have incurred net losses of million from inception to december  we believe that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next four years and possibly longer 
we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  and difficulties encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as e commerce 
in view of our limited operating history and the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
results of operations net sales fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change in thousands net sales   new customers   orders from repeat customers as a percentage of total orders of net sales from pharmaceutical products net sales includes gross revenues from sales of product and related shipping fees  net of discounts and provision for sales returns  third party reimbursement and other allowances 
we generally refund to customers all or a portion of the selling price  including related shipping fees if applicable  in the event a customer is not satisfied with the product purchased or the quality of customer service provided 
sales returns and allowances have not been significant to date 
revenues from sales of product shipped to customers  and related shipping fees  are recognized upon shipment 
prior to opening our own distribution center  we arranged for shipment of product to customers through various contractual relationships with third party fulfillment partners 
revenues from sales of certain pharmaceutical products ordered through our web store for delivery at a rite aid store are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer 
we currently utilize rite aid as a fulfillment partner  and prior to opening our own distribution center  utilized rxamerica llc for pharmaceutical products and walsh distribution  inc for non pharmaceutical products as fulfillment partners 
upon receiving and validating a customer s order for products that will be purchased by us from a fulfillment partner  and subsequently shipped or delivered to the customer by that fulfillment partner  we submit relevant order information and  if applicable  shipping instructions to that fulfillment partner for processing 
we believe we act as a principal in connection with orders shipped or delivered to customers by fulfillment partners on our behalf because  among other things  we establish the retail prices of significantly all of its non pharmaceutical and non insured pharmaceutical products and accept contractual reimbursement amounts from third party payors for insured pharmaceutical products and shipping fees  contractually take title to  and assume risk of loss of  products prior to their shipment  bear credit and collection risk from the customer or  in the case of certain pharmaceutical sales  third party payors  and bear the risk that the product will be returned 
title to products ordered by customers and shipped or delivered by a fulfillment partner passes to us at the fulfillment partners distribution center or  for certain pharmaceutical sales  when the pharmaceuticals are made available for customer retrieval at a rite aid store 
net sales also includes consignment service fees earned under arrangements in which we do not take title to the inventory and cannot establish pricing 
consignment service fees earned have not been significant to date 
our net sales in both the pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical categories have increased each year since we commenced operations in february due to increases in new customers and repeat orders 
additionally  the average net sales per order has increased from approximately in the year ended january  to approximately in the year ended december  such increase is primarily attributable to higher average basket sizes for repeat customers and changes in the mix of products merchandised in our web store  including seasonal and prestige beauty products 
the decrease in pharmaceutical product sales as a percent of total net sales was primarily related to higher net sales of seasonal and prestige beauty products more than offsetting the full year of rite aid in store pickup service for prescription refills in  which commenced service in the third quarter of we currently expect that net sales for fiscal year will range from approximately million to million 
the level of our net sales that we actually achieve will depend on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following 
the number of customers we are able to acquire and retain  
the frequency of our customers purchases  
the quantity and mix of products our customers purchase  
the quantity of the types of products we are able to offer for sale  
the price we charge for our products  
the amount we charge for shipping  
the extent of sales price incentives  including coupons and discounts that we offer  
the extent of reimbursement available from third party payors  
the level of customer returns we experience  and 
the seasonality that we may experience in our business 
cost of sales fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change in thousands cost of sales   percentage of net sales cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products sold to our customers  including allowances for shrinkage and slow moving and expired inventory  as well as outbound and inbound shipping costs 
additionally  expenses related to promotional inventory included in shipments to customers are included in cost of sales 
payments that we receive from vendors in connection with joint merchandising activities  net of related costs  are netted against cost of sales in the period in which the activities take place 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased as a result of fewer sales incentives offered to customers  including promotional inventory  coupons and discounts 
additionally  we experienced a more favorable mix of product sales in fiscal year  associated primarily with seasonal merchandise and prestige beauty products 
we continue to offer promotional merchandise  coupons and discounts as a strategy to attract new customers  although such amounts have decreased over time as a percentage of net sales 
promotional coupons can only be used by customers to offset the price of non pharmaceutical products 
additionally  our shipping costs exceeded the amount we charged our customers for shipping in both fiscal year and we expect to continue to subsidize a portion of our shipping costs for the foreseeable future as a strategy to attract and retain customers 
we expect cost of sales to increase in absolute dollars to the extent that our sales volume increases 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is expected to range from to in fiscal year  and will fluctuate based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following 
the cost of our products  including the extent of promotional allowances  payments for joint merchandising activities and purchase volume discounts that we are able to obtain from suppliers  
our pricing strategy relative to the cost of our products  including the extent to which we offer promotional merchandise  coupons or discounts  
the mix of products our customers purchase  
the mix of consignment service fees versus product sales  
the mix of cash payments vs 
insurance reimbursement for our pharmacy products  
our shipping pricing strategy relative to the cost of shipping  and 
the extent to which we are able to control product damage  shrinkage and expiration through inventory management practices 
fulfillment and order processing fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change in thousands fulfillment and order processing   percentage of net sales fulfillment and order processing expenses include expenses related to distribution center equipment and packaging supplies  per unit fulfillment fees charged by third parties  bad debt expense  credit card processing fees  and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in customer service  purchasing  and distribution and fulfillment activities  including pharmacists engaged in prescription verification activities and warehouse personnel 
these expenses also include rent expense and depreciation related to the company s distribution center 
fulfillment and order processing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of the efficiencies gained through higher volumes and in operating our own distribution center in fiscal year we expect that fulfillment and order processing expenses in will decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales due to the elimination of the costs associated with certain duplicative fulfillment activities incurred during the transition to our own distribution center in fiscal year and increased operational efficiencies in fiscal year marketing and sales fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change in thousands marketing and sales     percentage of net sales marketing and sales expenses include advertising and marketing expenses  promotional expenditures  and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and merchandising activities 
advertising expenses include media  agency and production costs associated with our branding campaign as well as costs associated with web portal advertising contracts 
the increases in marketing and sales expenses are primarily attributable to increases in headcount and related expenses as well as increased media  agency and production costs associated with our branding campaign in fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year additionally in fiscal year  we acquired and began promoting beauty 
com  and we incurred additional expenses associated with our portal advertising agreement with amazon 
com 
we expect that marketing and sales expenses will decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year due to significantly reduced spending on branding and promotional activities and reductions in headcount and related expenses 
technology and content fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change in thousands technology and content 
   percentage of net sales technology and content expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in maintaining and making minor upgrades and enhancements to our web site and content 
these expenses also include payroll and related expenses for information technology personnel  internet access and hosting charges and web site content and design expenses 
technology and content expenses increased in each of the past two years  primarily due to increased expenses associated with the depreciation of web servers and other equipment and the addition of information technology personnel and additional use of consultants and contract labor 
such personnel assisted in maintaining and making minor upgrades and enhancements to our web store as well as maintaining the systems supporting the web site 
we expect that technology and content expenses will decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year due to reduced headcount and related expenses 
general and administrative fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change in thousands general and administrative    percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  corporate facility expenses  professional services expenses  travel and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in each of the past two years  primarily due to increased expenses associated with the addition of general and administrative personnel  additional professional fees and the cost of corporate facilities  including those associated with beauty 
com  which we acquired in february we expect general and administrative expenses will decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year due to reduced headcount and related expenses 
charitable contribution in the third quarter of fiscal  we donated  shares of our common stock to a foundation established by us and recognized an expense of  in that quarter based on the fair value of the donated common stock 
amortization of intangible assets fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change in thousands amortization of intangible assets    amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense associated with the assets received in connection with agreements with rite aid and with gnc  including access to insurance coverage and a vendor agreement  assets acquired in connection with the purchase of beauty 
com  including goodwill and domain names  and other intangibles  including a technology license agreement  domain names and trademarks 
amortization of intangible assets increased in each of the last two years due to the amortization of intangible assets received in connection with the rite aid and the gnc transactions completed in july and the amortization of the goodwill  domain names and other intangible assets acquired in the beauty 
com acquisition in february we expect that amortization of intangible assets will increase in fiscal year due to a full year of amortization expense being recorded in connection with the beauty 
com acquisition 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events could include  but are not limited to  our inability to achieve our planned penetration rate with respect to insured prescriptions  our inability to achieve the planned growth rates for our rite aid local pickup  gnc branded product or prestige beauty businesses  a decision by rite aid to substantially curtail its marketing spending with respect to us for an extended period of time  or the loss of key prestige beauty vendors 
impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the intangible assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets and their ultimate disposition 
in circumstances where impairment is determined to exist  we will write down the asset to its fair value based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows 
to date  no such impairment has been indicated 
amortization of stock based compensation fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change in thousands amortization of stock based compensation     percentage of net sales we record deferred stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted and restricted stock issued to our employees 
the deferred stock based compensation amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants 
in the case of restricted stock  the deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the purchase price of the restricted stock and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of purchase 
such amounts are amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the applicable agreements 
the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all operating expense categories 
deferred stock based compensation as of december  for stock options and restricted stock issued to our employees will be subsequently recognized as expense for each of the next four fiscal years as follows fiscal year amount in thousands interest income and expense fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change in thousands interest income  net    interest income consists of earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest expense consists of interest associated with capital lease obligations 
net interest income has increased for each of the past two years  primarily due to higher average outstanding cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances associated with our equity financings 
we expect net interest income to decrease in fiscal year as our average outstanding balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities reduces over time 
income taxes 
there was no provision or benefit for income taxes for any period since inception due to our operating losses 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  which expire beginning in due to the issuance and sale of series e preferred stock in and our acquisition of beauty 
com  we incurred ownership changes pursuant to applicable regulations in effect under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
therefore  our use of losses incurred through the date of these ownership changes will be limited during the carryforward period 
we estimate that the use of the approximately million of net operating losses incurred prior to the date of the ownership change would be limited to approximately million per year in order to offset future taxable income 
to the extent that any single year loss is not utilized to the full amount of the limitation  such unused loss is carried over to subsequent years until the earlier of its utilization or the expiration of the relevant carryforward period 
our initial public offering and subsequent equity financings in did not cause additional ownership changes that would result in additional limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  consisting primarily of such net operating loss carryforwards  because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carryforward period 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses of million from inception to december  we believe that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
from our inception through december   we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  included common and preferred stock  yielding net cash proceeds of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million of the year ended december   million for the year ended january   and million in the period from april  inception to december  net cash used in operating activities for each of these periods primarily reflects our net losses offset by changes in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  for the year ended january  and the period from april  inception to december   net cash used in investing activities was million  and million  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was primarily related to the sales of marketable securities outstanding as of january  net of capital expenditures primarily attributable to establishing our own distribution center 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended january  was primarily related to the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering in marketable securities with an original maturity greater than days 
additionally  net cash used in investing activities for all periods presented includes leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment and systems  computer equipment and fixtures and furniture 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million and consisted primarily of cash proceeds from our secondary public offering consummated in march yielding net cash proceeds of million and our private placement of common and preferred stock in august yielding net cash proceeds of million 
for the year ended january   net cash provided by financing activities was million and consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement  and million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
during the period from april  inception to december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of cash proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
as of december  we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as of that date  and excluding a lease for our new corporate headquarters that we cancelled in march  our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under capital and operating leases and strategic agreements with amazon 
com and wellpoint  aggregating approximately million through we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations until we begin generating operating cash flow 
we currently expect to begin generating operating cash flow in  although there can be no assurances as to such timing or that we will ever generate operating cash flow 
we may need to raise additional funds if  for example  we pursue business or technology acquisitions or experience operating losses that exceed our current expectations 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
factors that may affect our business an investment in our securities involves certain risks 
in evaluating us and our business  investors should give careful consideration to the factors listed below 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we are an early stage company in a new and rapidly evolving market  which makes it difficult for investors to determine whether we will accomplish our objectives because drugstore 
com was founded in april and we only began selling products in february  we have a limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business strategy 
we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
an investor in our common stock must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies  as well as the risks we face due to our participation in a new and rapidly evolving market 
these challenges include our 
need to increase our brand awareness  
need to attract and retain customers at a reasonable cost  
need to achieve a critical mass of customers  
need to improve our gross margin and fulfillment cost  
dependence on web site and transaction processing performance and reliability  
need to compete effectively  
need to establish ourselves as an important participant in the evolving market for healthcare products and services on the internet  and 
need to establish and develop relationships in the healthcare industry  particularly in the areas of reimbursement and managed care 
consumers of health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products may not accept our solution  which would harm our revenues and prevent us from becoming profitable if we do not attract and retain a high volume of online customers to our store at a reasonable cost  we will not be able to increase our revenues or achieve profitability 
we may not be able to convert a large number of customers from traditional shopping methods to online shopping for health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products 
even if we are successful at attracting online customers  we expect it will take several years to build a critical mass of these customers 
specific factors that could prevent widespread customer acceptance include 
shipping charges  which do not apply to shopping at traditional drugstores  
delivery time associated with internet orders  as compared to the immediate receipt of products at a physical store  
pricing that does not meet customer expectations of finding the lowest price on the internet  
additional steps and delays in ensuring insurance coverage for prescription products  
lack of coverage of customer prescriptions by some insurance carriers  
lack of consumer awareness of our online pharmacy  
customer concerns about the security of online transactions and the privacy of their personal health information  
product damage from shipping or shipments of wrong or expired products from us or other vendors  resulting in a failure to establish customers trust in buying drugstore items online  
delays in responses to customer inquiries or in deliveries to customers  
inability to serve the acute care needs of customers  including emergency prescription drugs and other urgently needed products  and 
difficulties in returning or exchanging orders 
we expect continuing losses for the next several years we incurred net losses of million for the period from inception through december  we have not achieved profitability 
we only began selling products in february and cannot be certain that we will obtain enough customer traffic or a high enough volume of purchases to generate sufficient revenues and achieve profitability 
we believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses for at least the next three years and possibly longer as we 
fulfill more customer orders as the volume of purchases increases  
increase our sales and marketing activities  
provide our customers with promotional benefits  such as selling selected products or offering shipping below our actual costs  
increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations  and 
develop enhanced technologies  features and fulfillment processes to improve our web site 
we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate  which would further increase our losses 
we may not succeed in establishing the drugstore 
com brand  which would adversely affect customer acceptance and our revenues due to the early stage and competitive nature of the online market for drugstore products  if we do not establish our brand quickly  we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers 
promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide consistent  high quality customer experiences 
to promote our brand  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expense in our advertising efforts 
if these brand promotion activities do not yield increased revenues  we will incur additional losses 
even if our efforts are successful  adverse publicity about our strategic partners could damage our brand and negatively affect customer acceptance of our site 
we expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate and our early stage of development limits our ability to predict revenues and expenses precisely historical trends and quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indicator of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
our revenues and operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including 
demand for our products  
our ability to attract visitors to our web store and convert those visitors into customers  
the frequency of repeat purchases by customers  
changes in the growth rate of internet usage  
average order size  
the mix of products sold  
promotional benefits  such as selling selected products or offering shipping below our actual costs  that we may provide our customers  
our ability to enhance our technology to accommodate any future growth in our operations or customers  
our ability to manage inventory levels and ensure sufficient product supply  
changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  
changes in government regulation  
the availability of reimbursement for pharmacy products  and 
costs related to potential acquisitions of technology or businesses 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for any reason could result in substantial additional operating losses 
the volume and timing of orders of health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products on our web store are difficult to predict because the online market for such products is in its early stages 
due to the limited operating history of our web store  we may have difficulty forecasting revenue from regular customers or overall anticipated revenue trends 
a portion of our revenues may also be seasonal in nature  especially with respect to the sale of certain beauty products  which depend to some extent on seasonal product changes and seasonal purchasing patterns 
consumer fads and other changes in consumer trends may cause shifts in purchasing patterns  resulting in significant fluctuations in our operating results from one quarter to the next 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to fully assess the impact of these factors 
if we are unable to obtain insurance reimbursement coverage for our customers  our ability to sell pharmacy products online could decrease  which would harm our revenues to obtain reimbursement on behalf of our customers for the prescription products that they purchase on our web site  we must maintain relationships with insurance companies and pbms  either directly or through our relationship with rite aid 
we currently rely primarily on rite aid s relationships with insurance companies and pbms and the extension of these relationships to cover prescriptions processed by us 
sales billed through rite aid s relationships currently represent a significant percentage of our pharmacy sales 
we have also entered into direct relationships with pbms and insurers  including wellpoint and cigna 
if we are unable to maintain and leverage our direct relationships  and to the extent rite aid is unable to maintain its relationships  or if these relationships do not extend to cover the prescriptions we process  our ability to obtain reimbursement coverage for our customers would be reduced 
this would reduce the number of customers that fill prescriptions through our web site  which would reduce our revenues 
our ability to enter into direct relationships with insurance companies and pbms  or retain our existing relationships for an extended period of time  is uncertain for the following reasons 
many of these companies are in the early stages of evaluating the impact of the internet and online pharmacies on their businesses 
these companies may delay their decisions to contract with online pharmacies or may decide to develop their own internet capabilities that may compete with us 

many insurance companies have existing contracts with chain drugstores and pbms that have announced their intentions to establish online pharmacies 

some insurance companies and pbms will likely contract with only one or a limited number of online pharmacies 
if our online competitors obtain these contracts and we do not  we would be at a competitive disadvantage 
many of our agreements with insurance companies and pbms are short term  may be terminated with less than days prior notice  and are subject to amendment by such insurance companies and pbms 
our contract with pcs is a year agreement that could terminate earlier if our agreement with rite aid is terminated 
our contract with wellpoint is a year agreement that could terminate earlier if we experience a change of control 
in addition  we must process each insurance application individually  which may raise the costs of processing prescription orders and delay our order processing time 
customers may not initially embrace our online insurance coverage procedure 
we depend on a limited number of distribution partners  if they do not perform  we will not be able to effectively ship orders we are obligated to purchase all of our pharmaceutical products from rite aid unless we are able to obtain better overall terms from another vendor 
our business could be significantly disrupted if rite aid was to breach its contract or suffer adverse developments that affect its ability to supply products to us 
if for any reason rite aid is unable or unwilling to supply products to us in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner  we may not be able to secure alternative fulfillment partners on acceptable terms in a timely manner  or at all 
for a discussion of certain potentially adverse developments at rite aid  see our relationship with rite aid involves many risks and may restrict our ability to promote  contract with  or operate traditional retail stores 
we also rely on third party carriers for shipments to and from distribution facilities and to customers 
we are therefore subject to the risks  including employee strikes and inclement weather  associated with our carriers ability to provide product fulfillment and delivery services to meet our distribution and shipping needs 
failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner would harm our reputation  the drugstore 
com brand and our results of operations 
opening and operating our own distribution center will require significant investments in management resources prior to june  we relied primarily on third parties to fulfill our orders 
we began operating our own  square foot distribution center to achieve greater control over the distribution process and to ensure adequate supplies of products to our customers 
as of june  all of our orders delivered by mail are processed from our distribution center 
if we do not successfully operate our distribution center to accommodate peak volumes  or if the distribution center fails to operate properly  it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand 
operating our distribution center requires that we 
effectively manage our product purchasing function and our inventory levels to avoid product shortages or markdowns due to unpopular or expired inventory  and 
control product damage and shrinkage through effective security measures and inventory management practices 
we have limited experience processing customer order fulfillment through our distribution center and managing significant levels of inventory  and issues arising with respect to the operation of our distribution center could divert management attention from other aspects of our business 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain products on favorable terms 
in connection with the opening of our distribution center  we also expanded our pharmacy operations through our arrangement with rite aid 
our pharmacy operations will subject us to additional regulatory requirements and related costs 
we believe that our new distribution center will provide us with sufficient distribution capacity for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need to increase our distribution capacity sooner than anticipated  and any further expansion would require additional financing that may not be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
any errors in the filling or packaging of the prescription drugs we dispense may expose us to liability and negative publicity pharmacy errors relating to prescriptions  dosage and other aspects of the medication dispensing process can produce liability for us that our insurance may not cover 
because we distribute pharmaceutical products directly to the consumer  we are the most visible participant in the medication distribution chain and therefore have more exposure to liability claims 
our pharmacists are required by law to offer counseling  without additional charge  to our customers about medication  dosage  delivery systems  common side effects and other information deemed significant by the pharmacists 
our pharmacists may have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential adverse effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate such effects 
this counseling is in part accomplished through e mail and inserts included with the prescription  which may increase the risk of miscommunication because the customer is not personally present or may not have provided all relevant information 
we also post product information on our web store 
providing information on pharmaceutical and other products creates the potential for claims to be made against us for negligence  personal injury  wrongful death  product liability  malpractice  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on our product or service offerings 
our general liability  product liability and professional liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
pharmacy errors either by drugstore 
com or our competitors may also produce significant adverse publicity either for us or the entire online pharmacy industry 
because of the significant amount of recent press coverage on internet retailing and online pharmacies  we believe that we will be subject to a higher level of media scrutiny than other pharmacy product channels 
the amount of negative publicity that we or the online pharmacy industry receive as a result of pharmacy or prescription processing errors could be disproportionate in relation to the negative publicity received by other pharmacies making similar mistakes 
we have no control over the pharmacy practices of our competitors  and we cannot ensure that our pharmacists or our prescription processing will be able to operate without error 
we believe customer acceptance of our online shopping experience is based in large part on consumer trust  and negative publicity could erode such trust  or prevent it from growing 
this could result in an immediate reduction in the amount of orders we receive and adversely affect our revenue growth 
we face the risk of systems interruptions and capacity constraints on our web site  possibly resulting in adverse publicity  revenue losses and erosion of customer trust the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers and to maintain adequate customer service levels 
any future systems interruption that results in the unavailability of our web site or reduced order fulfillment performance could result in negative publicity and reduce the volume of goods sold and the attractiveness of our web store  which could negatively affect our revenues 
from time to time  we have experienced temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons  including power failures  software bugs and an overwhelming number of visitors trying to reach our web site 
we may not be able to correct any problem in a timely manner 
because we outsource certain aspects of our system and because some of the reasons for a systems interruption may be outside of our control  we also may not be able to exercise sufficient control to remedy the problem quickly or at all 
we opened our site for customers in february and to the extent that customer traffic grows substantially  we will need to expand the capacity of our systems to accommodate a larger number of visitors 
any inability to scale our systems may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer service  impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment  or delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we are not certain that we will be able to project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our web site accurately or in a timely manner to permit us to effectively upgrade and expand our transaction processing systems or to integrate smoothly any newly developed or purchased modules with our existing systems 
we have grown very rapidly  and we need to manage changing and expanding operations we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations  and anticipate that we will continue to expand 
our number of employees has grown from on december  to on december  this growth has placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we will not be able to implement our business strategy in a rapidly evolving market without an effective planning and management process 
we will not be able to increase revenues unless we continue to improve our transaction processing  operational  financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  expand  train and manage our work force and manage multiple relationships with third parties 
many of our senior management have no prior senior management experience at public companies  and none of our executive officers have prior management experience in the healthcare or retail drugstore industry 
expanding the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings is expensive and difficult  and we may receive no benefit from our expansion we intend to expand the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings by promoting new or complementary products or sales formats 
we cannot be certain that these new offerings will generate sufficient revenues for the costs involved 
expansion of our offerings in this manner could require significant additional expenditures and could strain our management  financial and operational resources 
for example  we may need to incur significant marketing expenses  develop relationships with new fulfillment partners or manufacturers  or comply with new regulations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to expand our product and service offerings in a cost effective or timely manner 
furthermore  any new product or service offering or sales format that is not favorably received by consumers could damage the reputation of our brand 
the lack of market acceptance of such efforts or our inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded offerings to offset their cost could harm our business 
finally  our agreement with amazon 
com contains prohibitions that limit our ability to work with other companies in markets for products and services that are competitive with those offered by amazon 
com  although we are able to sell products and services in these markets ourselves 
our relationship with amazon 
com may restrict some of our activities our relationship with amazon 
com may restrict our activities and is subject to change 
we entered into a technology license and advertising agreement in august with amazon 
com 
in addition  in january we entered into a three year agreement with amazon 
com to integrate various shopping features of our web sites and create a persistent drugstore 
com shopping presence on the amazon 
com web site 
amazon 
com is currently our largest stockholder and jeffrey p 
bezos  amazon 
com s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  is a member of our board of directors 
our relationship with amazon 
com has received significant media attention  but the parties obligations to provide support to each other are limited 
pursuant to these agreements  each party has committed to providing the other with advertising on our respective web sites 
the agreement we entered into in january contains provisions restricting the percentage of total revenues we can obtain from the sale on our web site of products or services other than health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmaceutical products 
we may not assign this agreement without amazon 
com s consent 
under the technology license and advertising agreement  we are restricted from promoting on our web site any company that sells products or services competitive with those that amazon 
com offers or is preparing to produce or market 
if we were acquired by a competitor of amazon 
com and amazon 
com did not vote in favor of the transaction  we would lose our rights to advertise on amazon 
com s web site and to use amazon 
com s technology if we are then using any 
in addition  we have agreed not to sell advertising on our web site to any company that sells products or services competitive with those offered by amazon 
com  although the sale of advertising on our web site is not presently  and is not expected to be  part of our business strategy 
in addition  due to amazon 
com s significant ownership of our common stock  it will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
our relationship with rite aid involves many risks and may restrict our ability to promote  contract with  or operate traditional retail stores in june  we entered into a series of agreements with rite aid 
these agreements involve many aspects of our businesses and the operation of our respective web sites  the fulfillment of orders and the extension of rite aid s insurance relationships to cover prescriptions processed by us 
this type of arrangement is complex and requires a great deal of effort to operate successfully 
as a result  there are many risks related to these arrangements  including some that we may not have foreseen 
it is difficult to assess the likelihood of occurrence of these risks  including the lack of success of the overall arrangement to meet the parties objectives 
in the event that we do not realize the intended benefits of these relationships  we will have expended a great deal of time and effort that could have been directed to more beneficial activities 
in addition  customer perceptions and our business may be adversely impacted if these relationships are not successful 
while rite aid has committed to promoting drugstore 
com in its stores and in its advertising  we do not control the choice of ads that will feature us and this form of advertising may not result in additional drugstore 
com customers 
while the rite aid relationship substantially broadens our ability to provide prescription medications to consumers with insurance reimbursement plans  it may not allow all of our potential customers to purchase these medications from drugstore 
com and receive insurance reimbursement  which could adversely affect consumer perceptions and our revenues 
we have agreed not to promote any other traditional chain drugstore or operate one ourselves 
we have also agreed not to contract with another traditional retail store to fill pharmacy product orders we receive unless a rite aid store is not conveniently located 
these restrictions could limit our flexibility and ability to grow our business if our relationship with rite aid does not develop successfully 
rite aid has received significant negative publicity regarding its financial situation following its announcements regarding the restructuring and extension of its banking facilities  including amendments to financial covenants  the planned restatements of its  and financial statements and the resignation of its independent auditors in november rite aid has since engaged new auditors and made significant changes to its senior management team 
our relationship with rite aid is important to us  particularly in our pharmacy fulfillment operations and in our ability to offer insurance reimbursement coverage to our customers 
if rite aid s financial condition were to worsen  it may be unable to continue to fulfill its obligations to us under our agreements  and this would have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  negative publicity regarding rite aid could negatively affect the drugstore 
com brand and our stock price 
our relationship with pcs was established at the same time as  and in connection with  our relationship with rite aid 
rite aid sold pcs to advanced paradigm 
advanced paradigm may not demonstrate the same level of commitment to our relationship with pcs as rite aid 
rite aid currently owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  rite aid is able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we are dependent on our strategic relationships to help promote our web site and expand our product offerings  if we fail to maintain or enhance these relationships  our development could be hindered we believe that our strategic relationships with amazon 
com  rite aid  pcs and gnc as well as portals and third party distributors are critical to attract customers  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products and the drugstore 
com brand and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities 
if we are unable to develop or maintain key relationships  our ability to attract customers would suffer and our business would be adversely affected 
in addition  we are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success or failure of our strategic partners 
our business could be harmed if any of our key strategic partners were to experience financial or operational difficulties or if other corporate developments adversely affect their performance under our agreements 
we face uncertainty related to pharmaceutical costs and pricing  which could affect our revenues and profitability we expect that pharmacy sales will account for a significant percentage of our total sales 
sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations hmos  pbms and other organizations 
because these organizations are traditionally focused on reduced cost to employer groups  whereas we are focused more on direct customer service  we must devote time and resources to develop third party payor confidence in our approach 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
the efforts of third party payors to contain costs will place downward pressures on profitability from sales of prescription drugs 
our revenues from prescription drug sales may also be affected by health care reform initiatives of federal and state governments  including proposals designed to significantly reduce spending on medicare  medicaid and other government programs  changes in programs providing for reimbursement for the cost of prescription drugs by third party payors and regulatory changes related to the approval process for prescription drugs 
such initiatives could lead to the enactment of federal and state regulations that may adversely impact our prescription drug sales 
we cannot be certain that our products or services will be considered cost effective or that adequate third party reimbursement will be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a profit 
competition from both traditional and online retailers may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services we compete in a market that is highly competitive and expect competition to intensify in the future 
we currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
these competitors include various online stores that sell pharmaceutical as well as over the counter drug and health  wellness  beauty and personal care items  mail service pharmacies  and existing bricks and mortar drugstores 
most of these drugstores  which include national  regional and local drugstore chains  discount drugstores  supermarkets  combination food and drugstores  discount general merchandise stores  mass market retailers  independent drugstores and local merchants  have existed for a longer period  have greater financial resources  have established marketing relationships with leading manufacturers and advertisers  and have secured greater presence in distribution channels 
some of these companies may also commence or expand their presence on the internet 
we also compete with hospitals  hmos and mail order prescription drug providers  all of whom are or may begin offering products and services over the internet 
finally  we are aware of numerous other smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete directly with those offered at drugstore 
com 
we believe that there may be a significant advantage in establishing a large customer base before our competitors do so 
if we fail to attract and retain a large customer base and our competitors establish a more prominent market position relative to ours  this could inhibit our ability to grow 
we also believe we may face a significant competitive challenge from our competitors forming alliances with each other 
our direct online competitors may form partnerships with pbms  hmos or chain drugstores 
the combined resources of these partnerships could pose a significant competitive challenge to drugstore 
com 
in addition  certain pbms and hmos could form alliances with our competitors that would prevent them from also entering into relationships with drugstore 
com 
our inability to partner with a major pbm or hmo could be a major competitive disadvantage to us 
we believe the principal factors that will draw end users to an online shopping application include brand availability  selection  personalized services  convenience  price  accessibility  customer services  quality of search tools  quality of content  and reliability and speed of fulfillment for products ordered 
we will have little or no control over how successful our competitors are in addressing these factors 
in addition  with little difficulty  our online competitors can duplicate many of the products  services and content offered on our site 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  fewer search queries served  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other harmful consequences if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we intend to acquire complementary or strategic businesses  technologies  services or products 
the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company may also require significant management resources that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized or may depend on the continued service of acquired personnel who could choose to leave 
we currently do not have any understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any other acquisition and no other material acquisition is currently being pursued 
future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
our systems and operations  and those of our distributors  are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected problems substantially all of our computer and communications hardware is located at our leased facility in bellevue  washington and our systems infrastructure is hosted at an exodus communications facility in tukwila  washington 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  earthquakes and similar events 
in addition  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders 
we do not currently have redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan and do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate for all losses that may occur 
our distribution facility in new jersey also faces these risks 
we depend on the efficient operation of internet connections from customers to our systems 
these connections  in turn  depend on the efficient operation of web browsers  internet service providers and internet backbone service providers  all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages 
any system delays  failures or loss of data  whatever the cause  could reduce customer satisfaction with our applications and services and harm our sales 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
a material security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability to us 
governmental regulation of our business could require significant expenses  and failure to comply with certain regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  entities engaging in the practice of pharmacy are subject to federal and state regulatory and licensing requirements 
regulations in this area often require subjective interpretation  and we cannot be certain that our attempts to comply with these regulations will be deemed sufficient by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
violations of any regulations could result in various civil and criminal penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses or registrations  seizure of our inventory  or monetary fines  which could adversely affect our operations 
we are also subject to laws and regulations regarding homeopathic drugs  and we may face enforcement actions  lawsuits or claims asserting that we have not complied with these laws and regulations 
as we expand our product and service offerings  more of our products and services will likely be subject to regulation by the fda  which regulates drug advertising and promotion 
complying with fda regulations is time consuming  burdensome and expensive  and could delay our introduction of new products or services 
legislation and regulations currently being considered at the federal and state level could affect our business  including legislation or regulations relating to confidentiality of patient records  including electronic access and storage of such records  disclosure requirements for internet pharmacies  as well as the inclusion of prescription drugs as a medicare benefit 
in addition  state legislatures may add or amend legislation related to the regulation of nonresident pharmacies 
compliance with new laws or regulations could increase our expenses 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of mandates the use of standard transactions  standard identifiers  security and other provisions 
regulations have been proposed to implement these requirements  and we are designing our applications to comply with the proposed regulations 
however  until these regulations become final  possible changes in these regulations could cause us to use additional resources and lead to delays as we revise our web site and operations 
we are subject to extensive regulation relating to the confidentiality and release of patient records 
additional legislation governing the distribution of medical records exists or has been proposed at both the state and federal level 
it may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation 
moreover  we may be restricted or prevented from delivering patient records electronically 
this could have an adverse impact on our ability to gain and retain customers 
failure to attract and retain experienced personnel and senior management could hurt our ability to grow our business our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and senior management 
none of our employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
in addition  none of the members of our senior management team have prior experience in the healthcare industry or in drugstore operations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property  and we may be found to infringe proprietary rights of others  which could harm our business we rely or may in the future rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property 
these afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our sales formats or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  such as the technology used to operate our web site  our content and our trademarks 
we have filed applications for us trademark registrations for drugstore 
com and certain other trademarks 
we may be unable to secure these registrations 
it is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt service names similar to ours  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion 
in addition  there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term drugstore 
com or our other trademark applications 
any claims or customer confusion related to our trademarks  or our failure to obtain any trademark registration  could negatively affect our business 
litigation or proceedings before the us patent and trademark office may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and domain name and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or adverse priority proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business and operating results 
finally  we may in the future sell our products internationally  and the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
third parties may also claim infringement by us with respect to past  current or future technologies 
we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
any such claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may not be able to protect our domain names in all countries or against all infringers  which could decrease the value of our brand name and proprietary rights we currently hold the internet domain name drugstore 
com  as well as various other related names 
domain names generally are regulated by internet regulatory bodies 
the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries is subject to change 
regulatory bodies could establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names 
as a result  we may not acquire or maintain the drugstore 
com domain name in all of the countries in which we conduct business 
the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
therefore  we could be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our brand name  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
we may face liability for content on our web site because we post product information and other content on our web site  we face potential liability for negligence  copyright  patent  trademark  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we post 
such claims have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against internet content distributors 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized duplication of content or unauthorized use of other parties proprietary technology 
although we maintain general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our business 
our officers  directors and certain existing stockholders control the majority of our common stock  which could discourage an acquisition of us or make removal of incumbent management more difficult executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
in addition  amazon 
com beneficially owns approximately and rite aid beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock 
therefore  amazon 
com and rite aid will each be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
amazon 
com s and rite aid s substantial equity stakes in drugstore 
com could also make us a much less attractive acquisition candidate to potential acquirors  because either amazon 
com or rite aid alone could have sufficient votes to prevent the tax free treatment of an acquisition 
we may need additional capital in the future to support our growth  and such additional financing may not be available to us our available funds may not be sufficient to meet all of our long term business development requirements  and we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 
take advantage of favorable business opportunities  including acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  
increase brand awareness  
increase our ability to attract visitors to our web store and convert those visitors into customers  
develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure  
enhance and increase our distribution capacity  
develop new product and service offerings  and 
respond to competitive pressures 
we cannot assure you that any additional financing that we may need will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
our net sales would be harmed if we experience significant credit card fraud a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our net sales and results of operations because we do not carry insurance against this risk 
under current credit card practices  we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder s signature 
certain antitakeover provisions and significant equity ownership by amazon 
com and rite aid could preclude an acquisition provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  washington law and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
further  because amazon 
com and rite aid each own a significant percentage of our capital stock  a competitor of amazon 
com or rite aid as well as other potential acquirors could determine not to merge with or acquire us 
in addition  if we were acquired by an amazon 
com competitor and amazon 
com did not vote in favor of the transaction  we would lose our rights to promotional placements on amazon 
com s web site  and to use amazon 
com s technology if we are then using any 
the potential loss of these rights could inhibit offers to acquire us 
we depend on continued use of the internet and growth of the online drugstore market our future revenues and profits  if any  substantially depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of business and communication by our target customers 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet has occurred only recently 
as a result  acceptance and use may not continue to develop at historical rates  and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt  and continue to use  the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
in addition  the internet may not be accepted as a viable long term commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
our success will depend  in large part  upon third parties maintaining the internet infrastructure to provide a reliable network backbone with the speed  data capacity  security and hardware necessary for reliable internet access and services 
further  the online market for drugstore products is in its infancy 
the market is significantly less developed than the online market for books  auctions  music  software and numerous other consumer products 
even if use of the internet and electronic commerce continues to increase  the rate of growth  if any  of the online drugstore market could be significantly less than the online market for other products 
our rate of revenue growth could therefore be significantly less than other online merchants 
if we are required to collect taxes in additional jurisdictions on the products we sell  we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease in accordance with current industry practice  we do not currently collect sales taxes or other taxes with respect to shipments of goods into states other than washington 
our new distribution center  and any future distribution centers  along with other aspects of our evolving business  may result in additional sales and other tax obligations 
one or more states or the federal government may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out of jurisdiction companies that engage in electronic commerce as we do 
moreover  one or more states or the federal government could begin to impose sales taxes on sales of prescription products  which are not generally taxed at this time 
if so  customers who order prescriptions at our web site and pick them up at a rite aid store would be required to pay sales tax 
a successful assertion by one or more states or the federal government that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our products could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales  decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 
recent federal legislation limits the imposition of us state and local taxes on internet related sales 
in  congress passed the internet tax freedom act  which places a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on internet access  unless such tax was already imposed prior to october   and on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce 
there is a possibility that congress may not renew this legislation in if congress chooses not to renew this legislation  us state and local governments would be free to impose new taxes on electronically purchased goods 
the imposition of taxes on goods sold over the internet by us states and local government would create administration burdens for us and decrease our future sales 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our services could become obsolete and our business would be seriously harmed as the internet and online commerce industry evolve  we must license leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
we may not be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our web store  proprietary technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to do so  it could adversely impact our ability to build the drugstore 
com brand and attract and retain customers 
governmental regulation of the internet and data transmission over the internet could affect our business laws and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
for example  the us congress has passed legislation resulting in internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material 
the european union has also enacted its own privacy regulations 
in particular  many government agencies and consumers are focused on the privacy and security of medical and pharmaceutical records 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing privacy  libel and taxation apply to internet stores such as ours 
the rapid growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online and in particular companies that fill prescriptions or maintain medical or pharmaceutical records 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to internet businesses could adversely affect our ability to attract and serve customers 
our stock price is likely to continue to fluctuate  which could result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be extremely volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and these fluctuations could result in substantial losses for investors 
factors that could cause our stock price to fluctuate include 
quarterly variations in operating results  
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  
announcements by us or our competitors concerning new products  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic relationships  
publicity about our company  our products and services  our strategic partners  our competitors  the online pharmacy industry  or e commerce in general  
additions or departures of key personnel  
any future sales of our common stock or other securities  and 
stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly traded companies in general and internet related companies in particular 
the trading prices of internet related companies and e commerce companies in particular have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the offering price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
in addition if our stock price continues to decline  we may not be able to maintain the standards required for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
delisting would eliminate the substantial benefit currently enjoyed by holders of our common stock of being able to easily buy or sell our common stock 
for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  we must  among other things  maintain a minimum bid price of per share 
as of march   our stock price was per share 
subsequent sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings as of march  we have incentive stock purchase rights outstanding to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at per share 
approximately million of these rights will be exercisable on april  and the remainder will vest ratably every six months for one year thereafter 
in addition  beginning on april    shares of our common stock held by existing stockholders will become available for resale under rule of the securities act of  as amended 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by new or existing stockholders could adversely affect prevailing market price for our common stock and could materially impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities
