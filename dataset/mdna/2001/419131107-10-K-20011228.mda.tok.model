we engineer  develop  subcontract for manufacture  market and sell products for the personal computer pc market and the apple r macintosh r market 
we have three primary product lines  which are sold under the wintv r name analog tv receivers  digital tv receivers and personal video recorders 
our analog tv receiver product line allows pc users to watch cable tv on their pc screen in a resizable window 
our wintv digital tv receivers can receive digital tv transmissions over the air in the us or via satellite throughout the rest of the world and display the digital tv show in a window on the user s pc screen 
we also design  and sub contract the manufacture of pc based personal video recording pvr products  which allow pc users to watch and record tv shows with instant replay and program pause functions 
we believe the most compelling reason for using our products is to watch tv shows while performing other tasks on a pc 
for example  stockbrokers may watch a financial tv program in a small window on their pc monitor while viewing stock quotes or accessing customer accounts 
with a single click of the mouse  the tv program window may be enlarged for full screen viewing 
the home user  while surfing the internet  doing school work  composing e mails  or performing any multitude of other pc activities  may simultaneously watch music videos with our wintv r products 
in addition  our wintv r products can also receive certain data that may be transmitted along with the tv signal  called data broadcasting 
in fiscal  we shipped our millionth wintv r product 
we sell our products through computer and electronic retailers  computer products distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems 
computer and electronics retailers sell our products to end users for use with their pcs or apple r macintosh r computers 
distributors typically sell our products to smaller retail chains and retail stores  through catalogs and to value added resellers var 
oems typically bundle our products in their own products for sale to end users 
our strategy since our entry into the pc video market in  management believes that we have become the world leader in bringing tv content to pcs by focusing on four primary strategic fronts o innovating and diversifying our products o introducing new and desirable features in our products o expanding our worldwide sales and distribution channels o forging strategic relationships with key industry players as more people are looking to their pcs for a total entertainment experience  we believe that our products will enhance the capabilities of the multimedia pc to become a one stop complete integrated entertainment system 
we feel our current and future products have the potential to be the most ubiquitous feature in the pc based home entertainment network 
our current product line includes a wide range of analog  digital and pvr products covering multiple price points 
in addition  different versions of our products incorporate the unique requirements of various national and regional tv standards and the various methods of receiving tv transmissions

this work is done in addition to our research and development efforts in designing  planning and building new products 
we believe that strategic relationships with key suppliers  oems  broadcasters  and internet and e commerce solutions providers give us important advantages in developing new technologies and marketing our products 
by jointly working and sharing our engineering expertise with a variety of other companies  we are able to leverage our investment in research and development and minimize time to market 
our global sales and marketing team cultivates a variety of distribution channels comprising retail stores  distributors  resellers  oems  web stores and third party catalogs 
we work closely with our retailers to enhance sales through joint advertising campaigns and promotions 
we believe that rapidly developing and growing our global presence give us an important strategic position and allows us to benefit many times over from investments in product development  and more firmly establishes the wintv r brand name in the global marketplace 
we seek to maintain and improve our profit margins by  among other things  outsourcing our production to contract manufacturers best suited for the type and volume of our needs 
we also leverage worldwide supplier relationships to assist us in receiving competitive prices for the component parts we buy 
we believe this two tiered approach allows us to be the lowest cost highest quality producer in our marketplace 
successfully engineering products to have low production costs  commonality of parts and the use of one platform for multiple models are other important ways that we believe our technology leadership contributes to the bottom line

product distribution the wintv r products sold through the computer retail market are essentially the same as those available to the oem market 
the differences are in the packaging and in the sophistication of the operating software 
our wintv r boards are primarily sold to the retail market and to oems 
dv wizard pro is sold primarily in the retail market  and our video capture boards are primarily sold in the oem market 
our eskape tm labs products are sold primarily through catalogs 
technology hauppauge digital has developed five generations of wintv r products since their initial introduction in the first generation of wintv r products put the tv image on the pc screen using chroma keying  requiring a dedicated feature connector cable between the wintv r and the vga video board 
despite issues with screen resolution  for the first time  a pc user could watch tv in a resizable window on their pc 
our initial customers were mostly professional pc users  such as financial market professionals who needed to be able to see stock market related tv shows while spending many hours on their pcs  who found having tv in a window on their desktop useful and entertaining 
video clip capture and teletext capabilities  valued features in today s models  can also trace their origins to our first wintv r products 
in  we invented a technique called smartlock  which eliminated the need for the feature connector cable 
in  we introduced the wintv r celebrity generation of tv tuner boards based on this smartlock technology  greatly improving customer satisfaction 
at the time  our cinemapro series of wintv r boards then used smartlock and other techniques to further reduce cost and improve performance 
in june of  we introduced the wintv r pci line of tv tuner boards for pcs 
these boards were developed to eliminate the relatively expensive smartlock circuitry and memory used on the wintv r celebrity and cinemapro products 
the wintv r pci used a technique called pci push and was designed to be used in the then emerging intel r pentium r market 
these pentium r based pcs had a new type of system expansion bus  called the pci bus  which allowed data to be moved at a much higher rate than the older isa bus  which the previous wintv r generations used 
the pci push technique moves the video image times per second in europe the image is moved times a second over the pci bus 
in addition to being less expensive to manufacture  the wintv r pci had higher digital video movie capture performance than the previous generations  capturing video at up to quarter screen frames per second 
with this higher performance capture capability  the wintv r pci found new uses in video conferencing  video surveillance and internet streaming video applications 
the fourth generations of our wintv r boards  introduced in  are digital tv receivers 
our wintv r d board  developed during the fiscal year and delivered to the market in the beginning of fiscal  is the first digital tv receiver for the us market which allows pcs to receive  display and record digital tv signals  in addition to watching conventional analog tv 
the software to control the digital tv reception is based on our wintv r software  which was developed during fiscal in fiscal  we also introduced the wintv r dvb board for the european market 
this board brings digital tv to pcs  and is based on the european digital video broadcast standard 
both the wintv r d and the wintv r dvb have the ability to receive special data broadcasts which some broadcasters may send along with the digital tv signal  in addition to displaying digital tv in a resizable window 
data broadcasts on digital tv are transmitted at several million bits per second 
our proprietary software can decode and display some of these special data broadcasts 
we intend to work on standardized reception and display software  if such broadcasts become standardized 
the fifth generations of wintv r products are the pvr models  developed during fiscal and introduced to the market in early fiscal the wintv r pvrs include both internal and external tv receiver products which are designed to add the ability to record tv shows to a pc s hard disk 
research and development our development efforts are currently focused on extending the range and features of the pvr products  additional externally attached tv products  and high definition digital tv products 
we are also developing more highly integrated versions of hardware products to further improve performance and cost points  and new versions of software to add features  improve ease of use  and provide support for new operating systems 
we are developing additional capabilities in the data broadcasting field  in the e commerce area  and enhancing the capabilities of our products in the apple r macintosh r market 
we currently have three research and development operations one based in our hauppauge  new york headquarters  one based in pleasanton  california and one based in singapore 
our singapore r d team is mainly focused on external tv products and on asian versions of our products 
the pleasanton  california r d operation develops the eskape tm labs products  while the new york r d operation is aimed at the digital receiver market  the pvr models  user interface software and low level drivers for all pc products 
the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business 
we maintain an ongoing r d program 
our future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we continue to invest heavily in our research and development 
we spent approximately   and  for research and development expenses for the years ended september    and respectively 
there can be no assurance that our future research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee and respond to such advances in technological developments and to successfully develop other products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies and products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
product production and suppliers we design the hardware for the wintv r and eskape tm labs products and also write the operating software to be used in conjunction with many versions of the popular microsoft r windows tm and apple r macintosh r operating system  including windows r xp  windows r  windows r me  windows r nt and windows r we subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of our products to independent third parties at facilities in various countries 
we monitor and test the quality of the completed products at our facilities in the united states hauppauge  new york  singapore  and ireland before packaging the products and shipping them to our customers 
certain component parts like tv tuners  video decoder chips and software compression chips that are essential to our business are available from a single source or limited sources 
other essential component parts which are generally available from multiple sources may be obtained by us from only a single source or limited sources because of pricing concerns 
components are subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
any availability limitations  interruption in supplies  or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our new products may initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source 
we typically evaluate and qualify additional suppliers for these components 
where a product utilizes a new component  initial capacity constraints of the supplier of that component may exist until such time as the supplier s yields have matured 
components are normally acquired through purchase orders  either issued by us or by our contract manufacturers  typically covering our requirements for a day period from the date of issue 
if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipment of completed products to us or our contract manufacturer  our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner will be adversely affected 
our business and financial performance will likely be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we have  from time to time  experienced significant price increases and limited availability of certain components that are available from multiple sources 
similar occurrences in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
manufacturing is performed by one contract manufacturer  in both europe and asia 
product design specifications are provided to insure proper assembly 
contract manufacturing is primarily done on a consignment basis  in which we provide all the significant component parts and we pay for assembly charges and for certain parts for each board produced 
some boards are purchased on a turnkey basis  in which all components and labor are provided by the manufacturer  and the manufacturing price includes parts and assembly costs 
we continuously monitor the quality of the finished product produced by our contract manufacturers 
we have qualified five contract manufacturers who are capable of producing our products to our standards  but utilize one contract manufacturer in two different locations 
during this fiscal year  this contract manufacturer handled the majority of our worldwide production 
if demand were to increase dramatically  we believe additional production could be absorbed by this and other contract manufacturers 
we also buy finished products that we have not designed but that we sell under our name on an oem basis from others parties who are not our contract manufacturers 
we currently produce boards for the majority of our european sales through a contract manufacturer in hungary 
the production is done on a consignment basis with assembly  testing and reworks being handled there 
the packaging and shipping of the product to customers is done at our ireland facility 
by shifting the production of boards sold in europe to a european facility  we save on shipping costs and duties on boards entering europe 
our asian contract manufacturer assembles products we sell in the us and internationally 
customers and markets we primarily market our products to the consumer market 
to reach this market  we sell to a network of computer retailers in the us  europe and asia and through computer products distributors 
to attract new users to our products  we run special promotions and participate in cooperative advertising with computer retailers 
we actively participate in trade shows to educate and train key computer retail marketing personnel 
most of our sales and marketing budget is aimed at the consumer market 
apart from the typical home user  we also target business users 
one example of a business application is in the securities brokerage industry where our product is primarily used to display financial tv shows in a window on a broker s pc while continuing to receive financial information 
we have sold our wintv r products on an oem basis to two large financial services information providers for incorporation into their workstations  and several independent financial institutions 
this market segment is typically project based 
we also offer our products to pc oems that either embed a wintv r product in a pc that they sell  or sell the wintv r as an accessory to the pc 
distribution to the retail market during fiscal  net sales to distributors and retailers totaled approximately  or of our net sales compared to approximately  or and  or for the years ended september  and respectively 
we have no exclusive distributor or retailer and sell through a multitude of retailers and distributors  no one of which accounted for more than of our net sales 
sales to original equipment manufacturers the oem business is one where a pc manufacturer incorporates our products into an item sold under the oem s label 
factors which could impact the expansion of our oem business include the ability to successfully negotiate and implement new agreements with oems 
our sales to oems totaled approximately   and  for the years ended september   and respectively 
we sold our products to a variety of oem customers  none of which accounted for more than of total sales in any of the three years 
sales to oem customers accounted for approximately  and of our net sales for  and  respectively 
marketing and sales we market our products both domestically and internationally through our sales offices in the united states new york and california  germany  the united kingdom  france and singapore  plus through independent sales representative offices in the netherlands  spain  italy and the people s republic of china 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  approximately  and of our net sales were made within the united states  respectively  while approximately  and were outside the united states predominately in germany  the united kingdom  france and the asia  respectively 
more information on our geographic segments can be obtained from management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we advertise our products in a number of pc magazines internationally 
we also participate in retailers market promotion programs  such as store circulars and promotions and retail store displays 
these in store promotional programs  magazine advertisements plus a public relations program aimed at editors of key pc computer magazines and an active web site on the internet  are the principal means of getting our product introduced to end users 
our sales in computer retail stores are closely related to the effectiveness of these programs  along with the technical capabilities of the products 
we also list our products in catalogs of various mail order companies and attend worldwide trade shows 
we currently have sales persons located in europe  sales persons in the far east and sales persons in the united states  located in new york and california 
we also utilize the services of manufacturer representatives retained by us on a non exclusive basis  who work with customers in certain domestic geographic areas 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with reference to a discussion on the impact seasonality has on our sales 
foreign currency fluctuations due to extensive sales to european customers with payment made to us in those local currencies and limited expenses paid in local currencies  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  we benefit from a weak dollar and are negatively affected by a strong dollar relative to the major worldwide currencies  primarily the euro and british pound sterling 
consequently  changes in exchange rates expose us to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
we attempt to reduce these risks by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with our foreign denominated sales 
the strength or weakness of the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling impacts our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings which are all expressed in us dollars 
we engage in hedging programs aimed at limiting  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations 
by selling foreign currency futures  we fix the rate of exchange at the time we enter into the contract 
we deliver these currencies to the financial institutions at a later date when we actually receive the foreign currency 
as of september   we have foreign currency forward contracts outstanding of approximately  against delivery of the euro 
the contracts expire through january  although we do not try to hedge against all possible foreign currency exposures because we can not fully estimate the size of our exposure  the contracts we procure are specifically entered into to as a hedge against existing or anticipated exposure 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the short term impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a long term strengthening position against the foreign currencies in countries where we sell our products  our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings can be adversely affected 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging program include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
for the year ended september   we recorded approximately  as an increase to net sales related to the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts 
competition our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger and smaller companies that might possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we have 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete in this emerging market against companies such as ati technologies inc and pinnacle systems  inc we believe that competition from new entrants will increase as the market for digital video in a pc expands 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse effect on us 
though management believes that the delivery of tv via the internet will become more popular in the future  we believe that tv delivered to the pc via cable  broadcast or satellite will continue to dominate 
as our products connect directly to cable  broadcast and satellite receivers  and deliver a higher quality image  we view our products as the preferred way to watch tv on the pc versus the delivery of tv via the internet 
patents  copyrights and trademarks with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that it is required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations  regardless of which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or to cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including o failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology o delays in shipment of products o excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology and o termination of our relationship with such licensors 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we shall aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we independently develop most of our products  our success will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we maintain copyrights on our designs and software programs  but currently we have no patent on the wintv r board as we believe that such technology cannot be patented 
on december   our trademark  wintv r  was registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
our hauppauge r name logo is also registered

general and administrative    total    selling general and administrative expenses decreased  from the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  increased by when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sales and promotional expense of  was mainly due to o lower advertising costs of  due to lower co operative advertising and reduced special promotions o reduced european sales office costs of  o lower commission payments of  due to lower sales o decreased compensation costs of  due to personnel reductions customer support costs decreased  mainly due to lower compensation costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to o increase in compensation costs of  related to the hiring of an mis director  an in house attorney  and the compensation costs related to the addition of eskape tm labs administrative personnel somewhat offset by personnel reductions o increased amortization costs of  mainly due to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets related to the eskape tm labs acquisition o decreased professional fees of  related to termination of outside consulting agreements and lower legal costs relating to legal fees incurred for a patent infringement suit and legal costs associated to the start up of our luxembourg operation o lower rent costs of  due to the consolidation of the eskape tm labs office in california into the hauppauge office research and development expenses decreased  or approximately 
the decrease was due to lower worldwide compensation costs and less material and contract services consumed 
litigation settlement in  we licensed a file conversion library for use in our wintv r applications 
on june   we received notice that accusoft corporation accusoft had commenced an action against us in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the district court  alleging that we o had infringed accusoft s copyright in certain software in violation of title of the united states code o had violated the terms of its software license by making excess copies of the software without paying additional royalties o used the software for unauthorized purposes on july   we and accusoft reached a settlement and release of all claims against company in exchange for payment of the settlement amount of  impairment of goodwill during fiscal  we acquired certain assets of eskape tm labs  inc this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
the fair value of the consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the assets acquired and goodwill of approximately  was recorded 
due to changing conditions during fiscal  the following events and circumstances indicated to us that our goodwill asset has been impaired and was not likely to be recovered o eskape tm labs was not profitable during fiscal and did not contribute  nor is expected to contribute  any positive cash flow stream o eskape tm labs did not fulfill its internal sales forecast for fiscal o the asset value was greater than the estimated future cash flows o at the time of the acquisition  we hired approximately of the eskape tm labs employees  including three from senior management 
only four employees remain o certain eskape tm labs products have been deemed by management as slow moving products in recognition of the above events  we recognized an impairment loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal for the entire remaining goodwill balance of we have recorded the impairment loss as a component of income loss from operations 
other income expense we had net other income for the year ended september  of  compared to net other expense for the prior year of  as detailed below year year ended ended interest income   interest expense   foreign currency transaction losses   officer life insurance proceeds  other  total other income   the increase in net other income was due to lower foreign currency transaction losses and insurance proceeds collected from a key man life insurance policy on the late mr 
kenneth aupperle  offset somewhat by interest expense on borrowings outstanding 
see legal proceedings for a discussion on certain pending litigation on the said life insurance policy 
tax provision benefit our net tax provision benefit for the year ended september  and is as follows tax benefit attributable to u 
s operations   tax expense asian operations  tax expense european operations   deferred tax asset valuation allowance  net tax provision benefit   effective october   we restructured our foreign operations 
the result of the restructuring eliminated the foreign sales corporation and established a new luxembourg corporation  which functions as the entity which services our european customers 
the new structure created separate domestic and foreign tax entities  with the new luxembourg entity paying a license fee to our domestic operation for use of the hauppauge name 
for the last two fiscal years  our domestic operation has incurred losses 
at september   our domestic operation had a deferred tax benefit of  we analyzed the future realization of the deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of fiscal and we concluded that under the present circumstances  it would be appropriate for us to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset and reduce certain income tax liabilities 
the net result was a charge to our tax provision for  the adoption of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on october  resulted in a  gain  due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of the above  we recorded a net loss of  for the year ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted loss per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted loss per share of on weighted average shares of  options to purchase  and  shares of common stock at prices ranging to and and respectively were outstanding as of september  and  respectively but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti dilutive 
results of operations september  and sales for the year ended september  were  compared to  for year ended september   an increase of  or  comprised of a increase in domestic sales and a increase in european sales 
the forces driving the sales growth were o sales of new products introduced during the latter part of fiscal  including the wintv r usb  the wintv r dvb and the wintv r go o sales contribution from our singapore office  which was opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal o sales contribution of eskape tm labs line of products for the apple r macintosh r market unit sales of the wintv r and impactvcb products for the year ended september  increased to approximately  as compared to approximately  for the prior year 
sales to domestic customers for the fiscal were of net sales compared to for fiscal sales to international customers were of net sales for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
gross profit for the year was  compared to  for the prior fiscal year  a decrease of  the gross profit percentage was for the current period compared to for the prior comparable period 
factors contributing to the decrease in gross profit margins include o decline in the euro to us dollar exchange rate o larger sales mix of lower margin product o a  reserve for certain excess inventory related to our digital tv receiver products be recorded during the quarter ended june  to reflect tepid sales of digital products the chart below illustrates the components of selling  general and administrative expenses years ended september  dollar costs percentage of sales increase increase decrease sales promotional    customer support    

general and administrative    
total    as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  increased by when compared to the prior year 
represented in dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  over the comparable prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales and promotional expense of  was mainly due to o full year compensation costs for singapore office o compensation costs for eskape tm labs personnel o increased marketing department staff o higher commission attributable to increased sales and higher effective commission rate o higher coop advertising costs due to increased sales o increased cost of european sales offices due to expanded marketing and customer support activities o increased trade show costs due to attendance at shows geared to the apple r macintosh r market customer support increased  customer support costs increases were mainly due to customer support service required to handle asian customers 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to o higher professional fees for worldwide investment  tax and litigation advice and the cost of defending a patent litigation lawsuit o hiring of in house staff counsel o contractual salary increases for senior executives o compensation of eskape tm labs administrative staff o compensation of singapore office s administrative staff o increased rent of the california office due to additional space required to house eskape tm lab personnel o full year of rent for the singapore office o direct building overhead costs of the singapore and eskape tm lab offices o increased communication costs due to singapore and eskape tm lab offices o amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the eskape tm labs acquisition o depreciation for fixed assets located at the singapore and eskape tm lab offices research and development expenses increased  or approximately 
the increase was due to the engineering compensation costs at our singapore and eskape tm labs offices 
we had net other expenses for the year ended september  of  compared to net other income for the prior year of  the decrease in net other income was primarily due to lower returns on monies invested and foreign currency losses due to the decline of the euro and british pound sterling 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended september  compared to a tax provision of  for the year ended september  effective october   we restructured our foreign operations 
the result of the restructuring eliminated the foreign sales corporation and established a new luxembourg corporation  which will function as the entity which services our european customers 
our tax provision for the year ended september  was based on this new structure 
as a result of losses attributed to domestic operations  the tax benefit derived from domestic losses offset the taxes due on income attributable to the european operation 
as a result of the above  we incurred a net loss after taxes for the year ended september  of  which resulted in a basic and diluted loss per share of  on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  compared to net income after taxes of  for the year ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted earnings per share of and on weighted average shares  adjusted for the stock split  of  and  respectively 
options to purchase  and  shares of common stock were outstanding as of september  and  but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti dilutive 
on february  our board of directors authorized a two for one stock split effected as a common stock dividend 
the stock split has been reflected retroactively for all issued common stock 
seasonality as our sales are primarily to the consumer market  we have experienced certain seasonal revenue trends 
our peak sales quarter  due to holiday season sales of computer equipment  is our first fiscal quarter october to december  followed by our fourth fiscal quarter july to september 
in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were  and of sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
to offset the above cycles  we target a wide range of customer types in order to moderate the seasonality of retail sales 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  working capital and stockholders equity position is disclosed below as of september  cash    working capital    stockholders equity    the significant items of cash provided by and cash used for the fiscal year ended september  are detailed below net loss adjusted for non cash items including an inventory reserve of   decrease in accounts receivable  inventory and other prepaid assets  decrease in deferred tax assets  decrease in income taxes receivable  decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  foreign currency translation adjustments  purchase of property  plant equipment  proceeds from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan  loan repayments  purchase of treasury stock  net increase in cash  net cash of  provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid assets of  a decrease in deferred tax assets of  a net decrease in income tax receivables of  and the net loss adjusted for non cash items the largest being an inventory reserve charged to operations of  of  offset partially by cash used to fund the net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  cash of  and  was used to purchase fixed assets and purchase treasury stock

the purchased assets expand and complement our product line into the apple r macintosh r market 
the cash price for the acquisition  which was accounted for under the purchase method  was approximately  which included  in direct transaction costs and a restrictive covenant totaling  in addition to the price paid for the acquired assets  the purchase agreement also provided for contingent additional consideration  none of which was earned 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
on april  we extended our agreement with chase manhattan bank  to provide us with a  credit facility 
the facility allows us  at our option  to borrow at prime rate  which was at september  or above the london interbank offered rate 
the facility is secured by our assets  and expires on march  as of september   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
on november   we approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to  shares of our own stock 
we will use the repurchased shares for certain employee benefit programs 
on december   the stock repurchase program was extended by a resolution of our board of directors 
as of september   we held  treasury shares purchased for  at an average purchase price of approximately per share 
as of september   we held  treasury shares purchased for  at an average purchase price of approximately per share 
we believe that our current cash position and availability under our bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating needs for at least the ensuing twelve months 
inflation while inflation has not had a material effect on our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset the effects of inflation on the costs of our products or services through price increases to our customers without experiencing a reduction in the demand for our products  or that inflation will not have an overall effect on the computer equipment market that would have a material affect on us 
euro on january   the euro was adopted in europe as the common legal currency among of the member countries of the european community 
on that date  the participating countries established fixed euro conversion rates ie the conversion exchange rate between their existing currencies and the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
a new european central bank was established to direct monetary policy for the participating countries 
prior to the adoption of the euro  we billed our european customers in german marks or british pounds  depending upon which currency the customer preferred to be billed in 
effective january   we began invoicing our customers who are located in the eleven member countries in euros 
we continue to bill customers located in the united kingdom in british pounds 
the benefits to billing customers in euros were twofold o our foreign currency hedging program was streamlined to the euro and the british pound o the pricing from country to country was harmonized  eliminating price differences between countries due to the fluctuating local currencies we handled the conversion to the euro without any material disruptions to our operations 
see item a market risk s 
derivatives and hedging activities we use derivatives to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
foreign currency forward contracts  are used to hedge the foreign currency market exposures underlying forecasted sales transactions with customers 
as of september   we have foreign currency contracts outstanding of approximately  against the delivery of the euro 
the contracts expire through january our accounting policies for these instruments are based on its designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at net fair value 
as of september   a current liability of  reflecting the net fair value of our derivatives was recorded on the balance sheet and is included as a component of accrued expenses 
for the year ended september   we recorded approximately  as an increase to net sales related to the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  which addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendor s products is a an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be deducted from revenue recognized in the vendor s income statement or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be included as a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s income statement 
eitf should be applied no later than in annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after december  the majority of vendor consideration granted by the company relates to co op advertising agreements with the company s retail customers 
based on the requirements of eitf  the company has properly included these costs as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses for all periods presented 
in the opinion of management  it appears that the effect of all other vendor consideration arrangements would not have a material effect on the statement of operations based on the requirements of the pronouncement 
in june  the financial accounting standards board finalized fasb statements no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that we recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after july  it also requires  upon adoption of sfas  that we reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas requires that we identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the quidelines in sfas sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
we are also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of sfas our previous business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method 
as of september   the net carrying value of goodwill was and other intangible assets is  amortization expense during the year ended september  was approximately  we have written off all of our goodwill as of september  and adoption of sfas and sfas will not have a material impact on us 
risks factors if tv technology for the pc or our implementation of this technology is not accepted  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 
our future success depends on the growing use and acceptance of tv and video applications for pcs 
the market for these applications is still evolving  and may not develop to the extent necessary to enable us to further expand our business 
we have invested and continue to invest significant time and resources in the development of new products for this market 
our o dependence on sales of tv and video products for the pc o lack of market diversification o lack of development of the market for our products o potential inability to remain ahead of the development of competing technologies could each have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely upon sales of a small number of product lines  and the failure of any one product line to be successful in the market could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely upon sales from our internal and external products  to generate a majority of our sales 
while we continue to develop additional products within these and other product lines  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
consequently  if the existing or future products are not successful  sales could decline substantially  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely heavily on the success of dealers and oems to market  sell and distribute our products 
if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  our sales could be reduced 
these resellers may not effectively promote or market our products or they may experience financial difficulties and even close operations 
these dealers and retailers are not contractually obligated to sell the products 
therefore  they may  at any time o refuse to promote the products and o discontinue the products in favor of a competitor s product 
also  with this distribution channel standing between us and the actual end user  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand and anticipate future demand for our products 
for example  dealers may place large initial orders for a new product just to keep their stores stocked with the newest products and not because there is a significant demand for them 
our distribution network includes several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
they also sell consumer products directly to certain retailers 
rapid change and financial difficulties of distributors have characterized distribution channels for consumer retail products 
these arrangements have exposed us to the following risks  among others o we may be obligated to provide price protection to certain retailers and distributors and  while certain agreements limit the conditions under which product can be returned  we may be faced with product returns or price protection obligations o the distributors or retailers may not continue to stock and sell our products and o retailers and retail distributors often carry competing products if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we operate in a highly competitive market  and many of our competitors have much greater resources  which may make it difficult for us to remain competitive 
our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we do 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete in this emerging market against companies such as ati technologies  inc and pinnacle systems  inc  among others 
we believe that competition from new entrants will increase as the market for digital video in a pc expands 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse affect on our ability to successfully market our products 
competition is expected to remain intense and  as a result  we may lose some of our market share to our competitors 
further  we believe that the market for our products will continue to be price competitive and thus we could continue to experience lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels for such products than in the past 
rapid technological changes and short product life cycles in our industry could harm our business 
the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business 
we will need to maintain an ongoing research and development program  and our potential future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we expended approximately   and  for research and development expenses for the years ended september   and there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee and respond to such advances in technological developments and to successfully develop additional products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies and products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
see item management s discussion and analysis risks and forward looking statements 
if tv or video capabilities are included in pcs or in operating systems  it could result in a reduction in the demand for add on tv and video devices 
although we believe that our software is a competitive strength  as operating systems such as windows move to integrate and standardize software support for video capabilities  we will be challenged to further differentiate our products 
our operating results and ability to retain our market share are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying markets for pc  tv and video products 
we may not be able to timely adopt emerging industry standards  which may make our products unacceptable to potential customers  delay our product introductions or increase our costs 
our products must comply with a number of current industry standards and practices established by various international bodies 
failure to comply with evolving standards  including video compression standards  tv transmission standards  and pc interface standards  will limit acceptance of our products by the market 
if new standards are adopted in the industry  we will be required to adopt those standards in our products 
it may take a significant amount of time to develop and design products incorporating these new standards  and we may not succeed in doing so 
we may also become dependent upon products developed by third parties and have to pay royalty fees  which may be substantial  to the developers of the technology that constitutes the newly adopted standards 
we are heavily dependent upon foreign markets for sales of our products  primarily the european and asian markets  and adverse changes in these markets could reduce our sales 
our future performance will likely be dependent  in large part  on our ability to continue to compete successfully in the european and asian markets  where a large portion of our current and potential customers are located 
our ability to compete in these markets will depend on many factors  including o the economic conditions in these regions o the stability of the political environment in these regions o adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions o the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states o restrictions on trade in these regions o the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell o changes in the regulatory environment in these regions o export restrictions and export license requirements o restrictions on the export of critical technology o our ability to develop pc tv products that meet the varied technical requirements of customers in each of these regions o our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign customers and distributors o changes in freight rates o our ability to enforce agreements and other rights in the countries in these regions o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations o difficulties assessing new and existing international markets and credit risks o potential insolvency of international customers and difficulty in collecting accounts if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are heavily dependent upon foreign manufacturing facilities for our products  primarily facilities in europe and asia  which exposes us to additional risks 
the majority of our products are built at contract manufacturing facilities in europe and asia 
our ability to successfully build products at overseas locations will depend on several factors  including o the economic conditions in these regions o the stability of the political environment in these regions o adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions o the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states o restrictions on trade in these regions o the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell o changes in the regulatory environment in these regions o import restrictions and import license requirements o our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign manufacturers o changes in freight rates o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations o potential insolvency of vendors and difficulty in obtaining materials if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations could adversely affect our results 
due to extensive sales to european customers with payment made to us in those local currencies and limited expenses paid in local currencies  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  we benefit from a weak dollar and are negatively affected by a strong dollar relative to the major worldwide currencies  especially the euro and british pound sterling 
consequently  changes in exchange rates expose us to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
we attempt to reduce these risks by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with our foreign denominated sales 
the strength or weakness of the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling impacts our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings which are all expressed in us dollars 
we engage in hedging programs aimed at limiting  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations 
by selling foreign currency futures  we fix the rate of exchange at the time we enter into the contract 
we deliver these currencies to the financial institutions at a later date when we actually receive the foreign currency 
as of september   we have foreign currency forward contracts outstanding of approximately  against delivery of the euro 
the contracts expire through january  as of september   we had realized losses from foreign currency forward contracts of  although we do not try to hedge against all possible foreign currency exposures because we can not fully estimate the size of our exposure  the contracts we procure are specifically entered into to as a hedge against existing or anticipated exposure 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the short term impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a long term strengthening position against the foreign currencies in countries where we sell our products  our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings can be adversely affected 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging program include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
additionally  there is the risk that foreign exchange fluctuations will make our products less competitive in foreign markets  which would substantially reduce our sales 
we may be unable to develop new products that meet customer requirements in a timely manner 
our success is dependent on our ability to continue to introduce new products with advanced features  functionality and performance that our customers demand 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis  that are accepted by the market  and that sell in quantities sufficient to make the products viable for the long term 
sales of new products may negatively impact sales of existing products 
in addition  we may have difficulty establishing our products presence in markets where it does not currently have significant brand recognition 
we may experience declining margins 
we may experience declining gross margins due to the following factors  among others o changes in foreign currency exchange rates o larger sales mix of lower margin products o possible future reserves for excess inventory o increases in costs charged by contract manufacturers o increases in duty and tariff rates o increases in shipping costs o lower average selling prices o increases in material acquisition costs and o different gross margins for like products in different markets consequently  as margins may decline  our profitability will be more dependent upon effective cost and management controls 
there can be no assurances that such cost and management controls can be implemented and maintained  and if implemented  that they will be successful 
see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense downward pricing pressure on our products  which could substantially impair our operating performance 
we are experiencing  and are likely to continue to experience  downward pricing pressure on our products 
as a result  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  declining average sales prices for our products 
increases in the number of units that we are able to sell and reductions in per unit costs may not be sufficient to offset reductions in per unit sales prices  in which case our net income would be reduced and we could incur losses 
since we typically negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates  we may need to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how  or if  these cost reductions can be obtained 
as a result  any current or future price reduction commitments and our inability to respond to increased price competition could result in substantially reduced revenues and significant losses 
we are dependent upon contract manufacturers for our production 
if these manufacturers do not meet our requirements  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
during fiscal  we subcontracted the manufacturing and assembly of our products to an independent third party at facilities in various countries 
relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks  including o loss of control over the manufacturing process o potential absence of adequate production capacity o potential delays in production lead times o unavailability of certain process technologies o reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs and o unexpected increases in component costs we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential manufacturing disruptions 
if our significant subcontractor becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes  we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors 
additional qualified subcontractors may not be available  or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis 
any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for our components 
if these suppliers do not meet the demand  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipment of completed products  our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected 
our business and financial performance could also be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
this could lead to an increase in the costs of manufacturing or assembling our products 
if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available  or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur excessive expenses if we are unable to accurately forecast sales of our products 
we generally ship products within one to four weeks after receipt of orders 
therefore  our sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  our expectations of future net sales and our product manufacturing and materials planning are based largely on our own estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if we obtain orders in excess of our internal forecasts  we may be unable to timely increase production to meet demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our net sales do not meet expectations  profitability would be adversely affected  we may be burdened with excess inventory  and we may be subject to excess costs or inventory write offs 
we may experience a reduction in sales if we are unable to respond quickly to changes in the market for our products 
our net sales can be affected by changes in the quantity of products that our distributor and oem customers maintain in their inventories 
we may be directly and rapidly affected by changes in the market  including the impact of any slowdown or rapid increase in end user demand 
despite efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory exposure  distribution partners and oem customers may still choose to alter their inventory levels  which could cause a reduction in our net sales 
we may accumulate inventory to minimize the impact of shortages from manufacturers and suppliers  which may result in obsolete inventory that we may need to write off resulting in losses 
managing our inventory is complicated by fluctuations in the demand for our products as well as the issues of using contract manufacturers and procuring components from suppliers mentioned above 
as we must plan to have sufficient quantities of products available to satisfy our customers demands  we sometimes accumulate inventory for a period of time to minimize the impact of possible insufficient capacity or availability of components from our manufacturers and suppliers 
although we expect to sell the inventory within a short period of time  products may remain in inventory for extended periods of time and may become obsolete because of the passage of time and the introduction of new products or new components within existing products 
in these situations  we would be required to write off obsolete inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need additional financing  and may not be able to raise additional financing on favorable terms or at all  which could limit our ability to grow and increase our costs 
we anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue our long term expansion plans  to respond to competitive pressures or to respond to unanticipated requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our failure to obtain additional financing or inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to limit our plans for expansion  incur indebtedness that has high rates of interest or substantial restrictive covenants  issue equity securities that will dilute existing stockholders holdings or discontinue a portion of our operations 
we may become involved in costly intellectual property disputes 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that it is required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations  regardless of which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or to cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including o failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology  o delays in shipment of products  o excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology  and o termination of our relationship with such licensors 
we may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we shall aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we independently develop our products  our success will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets  copyrights and trademarks and draw upon our proprietary technology without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we maintain copyrights on our designs and software programs  but currently we have no patent on the wintv r board as we believe that such technology cannot be patented 
we have no patents issued or pending that relate to our technology 
we are subject to a number of risks relating to intellectual property rights  including the following o the means by which we seek to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent others from misappropriating our technology or from independently developing or selling technology or products with features based on or similar to our products o our products may be sold in foreign countries that provide less protection to intellectual property than is provided under us laws and o our intellectual property rights may be challenged  invalidated  violated or circumvented and may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified managerial and other skilled personnel 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
our future success is dependent on our ability to manage effectively the enhancement and introduction of existing and new products and the marketing of such products 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managers  engineers and salespersons 
the loss of the services of a significant number of engineers or sales people or one or more senior officers or managers could be disruptive to product development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel  and the loss of any of their services could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could substantially interfere with our operations 
our products are complex and our market is evolving 
the success of our business depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key officers or employees could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could substantially interfere with our operations 
our dependence upon our key officers and employees is increased by the fact that they are responsible for our sales and marketing efforts  as well as our overall operations 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than mr 
plotkin  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer and the insurance coverage that we have on him may be insufficient to compensate us for the loss of his services 
we may not be able to effectively integrate businesses or assets that we acquire 
we may identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets  such as customer bases  products and technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities 
if any such opportunity involves the acquisition of a business  we cannot be certain that o we will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own o all the benefits expected from such integration will be realized o management s attention will not be diverted or divided  to the detriment of current operations o amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business o delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on the combined business  operating results and financial condition o customer dissatisfaction with  or performance problems at  an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation and o respective operations  management and personnel will be compatible in most cases  acquisitions will be consummated without seeking and obtaining stockholder approval  in which case stockholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition 
although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks 
our products could contain defects  which could result in delays in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  or failure to achieve market acceptance  or claims against us 
we develop complex products for tv and video processing 
despite testing by our engineers  subcontractors and customers  errors may be found in existing or future products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation 
we could be subject to material claims by customers  and may need to incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects 
we do not have product liability insurance to protect against losses caused by defects in our products  and we also do not have errors and omissions insurance 
as a result  any payments that we may need to make to satisfy our customers may be substantial and may result in a substantial charge to earnings 
we may experience fluctuations in our future operating results  which will make predicting our future results difficult 
historically  our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly from period to period  and we expect that our results will continue to do so 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including o market acceptance of our products o changes in order flow from our customers  and their inability to forecast their needs accurately o the timing of our new product announcements and of announcements by our competitors o increased competition  including changes in pricing by us and our competitors o delays in deliveries from our limited number of suppliers and subcontractors and o difficulty in implementing effective cost management constraints as our sales are primarily to the consumer market  we have experienced certain seasonal revenue trends 
our peak sales quarter  due to holiday season sales of computer equipment  is our first fiscal quarter october to december  followed by our fourth fiscal quarter july to september 
in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were  and of sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
accordingly  any sales or net income in any particular period may be lower than the sales and net income in a preceding or comparable period 
period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future periods 
failure to meet such expectations  should such an event occur  will likely cause our share price to decline 
our common stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to a high degree of volatility 
numerous factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including o general conditions in the pc and tv industries o product pricing o new product introductions o market growth forecasts o technological innovations o mergers and acquisitions o announcements of quarterly operating results o overall us and worldwide economic health o stability of the us and worldwide securities markets o the events of september  in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility and broad market fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of securities issued by many high technology companies in many cases for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the price of our common stock has experienced volatility not necessarily related to our performance 
our principal stockholders  executive officers and directors have substantial control over most matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders  limiting the ability of outside stockholders to control management  and any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
our principal stockholders beneficially own of our common stock not including presently exercisable stock options 
as a result  these stockholders will have substantial control over the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of stockholders  including the election of members of our board  and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business consolidation  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our stock 
this concentration of ownership could also negatively affect our stock price or decrease any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay 
no dividends and none anticipated 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
it is currently anticipated that earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of the business 
from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information provided in our securities and exchange commission filings  including information contained in this form k  may contain forward looking information 
our actual future results may differ materially from those projections or statements made in such forward looking information as a result of various risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to rapid changes in technology  lack of funds for research and development  competition  proprietary patents and rights of others  loss of major customers  loss of sources of supply for our components  non availability of management  government regulation  currency fluctuations and our inability to profitably sell our products 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile at times in response to fluctuation in our quarterly operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the computer hardware industry  seasonality of the business cycle  as well as general conditions and other external factors
