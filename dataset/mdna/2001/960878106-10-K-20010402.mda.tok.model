item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
independent power operations westmoreland energy  inc wei owns and manages interests in independent power projects 
wei  through various subsidiaries  has interests in seven such power projects  all of which are currently operational 
each project has a single power purchaser and steam host 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning wei  including specific project operational statistics 
independent power projects sell electricity through long term power contracts to utilities  or in some cases  to large industrial users 
there are three types of independent power projects cogeneration projects which provide two types of useful energy eg  electricity and steam sequentially from a single primary fuel eg  coal  small power producers which utilize waste  biomass or other renewable resources as fuel  and exempt wholesale generators ewg which provide electrical energy without the requirement to sell thermal energy or use waste or renewables as fuel sources 
wei has invested in projects that provide two types of useful energy sequentially from a single primary fuel and in projects that are exempt wholesale generators 
the key elements of an independent power project are a long term contract for the sale of electricity  long term contracts for the fuel supply  a suitable site  required permits and project financing 
cogeneration projects require another long term contract for the sale of the steam or other thermal energy 
the economic benefits of cogeneration can be substantial because  in addition to generating electricity  a significant portion of the energy is used to produce steam or high temperature water thermal energy for industrial processes 
electricity is sold to utilities and in certain situations  to end users of electrical power  including large industrial facilities 
thermal energy from the cogeneration plant is sold to commercial enterprises and other institutions 
large industrial users of thermal energy include plants in the chemical processing  petroleum refining  food processing  pharmaceutical  pulp and paper industries 
page on march   lg e westmoreland rensselaer lwr completed the sale of the rensselaer project to fulton cogeneration associates  lp fulton 
lwr received approximately  in cash as consideration for the sale of the rensselaer plant and operating contracts 
after payment of expenses and remaining debts  wei s share of the proceeds was approximately  on november   wei announced the execution of an agreement to sell its equity interest in the three virginia projects  altavista  hopewell and southampton 
the sale was subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals 
all approvals were obtained in march and closing occurred on march  the transaction is subject to a final accounting which will occur within days of closing 
wei anticipates that proceeds from the sale will approximate  in anticipation of this transaction  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in westmoreland power  inc wpi announced on february  that it had submitted a proposal to develop  own and operate  either independently or in partnership  a new state of the art mw lignite fired power plant near gascoyne  north dakota in connection with lignite vision lv

page competition the coal industry is highly competitive and the company competes principally on price and quality of coal with other coal producers of various sizes 
the company s production accounted for less than of coal production in the united states in coal fired generation was responsible for approximately of all electricity generated within the united states in the company s steam coal production also competes with other energy sources in the production of electricity 
factors such as the price of natural gas and the cost of environmental compliance will be major considerations in the decision to build and bring on line substantial new coal fired generation 
the price of natural gas has been volatile over the past year making the relative price stability in the coal market a significant contributor to renewed interest in constructing new  more environmentally friendly coal fired generation 
the company generates electricity which is sold on a wholesale basis under long term contracts to utilities under rates established in power purchase agreements and approved by regulatory agencies 
the independent power industry has grown rapidly over the past twenty years  accelerating in the s due to electric utility deregulation initiatives 
in the initial years following deregulation  prices for electricity were quite competitive  the result of low fuel prices and a relatively high level of surplus capacity that carried over from regulation 
increasing energy demand  rising fuel prices  and the failure of the growth in generating capacity to keep pace with the increase in demand for power converged in to result in the california energy crisis and higher electricity prices throughout the country 
in this new environment  there is a renewed interest in coal fired capacity and more than  megawatts of planned additions have been announced as of march the principal sources of competition in this market include traditional regulated utilities who have underutilized capacity  unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities  energy brokers and traders  energy service companies in the development and operation or energy producing projects and the marketing of electric energy  equipment suppliers and other non utility generators like the company 
competition in this industry is substantially based on price with generators seeking lower cost alternatives for providing electricity 
westmoreland terminal company is subject to competition from not only domestic providers of coal transloading services but from international competitors as well 
a significant portion of the coal shipped from dta is exported to foreign locations 
coal suppliers from australia  south africa  china  indonesia and a number of other international suppliers provide similar services 
mining safety and health legislation the company is subject to state and federal legislation including the federal coal mine safety and health act of and the amendments thereto  which prescribes mining health and safety standards 
in addition to authorizing fines and other penalties for violations  the act empowers the mine safety and health administration to suspend or halt offending operations 
page energy regulation wei s cogeneration operations are subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations  including the federal public utilities regulatory policies act of purpa 
purpa provides qualifying cogeneration facility status qf to all of wei s operations except rova i which is an exempt wholesale generator ewg 
the qf or ewg status allows those facilities to operate with certain exemptions from substantial federal and state regulation  including regulation of the rates at which electricity can be sold 
the most significant recent change in energy regulation was the passage of the national energy policy act of ep act 
companies can now apply for ewg status with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
an ewg project can provide electrical energy without the requirement to sell thermal energy to a user 
the ep act permits an ewg project to also be a qf project 
an ewg that is not a qf project must have its power rates approved 
an ewg project that is a qf project can receive avoided cost rates that are not subject to approval by ferc 
at both the national and state level  there is an ongoing debate about removing regulatory constraints and allowing competition and market forces to determine the price of electricity 
several states have already passed legislation either permitting immediate wholesale and or retail competition or providing a mechanism for transitioning to a competitive marketplace 
the commonwealth of virginia has passed legislation which allows wholesale competition to begin in and retail competition to begin in at this time  the promulgation of state legislation is not expected to have any immediate impact on existing long term power purchase agreements 
several proposed bills  calling for deregulation of the traditional utility monopolies  are pending in the us congress 
when  or if  some form of national deregulation legislation is enacted is uncertain 
protection of the environment mining operations 
the company believes its mining operations are in compliance with applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to surface mining and reclamation  and it is the policy of the company to operate in compliance with such standards 
the company maintains compliance primarily through maintenance and monitoring activities 
wri has an agreement with its mining contractor  washington group international  formerly known as morrison knudsen company  inc which owns of the stock of wri  which limits the company s maximum liability for reclamation costs associated with final mine closure 
it calls for the company to pay approximately  over a year period which began in december all remaining liability is that of washington group international  or one customer who is obligated to pay final reclamation costs under provisions of its coal sales contract 
in addition  the company paid per ton reclamation fees imposed by the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of the surface mining act of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
no reclamation fees were paid by the virginia division in  or because there was no production 
reclamation of the bullitt refuse area has been deferred pending assignment of this property to a third party 
the estimated cost to comply with virginia regulations has been accrued in the event an assignment to a third party is not consummated 
the company has also submitted information required by regulators to address a minor water leak in the refuse area 
page the surface mining act regulations set forth standards  limitations and requirements for surface mining operations and for the surface effects of underground mining operations 
under the regulatory scheme contemplated by the surface mining act  the federal office of surface mining osm issued regulations which set the minimum standards to which state agencies concerned with the regulation of coal mining must adhere 
states that wish to regulate such coal mining must present their regulatory plans to osm for approval 
once a state plan receives final approval  the state agency has primary regulatory authority over mining within the state  and osm acts principally in a supervisory role 
state agencies may impose standards more stringent than those required by osm 
the two states in which the company currently has reclamation obligations  montana and virginia  have submitted regulatory plans to osm  and these plans have received final approval 
however  since the wri mine is located on lands that were once part of coal reserves owned by the crow indian nation  the question of whether the wri operation is subject to the state of montana s regulatory oversight or osm s oversight is the source of a continuing dispute between the federal government and the state of montana 
montana and osm executed a memorandum of understanding mou in pursuant to which both osm and the state of montana simultaneously exercise regulatory oversight 
the mou continues in full force and effect 
there would be potential liability to the company in the event it  or any of its previous independent contractors  failed to satisfy the obligations created by the surface mining act 
failure to comply with the surface mining act could result in the company having its existing permits revoked or applications for new permits or permit modifications blocked 
the company has  and  of reclamation bonds in place in montana and virginia  respectively  to assure compliance with all applicable regulations 
the company projects that charges for maintenance and monitoring activities to meet environmental requirements for these operations will be minimal in future costs could change either to reflect the impact of new regulations or because presently unforeseeable conditions may be imposed on future mining permits 
in  certain amendments were enacted to the clean air act amendments 
as the first major revisions to the clean air act since  the amendments vastly expanded the scope of federal regulations and enforcement in several significant respects 
in particular  the amendments required that the united states environmental protection agency epa consider or issue new regulations related to ozone non attainment  air toxics and acid rain 
phase i of the acid rain provisions required  among other things  that certain electric utility power plants reduce their sulfur dioxide so emissions to effectively less than lbs per million btu by january  phase ii required essentially all utility power plants reduction in emissions to effectively less than lbs per million btu by january  the amendments allow utilities the freedom to choose the manner in which they will achieve compliance with the required emission standards  including switching to lower sulfur coal  scrubbing  and using so credit allowances 
the company anticipates little or no impact on its operations from the ozone non attainment provisions of the amendments 
there are not yet any regulations for air toxics but the epa has said it will pursue mercury regulations 
all coal plants could be affected 
the company cannot currently determine how it will be impacted 
independent power 
the environmental laws and regulations applicable to the projects in which wei and wpi participate primarily involve the discharge of emissions into the water and air  but can also include wetlands preservation and noise regulation 
these laws and regulations in many cases require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from federal  state and local agencies 
meeting the requirements of each jurisdiction with authority over a project can delay or sometimes prevent the completion of a proposed project  as well as require extensive modifications to existing projects 
the partnership owners of the projects in which wei has its interests have the primary responsibility for obtaining the required permits and complying with the relevant environmental laws 
page on december   the epa issued its final section rule regarding nox reductions of  tons during each annual ozone season may september 
the additional nox reductions are to begin in the rule responds to petitions filed by several northeastern states under clean air act section and seeks to control upwind nox emissions which the petitioning states allege prevent them from attaining the one hour ambient air quality standard 
ppm for ozone 
the rule approach is an alternative to regional nox reductions called for in the challenged epa nox sip call rule 
one of the most significant differences between the nox sip call and the section rule is that under section  epa attempts to regulate the individual source directly 
this circumvents state implementation plans 
the baseline for nox emissions allocations is the average of the highest date for any two years in the period 
allocation budgets will be updated in five year increments and epa will inform sources of their allocations three years in advance 
initial allocations for the three virginia projects and the rova projects beginning in were published in the december epa rule 
on march  the supreme court rejected petitions by industry groups and various states seeking review of epa s nox sip call rule 
the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit last year upheld the rule  lifted the stay on its implementation  and set new compliance deadlines for states and sources 
the court s ruling does not affect the epa s section rules  which are the subject of a separate legal challenge currently under review by the court 
at this time  the impact of rule on the company s independent power projects cannot be determined 
since the three virginia projects were sold on march   compliance with changed or new environmental standards will be the responsibility of the purchaser 
at rova  the project partnership installed a neural network in the boilers 
the neural network is intended to increase boiler efficiency and reduce nox and co emissions 
testing to determine optimal settings is currently underway 
while the rova partnership anticipates that the neural network will enable it to reduce the level of nox and co emissions from the rova i and rova ii power plants  it is too early to predict the extent of the reduction 
dominion terminal associates 
dta is responsible for complying with certain state and federal environmental laws and regulations  particularly those affecting air and water quality 
dta has employees on its staff who are responsible for assuring that it is in compliance with all laws and regulations 
in the event that dta failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations  the company may be responsible for its share of any loss incurred as a result of non compliance

page item properties as of december   the company owned or leased coal properties located in montana and virginia 
coal reserves in virginia were insignificant 
the company s estimated total coal reserves in owned or leased property in montana were approximately  tons 
in addition  the company s estimated total coal deposits in owned or leased property in montana were  tons 
a coal reserve is that part of a mineral deposit that could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the company includes in coal reserves  tons that are not fully permitted but that otherwise meet the definition of coal reserves 
a description of the permitting process and the company s assessment of that process as applied to these  tons follows the tables below 
a coal deposit is a coal bearing body which has been appropriately sampled and analyzed in trenches  outcrops  drilling and underground workings to support sufficient tonnage and grade to warrant further exploration stage work 
this coal does not qualify as a coal reserve until  among other things  a final comprehensive evaluation based upon unit cost per ton  recoverability  and other material factors conclude legal and economic feasibility 
the following tables show the company s estimated coal reserves  coal deposits and production in summary of coal reserves and production tons as of december  in thousands except sulfur percentages production percent sulfur coal reserves western operations montana steam percent sulfur applies to the production tons 
all coal reserves are proven coal reserves reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
in addition  all coal reserves are assigned coal reserves coal that has been committed by the company to operating mining equipment and plant facilities 
includes million tons that are not fully permitted but otherwise meet the definition of proven coal reserves 
summary of coal deposits as of december  in thousands of tons coal deposits western operations montana steam all coal deposits have been committed by the company to operating mining equipment and plant facilities 
page all coal reserves and coal deposits shown in the foregoing tables are leased by wri from the crow tribe of indians  which leases run to exhaustion of the mineable and merchantable coal 
the company believes that all such deposits and reserves are recoverable through existing facilities with current technology and the company s existing infrastructure 
these reserves and deposits were estimated to be  tons as of january   based principally upon a report by intrasearch  inc  an independent firm of consulting geologists  prepared in february the coal consists of two main seams and a stray seam between the upper and lower main seams 
currently  the upper seam is the only seam being mined due to a quality modification required by a significant customer 
annually  estimated remaining tons are reduced by production in the upper main seam and by the amount of coal in the lower and stray seams bypassed after mining the upper main seam 
the permit application process is subject to the regulations of the office of surface mining osm and the state of montana under its osm approved program 
among the requirements are detailed pre mining inventories of environmental resources including soils  vegetation  wildlife  hydrology and archaeology 
the application must include detailed plans for mining  reclamation and protection of hydrological resources 
the process includes an exhaustive review of the application for compliance with all applicable regulations 
after initial review of the application  the regulatory authority issues a letter reviewing deficiencies in the application to which the applicant responds by revising the application where appropriate 
this process of identifying and responding to deficiencies is repeated until all matters are cleared 
the decision document and environmental assessment are subject to formal public review  including public hearings if requested 
the process typically takes two to three years from the time the initial application is filed 
wri has chosen not to permit all of the coal deposits in its mine plan because it already has sufficient coal in its current mine plan that is permitted  given the current rate of mining and demand for its production 
it is anticipated that an application covering the estimated million tons of unpermitted reserves will be filed in the first half of based upon the company s current knowledge of the permitting process and the nature of these reserves  the company believes that there are no matters that would hinder its ability to obtain this mining permit in the future 
westmoreland resources  inc wri  owns the absaloka mine  a surface open pit coal mine located in big horn county  montana and has been the only operator on the property 
the mine is located in the upper sarpy creek drainage  miles south of hysham and miles east of hardin via route the mine is accessed from route via county road mine facilities consisting of a truck dump  primary and secondary crushers  conveyors  coal storage barn  train loadout  rail loop and support facilities including shop  warehouse  boiler house  deep well and water treatment plant were constructed beginning in late and completed in early power is purchased under a long term contract with the local utility

the total cost for the foregoing mine facilities incurred through is approximately  the company currently anticipates spending an additional  to permit the additional mining area 
the company expects that it will incur this cost no later than wri currently has no proposed program of exploration and development of this property other than obtaining future mining permits 
the first unit train coal shipment was loaded july  initially  coal was produced from the rosebud mckay and robinson coal seams  attempts were also made to recover coal from two thin rider seams identified as the stray and stray the stray is in the overburden to feet above the rosebud 
it is of erratic structure and quality  and for this reason initial efforts to recover a marketable product were unsuccessful  and it has been excavated as overburden 
the stray underlies the rosebud mckay by one to six feet 
the stray is high in ash and sulfur  and for several years it was blended with the primary seams 
such blending resulted in erratic quality  and it was abandoned in the robinson coal underlies the rosebud mckay coal by to feet 
page in  wri began supplying coal to a new generating unit 
this unit had been designed to burn sarpy creek coal from the company s absaloka mine  but almost immediately severe slagging problems were encountered 
the problem was traced to coal from the robinson seam  the plant owners notified wri that they would no longer accept robinson coal  and consequently  mining of the robinson seam was discontinued in hence  the only seam now being mined is the rosebud mckay seam  which is actually two seams separated by a thin parting ranging in thickness from a few inches to several feet 
the total aggregate coal thickness in the rosebud and mckay seams averages feet 
the coal is subbituminous c grade with an average heating value of  btu lb 
and percent sulfur as received 
when the mine was first developed  the primary overburden stripping machine was a marion dragline with a cubic yard bucket provided by the mining contractor 
at that time  wri anticipated production of million tons per year utilizing two draglines 
the second dragline  a bucyrus erie w  was purchased by wri 
by the mid s  it was clear that the market would not support a production rate of million tons per year  so the mining contractor was permitted to move its marion dragline to another mine 
the present sustainable mine capacity using the bucyrus erie w dragline is million tons per year  production of million tons in was approximately percent of capacity 
total capital cost to develop the mine and coal handling plant was approximately  through  approximately  tons of coal had been shipped to utility customers in the upper midwest for use as steam coal 
transportation is arranged and charges are paid by wri s customers 
there have been no significant problems with operation of the coal handling plant  the only significant operating problem has been spoil stability in high overburden areas 
a total of  acres have been disturbed by mining of which reclamation is complete on  acres  with the balance involved in active mining operations 
the reclamation bond  which is posted by wri and is an estimate of total cost to reclaim  is  under its mining contract with wri  the mining contractor is responsible for reclaiming the property 
after reclamation is complete  wri is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the reclaimed property until the bond is released

westmoreland energy  inc wei owns a partnership interest in westmoreland lg e partners the rova partnership 
the rova partnership s principal customer  virginia power  contracted to purchase the electricity generated by rova i  one of two units owned by the rova partnership  under a long term contract the power purchase and operating agreement 
in the second quarter of  that customer disputed the rova partnership s interpretation of provisions of the contract dealing with the payment of the capacity purchase price when the facility experiences a forced outage day 
a forced outage day is a day when rova i is not able to generate a specified level of electrical output 
the rova partnership believed that the customer was required to pay the rova partnership the full capacity purchase price unless forced outage days exceed a contractually stated allowed annual number 
the customer asserted that it was not required to do so 
in october  the rova partnership filed a complaint against virginia power seeking damages  contending that virginia power breached the power purchase and operating agreement ppoa in withholding such forced outage capacity payments 
the case was tried beginning on october  in the circuit court of the city of richmond  virginia 
on december   the circuit court entered judgment in the rova partnership s favor for the amount of  the amount that virginia power had withheld at the trial date plus interest for a total of  on december   virginia power posted its appeal bond and on december   noted its appeal of the circuit court s decision to the virginia supreme court 
interest continued to accrue on the judgement 
the virginia supreme court heard oral arguments on january  and on march  reversed the trial court s decision because the trial court had excluded certain oral evidence 
the virginia supreme court remanded the matter for further proceedings  and the circuit court set those proceedings for october  however  the trial date was postponed and not rescheduled 
from may  through october  virginia power withheld approximately  of capacity payments during periods of forced outages 
interest continued to accrue on that amount 
before the trial began the rova partnership and virginia power agreed to resolve issues regarding continuation of capacity payments on allowed forced outage days 
virginia power paid the rova partnership for the capacity payments it had withheld together with interest at the contract rate 
wei s share was  in addition to settlement of the litigation  the rova partnership and virginia power negotiated an amendment to the ppoa which clarified the provisions of the contract governing capacity payments and provides incentives for the rova partnership to keep the rova unit available and on line

liquidity outlook the major factors impacting the company s liquidity outlook are its significant heritage health benefit costs and its ongoing and future business needs 
the heritage health benefit costs consist primarily of cash payments for postretirement medical benefits and workers compensation benefits 
the company also is obligated for salaried employee pension and pneumoconiosis benefits  however  both of these future obligations have a funding surplus at present 
the company currently expects to expend in excess of  per year for postretirement medical benefits  which the company believes will remain fairly constant over the next four years and then decline to zero over the next approximately thirty five years 
in addition  the company expects to expend approximately  per year for workers compensation benefits  which will steadily decline to zero over the next approximately eighteen years 
one element of heritage health benefit costs is umwa pensions under the retirement plan 
since this plan is a multiemployer plan under erisa  a contributing company is liable for its share of unfunded vested liabilities upon termination or withdrawal from the plan 
the company believes the plan was fully funded at the time the company terminated its last umwa employees in and withdrew from the plan 
however  the plan claims that the company withdrawal occurred at a different date  and when the company withdrew the plan was not fully funded 
the plan has asserted a claim of  which the company is vigorously contesting through arbitration as provided under erisa 
the arbitration proceeding was set to begin on october   however  it has been continued until june  in accordance with the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of  the company has made monthly principal and interest payments to the plan while it pursues its rights and will continue to make such monthly payments until arbitration is completed 
included in the payments made in is interest of approximately  at the conclusion of arbitration the company may be entitled to a refund or it could be required to pay any remaining obligation in installments through under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of coal act  the company is required to provide postretirement medical benefits for umwa miners by making premium payments into three benefit plans i the umwa combined benefit fund the combined fund  a multiemployer plan which benefits miners who retired before january  or who retired thereafter but whose last employer did not provide benefits pursuant to an operator specific individual employer plan iep  ii an iep for miners who retired after january  and iii the umwa benefit plan  a multiemployer plan which benefits a miners who were eligible to retire on february   who did retire on or before september  and whose former employers are no longer in business  b miners receiving benefits under an iep whose former employer goes out of business and ceases to maintain the iep  and c new spouses or new dependents of retirees in the combined fund who would be eligible for coverage thereunder but for the fact that the combined fund closed to new beneficiaries as of july  the premiums paid by the company cover its own retirees and its allocated portion of the pool of retired miners whose previous employers have gone out of business 
page on january   in connection with its dismissal from bankruptcy  the company satisfied all of its premium obligations to the combined fund from the date of filing in december  through the end of plus interest  and made prepayments to the combined fund for its premiums for the first three quarters of normal monthly payments resumed in october beginning on that date  however  the company also began receiving credits against its combined fund premiums at a rate of approximately  per month through april   for a total of  as a result of a recalculation of premiums by the combined fund pursuant to an order of the us district court for the northern district of alabama entered july  in national coal association v 
chater 
in october  the company received notification that its normal monthly premiums would decline approximately  per month for the next twelve months due to a reduction in the combined fund s costs 
the combined benefit fund  faced with an impending solvency crisis because benefit expenses are exceeding premiums from contributing companies  again sought additional funding relief from congress in on january  the clinton administration announced it would include  in its current budget proposal for the umwa combined benefit fund to secure the long term solvency of the combined fund 
under the sponsorship of senators byrd and rockefeller of west virginia  the house and senate conference committee subsequently approved in  as a part of the interior and related agencies appropriations bill  a transfer of  of accumulated interest in the abandoned mine land reclamation fund aml to the combined fund 
as a part of its report  the conference committee noted that this was a short term solution and urged that the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the matter work with the concerned parties to insure the long term solvency of the combined fund 
the conference committee went on to admonish the parties not to ask for additional funding from aml in the future 
the coal act authorized the trustees of the umwa benefit plan to implement security provisions for the future payment of benefits pursuant to the act 
the trustees set the level of security for each company at an amount equal to three years benefits 
in westmoreland s case this obligation was stayed during the pendency of the bankruptcy 
the company secured its obligation to provide retiree health benefits under the plan by posting a bond in the amount of million in which was increased to million in the company s bonding agent required collateral equal to of the bonded amount 
the bond is collateralized by us government backed securities in the amount of  at december  the bond amount and the amount to be secured are to be reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis 
page over the course of  varying versions of a medicare prescription drug benefit have also generated a great deal of interest by both political parties  their candidates and in the press around the country 
while health care generally remains one of the most discussed matters of public policy  politicians have begun to focus increasingly on the specific concern of meeting the pharmaceutical needs of the united states medicare eligible population 
congress included billion over five years in its fy budget to fund some form of prescription drug benefit 
several bills were introduced in both the house and senate during the last session of congress 
the house passed a prescription drug benefit  however  no prescription drug legislation made it out of the senate before adjournment 
in the recently completed presidential election  both major parties had platform planks that promised some form of prescription drug legislation 
on january   president bush s prescription drug plan for low income seniors was introduced in congress 
the plan is titled the immediate helping hand and proposes providing block grants to the states to decide on an individual state by state basis how to help offset the constantly escalating cost of prescription medicine 
it is expected that other versions of a prescription drug benefit will be introduced in this session of congress 
among the most likely alternatives to president bush s proposal will be either an amendment to existing medicare statutes that specifically adds a federally mandated prescription drug benefit or a comprehensive re write of medicare and inclusion of a prescription drug benefit 
a medicare prescription drug benefit that covers medicare eligible beneficiaries covered by the coal act could address one of the company s largest costs 
westmoreland currently expends over million per year on retirees health care costs and over of that expense is for prescription drugs 
there is no assurance at this time what  if any  proposal will be enacted into law or what effect  if any  that it may have on the company s obligation 
the company is closely monitoring energy deregulation and other industry trends 
at both the national and state level  there is an ongoing debate about removing regulatory constraints and allowing competition and market forces to determine the price of electricity 
several states have already passed legislation either permitting immediate wholesale and or retail competition or providing a mechanism for transitioning to a competitive marketplace 
the commonwealth of virginia has passed legislation which allows wholesale competition to begin in and retail competition to begin in at this time  the promulgation of state legislation is not expected to have any immediate impact on existing long term power purchase agreements 
several proposed bills  calling for deregulation of the traditional utility monopolies  are pending in the us congress 
when  or if  some form of national deregulation legislation will be enacted is uncertain 
the company is unable to predict the effect of deregulation on wei or wri 
in addition to deregulation  current industry trends include increased demand for new generating capacity  the need for stabilizing fuel and electricity costs  and pressure to reduce harmful emissions into the environment 
the company s experience in developing new generating capacity and current coal production capability may enable the company to take advantage of these trends 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully capitalize on  or that any profitable opportunities will arise  as a result of these trends 
the company s principal current sources of cash flow from operations include cash distributions from its independent power projects  dividends from wri and interest earned on cash reserves 
management believes that available cash should be sufficient to pay the company s heritage health benefit costs and fund its ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company is engaged in two acquisitions  the coal businesses of montana power and knife river  that  if consummated  the company anticipates should enhance operating earnings and cash flow 
the company expects to finance these acquisitions from various sources including lender financing and the proceeds from the settlement of the rova forced outage day issue  the sale of the virginia projects and sales of existing non strategic assets and or asset refinancing 
page sources of possible additional liquidity include the possible reimbursement of amounts paid to the umwa pension plan  the sale of non strategic assets  remaining overfunded amounts from the black lung trust and the salaried pension plan  ongoing increased project earnings from a revised and mutually beneficial ppoa for rova following the renegotiation of the ppoa  a recovery from washington group international for dragline repairs and the effect of any future legislation that causes medicare to cover the cost of prescription drug benefits for the company s retirees 
the company agreed to secure its obligations to the umwa funds under the master agreement for a period of six years by providing a contingent promissory note note 
the original principal amount of the note is million  the principal amount of the note decreases to million in and terminates in the note is payable only in the event the company does not meet its coal act obligations  fails to meet certain ongoing financial tests specified in the note  or fails to maintain the required balance of million in an escrow account established in connection with the note 
if the cash flows from the rova project exceed million per year after  then the million held in escrow will be returned to the company at the beginning of capital expenditures in  and included approximately  to repair the dragline at wri 
all of these expenditures substantially increased the productive life of the dragline and therefore  were capitalized 
the company believes  under the terms of wri s agreements with washington group international  formerly known as morrison knudsen  that washington group international is responsible for all dragline repairs 
wri has expended these amounts to assure continued  uninterrupted production at wri  and has demanded reimbursement from washington group international for the full cost of the repair 
washington group international has reimbursed wri for approximately  of these costs 
on march   wri commenced litigation against washington group international in the united states district court for the district of montana seeking  among other things  payment by washington group international of approximately million of dragline repair costs paid or expected to be paid by wri  plus accrued interest 
the company has not recorded any amounts that may be recoverable from washington group international in its financial statements 
on march   washington group international announced that it was facing a severe near term liquidity problem due to a delay in resolving purchase price adjustments in connection with an acquisition 
the company cannot currently determine what impact  if any  this problem may have on its operations or this litigation 
dividends and growth preferred stock dividends at a rate of per annum were paid quarterly from the third quarter of through the first quarter of the declaration and payment of preferred stock dividends was suspended in the second quarter of in connection with extension agreements with the company s principal lenders 
upon the expiration of these extension agreements  the company paid a quarterly dividend on april  and july  pursuant to delaware law  the preferred stock dividend was suspended in the third quarter of as a result of the recognition of losses related to the idling of the virginia division and the subsequent shareholders deficit

following the dismissal of its bankruptcy case  the company undertook an extensive review  analysis and development of its strategic plan for growth 
among the issues the company considered in the course of its strategic planning were the market for energy in the united states  including forecasts under various economic assumptions about levels of demand for different sources of power  forecasts about levels of supply for different sources of power  and forecasts as to cost and price data 
the continuing impact of de regulation on the energy market 
the continuing impact of laws and regulations designed to protect the environment on the supply of and demand for power produced from different sources  and the opportunities that presently exist and that may arise to balance the country s desire for affordable energy and a clean environment 
the business opportunities that presently exist and that the company believes will arise in the energy sector 
the availability of over million of net operating loss carryforwards nols  to shield the company s future profits from federal income taxation and thereby increase the return the company receives from profitable investments as compared with the return a tax paying entity that cannot shield its income from federal income tax would receive 
alternatives to optimize the value of the company s assets  including sales of assets  if the price is favorable to the company  recognizing that the company s asset base delivers tax shielded cash flow to the company and are burdened by the coal act  both of which make these assets more valuable to the company than to potential tax paying buyers 
page potential sources of additional cash that might become available to the company  including the possible reimbursement of the company s expenditures to repair the dragline at westmoreland resources  inc and the other potential sources described in the liquidity outlook section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial effect of possible legislative developments  such as a prescription drug program  that could substantially reduce the company s obligations under the coal act since over of the company s post retirement medical costs are for retiree prescription drug benefits 
the importance of properly prioritizing and sequencing the company s efforts  given the fact that the company does not currently have sufficient cash to meet all of its different strategic business objectives  including the tax advantaged expansion of the company through acquisitions  and the ability to pay accumulated and future stock dividends 
the company s strategic plan focuses on expanding the company s existing core operations and acquiring profitable businesses in the energy sector where america s dual goals of low cost power and a clean environment can be effectively addressed 
the company is seeking to do this in niche markets that will minimize exposure to competition  maximize stability of long term cash flows and provide opportunities for synergistic operation of existing assets and new opportunities in the energy sector 
the availability of the company s net operating loss carryforwards  nols  which the company hopes to fully utilize through its growth strategy  is governed by section of the internal revenue code of code 
the code limits the utilization of a corporation s nols if an ownership change within the meaning of the code an ownership change occurs with respect to that corporation 
in general  an ownership change occurs if  among other things  percent shareholders within the meaning of the code percent shareholders increase their percentage ownership of the corporation s stock by more than percentage points over any three year period 
a percent shareholder is any person who owns percent or more of the value of the corporation s stock  and the value of the corporation s stock is the sum of the market values of all of the corporation s outstanding shares 
the company continues to monitor the ongoing status of ownership changes by percent shareholders and cautions its current shareholders and potential investors that the creation of new percent shareholders or trading by existing percent shareholders could negatively impact the calculation of the ownership change 
the company believes that  based on public information currently on file  there has not been an ownership change  but that the percentage of change is approximately as of december  if the percentage of change begins to approach the limitation  then the company may ask shareholders for their assistance in minimizing the change 
if the change exceeds the limitation  the company may be unable to use a portion of its nols
