results of operations the company continues to experience improved profitability as sales and gross profit margins continue to rise 
gross profit margins rose from in to another record breaking high of in net sales for were million  up million from fiscal while operating expenses in increased by million 
part of the operating expense increase was due to the increase in sales while the acquisition of the tandy leather assets in november also accounted for a portion of the increase 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased a mere over the dramatic improvement in profitability resulted primarily from o continued increases in retail sales  o the opening of two new sales units in  and o increased efficiency in the purchasing of merchandise 
the results of operations in were encouraging as gross profit margins reached a high of and operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales over the prior year 
during  total sales were million  while operating expenses were million

operating results for the fourth quarter of revealed slightly better results in profit margins at compared to the total year 
fourth quarter revenues were up modestly  from the same period last year due to tandy leather s december sales of  without tandy leather s sales contribution  sales for the quarter would have been down  due to decreases in export sales and certain wholesale categories primarily shoe care repair 
as discussed in previous years  the reduction in sales to shoe care repair customers is intentional as this industry historically produces very low margins 
operating costs were up from the fourth quarter of due to the addition of operating expenses from tandy leather operations for the month of december 
obviously  we anticipate that the operations acquired from tandy leather will represent a larger portion of the operational results for income statement comparison the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss analysis of compared to change change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income loss    other income expense    income loss before income taxes    n a income tax provision benefit    n a net income loss    n a revenues sales for continued its growth trend with a increase over with our retail sales and asc programs accounting for the majority of the increase 
we also opened two new sales distribution units in  located in dallas and houston  tx 
tandy leather s sales for december added  to the total for the year 
the primary sales growth is currently being generated from the retail customer market 
retail sales in increased from in years past  we have focused our marketing efforts primarily toward the wholesale customer 
beginning in  as a result of other companies intentional decrease and or elimination of their marketing efforts toward the retail customer  we began to specifically target retail customers in our direct mail advertising program as well as in our sales distribution units 
as a result  we have experienced significant growth in this market 
tandy leather s mail order and internet sales is dominated by retail sales and even though our sales for weren t impacted due to the timing of the acquisition  we expect it to contribute significantly to our retail sales growth in the future 
our asc program generated sales of approximately million in  with approved asc s in the program 
this compares to approvals for approximately  in tandy leather has an authorized dealer program in place as well with dealers worldwide and is expected to generate strong sales in this area going forward 
our export sales decreased slightly in as well as specific wholesale categories shoe care repair primarily  but were offset by increases in sales in our other core markets saddle and tack  small manufacturers  etc 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales for totaled million or of sales resulting in a gross profit margin of 
this compares to a cost of sales percentage of and gross profit margin of in the increase in retail sales continues as the explanation of the improvement in gross profit margins from year to year as well as an increased efficiency in the purchasing of product from vendors due to volume discount and tougher price negotiations 
operating expenses increased million or compared to the increase is primarily the result of increases in payroll costs increased number of employees due to new sales distribution units opened in  tandy leather acquisition  managers bonuses based on higher profits earned at the sales distribution units  and advertising costs increased efforts toward retail customers via direct mailing pieces 
other income expense other expenses were down from this reduction is due to the decrease in interest expense as the average outstanding debt balances continue to drop 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes was of income before taxes compared to in the reduction in the percentage resulted because the non deductible expenses goodwill amortization that has increased the effective percentage of taxes to income in the past were relatively unchanged in amount  but much smaller as a percentage of income before taxes due to the significant increase in income before taxes in analysis of compared to change change net sales     cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income loss    other income expense    income loss before income taxes    n a income tax provision benefit    n a net income loss    n a revenues the company experienced encouraging growth in net sales during primarily due to the absorption of a portion of tandycrafts market share that it abandoned during the year and the early signs of renewed interest in the western apparel and craft markets 
in addition  we opened four new sales distribution units in  located in portland  or  billings  mt  austin  tx  and tucson  az 
it has been our experience that the western and craft industries are subject to fads  to some extent 
movies  entertainers  etc 
have a great impact on the popularity of western apparel in particular 
the key to success in the craft industry  oversimplifying of course  is being the first company with a popular idea whether it be wearable art  photo albums and scrapbook creations  etc 
as a result  the company s success in selling to these two industries depends to a point on the latest successful craft idea  what is popular at the box office  or who won entertainer of the year 
we believe we are seeing the beginnings of these two industries popularity on the rise 
partially offsetting the sales increases in retail  western and craft markets was the continued reduction of sales of certain low margin items 
because of the historically low margins earned in our shoe care repair product line  we intentionally eliminated a large portion of the line 
this reduced sales to this industry by approximately million from we compensated for this reduction with the development and implementation of our new asc program 
the asc program began in april  and as of december   we had approximately approved ascs 
in  the ascs generated sales of over  sales in our institutional prisons and prisoners  schools  hospitals  etc 
and other core markets saddle and tack  semi professional hobbyists  small manufacturers showed steady and positive growth trends as well 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales for totaled million or of sales 
the percentage increase over was 
the impact of this increase becomes evident when compared to the increase in sales 
the gain in gross profit to sales in resulted in a gross profit percentage of the highest in the company s history compared to in the most significant factor supporting this improvement is the increase in our retail business as retail sales historically produce the highest profit margins 
in  we experienced a jump in retail sales from operating expenses increased million or compared to this increase is a result of higher payroll costs resulting from higher sales  esop contribution management s desire to reward employees for the company s financial improvement  managers bonuses as a result of higher profits earned at the sales distribution units  and professional fees 
other income expense other expenses were down from this reduction is primarily in interest expense due to the decrease in average outstanding debt balances in as compared to provision benefit for income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes was of income before taxes due to  of non deductible expenses  principally amortization of goodwill

there  wfbc consented to the tandy leather transaction and amended certain financial tests to reflect the acquisition of the tandy leather assets and to make previously contemplated extensions of these tests 
among these changes  the amendment dropped a minimum debt service requirement in the existing credit agreement  and increased the percent of eligible inventory book value and the total amount of eligible inventory both computed as provided in the credit agreement that can be included in the company s borrowing base under the credit agreement

an increase of one percentage point in the prime rate would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings
