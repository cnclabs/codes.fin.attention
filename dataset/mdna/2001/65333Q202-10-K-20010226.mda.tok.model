presentation of financial information in the quarter ended december   ventro decided to restructure and shut down its two wholly owned marketplaces  chemdex and promedix 
accordingly  results of continuing operations for ventro for the years ending december   and have been restated to exclude the results of operations of chemdex and promedix 
the results of operations for chemdex and promedix have been accounted for as discontinued operations 
overview ventro corporation the company or ventro or we  formerly known as chemdex corporation  is a technology and service provider to business to business bb marketplaces 
ventro offers a variety of products and services through our marketplace solutions that give companies developing online bb marketplaces the power to transition from concept to liquidity and profitability by integrating third party technology and software  hosting services  consulting services and marketplace development services 
during the company operated two wholly owned marketplaces  chemdex and promedix  and provided technology and services to four minority owned marketplaces 
in the quarter ended december   ventro announced that it was restructuring and would discontinue operations of both chemdex and promedix 
aggregate non recurring charges of approximately million were recorded for the year ended december  in connection with restructuring and discontinued operations 
ventro is now focused on providing technology and services as a marketplace service provider to its existing four minority owned marketplace customers and new marketplace customers 
ventro does not expect to own significant equity interests in new marketplace customers 
technology and services provided to our four existing minority owned marketplaces are generally provided at cost  and do not result in revenues being recorded 
amounts related to billed and collected costs of services provided are recorded by ventro as offsets to related operating expenses incurred 
the company anticipates providing additional technology and services as requested by existing marketplaces  but does not anticipate that billings for such services will result in future revenues 
the company anticipates that contracts with new marketplace customers will provide for billings and revenues in connection with technology and services provided in the design  building  launching and operations of marketplaces 
ventro will record revenue for new marketplace customers in accordance with the terms of the individual customer contract 
revenues will be recorded when the company provides technology and services in accordance with the agreement  the price of the services is fixed or determinable  all contracted services have been delivered  significant contractual milestones have been achieved  contractual contingencies have been eliminated  customer acceptance criteria have been met  and payment is reasonably assured 
amounts billed and cash received in excess of revenue recognized will be included as a customer advance 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design and development of our technology 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses  as well as advertising  trade shows and promotional expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our administrative personnel and fees for outside professional advisors 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development and new technologies to develop new services and further enhance our offerings 
in addition  an important part of our strategy is to build our sales  technical and operational resources 
we believe success requires expanding our customer base  moving into new locations  achieving anticipated levels of utilization of our leased third party data center space and technology infrastructure  providing a high level of customer service and being able to scale our capabilities through automation technology 
we expect to continue to incur net losses both on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term 
as such  a delay in the recognition of revenue or offsets of gross costs from one or more contracts could cause variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in greater net losses in a given quarter than expected 
effects of various accounting methods on our results of operations the various interests that we have acquired in companies are accounted for under three broad methods consolidation  the equity method and the cost method 
the applicable accounting method is generally determined based on our voting interest in a company 
consolidation 
companies in which we directly or indirectly own more than of the outstanding voting securities are generally accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting 
under this method  a company s accounts are reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions are eliminated 
equity method 
companies whose results we do not consolidate  but over whom we exercise significant influence  are generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
whether or not we exercise significant influence with respect to a company depends on an evaluation of several factors including  among others  representation on the company s board of directors and ownership level  generally interest in the voting securities of the company including voting rights associated with our holdings in common  preferred and other convertible instruments in the company 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the earnings or losses of these companies is included in the equity income loss section of the consolidated statements of operations 
cost method 
companies not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
under this method  our share of the earnings or losses of these companies is not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments for impairment 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from our consolidated statement of operations in thousands years ended december  operating expenses research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative    restructuring and other charges  amortization of deferred stock based compensation total operating expenses    operating loss    interest expenses  interest income and other  net   gain on investment  loss on investment in strategic partners  write down of investment  equity loss  loss from continuing operations    discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax    loss on disposal  net of income taxes  loss from discontinued operations    net loss    revenues 
ventro has generated no revenues from the company s service operations to date  revenues were derived primarily from product sales through the chemdex and promedix marketplaces  and their operations have been discontinued 
the company anticipates that any contracts that the company may enter into with new marketplace customers will provide for billings and revenues in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and other expenses associated with developing  updating  and enhancing software in support of our marketplace customers 
research and development expenses from continuing operations were million during fiscal research and development expenses in and related to operations that were discontinued in december we believe that our success is dependent in large part on continued enhancement and development of our marketplace provider solution 
accordingly  we will continue to enhance and improve our internet based purchasing solution as well as develop and introduce new solutions and services as we transition to becoming a marketplace service provider 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional expenses  as well as  payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in enterprise sales activities and enterprise account management

the deferred stock compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the stock options 
the company recognized   and  in stock compensation expense from continuing operations during the years ended december   and  respectively

interest income and other 
interest income and other  net  increased to million for from million and  for and  respectively 
interest income and other  net has been derived primarily from earnings on investments in cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest increased during and the second half of due to increased cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering on july  and the offering of convertible subordinated notes in march provision for income taxes 
we incurred net losses and accordingly did not record a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
certain future changes in our share ownership  as defined in the tax reform act of and similar state provisions  may restrict the utilization of carryforwards 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to our lack of earnings history 
net loss from continuing operations 
as a result of the changes described above  the net loss from continuing operations was million in for the year ended december   million of the amounts billed and collected from marketplace companies were offset against gross operating expenses 
an additional million of amounts billed and collected were not offset but were deferred pursuant to acceptance provisions of a service agreement with marketmile 
discontinued operations in december  the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan and announced the shut down of all business operations associated with the company s life sciences and specialty medical products marketplaces 
the shutdown of chemdex  promedix and specialtymd is expected to be completed no later than march  earlier in  the company had acquired the businesses represented by promedix and specialtymd 
these transactions were effected in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
for promedix  the purchase consideration was million shares of the company s common stock valued at million 
the entire promedix purchase price was allocated to intangible assets 
for specialtymd  the purchase consideration was million shares of the company s common stock valued at million 
of the specialtymd purchase price  million was allocated to net tangible liabilities and the remainder to intangible assets 
the company wrote off as part of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations million of intangible assets  comprised of million related to the promedix and specialtymd acquisitions and an additional million related to certain chemdex contracts 
no interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations 
in addition  general corporate overhead has been allocated to continuing operations for all periods presented 
revenues from discontinued operations were million  million and  for  and  respectively 
gross profit from discontinued operations was million  million and  for  and  respectively 
the company adopted staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab and emergency issues task force eitf  recording revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent in the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab and eitf did not change the company s revenue reporting because chemdex and promedex act as principals purchasing products from their suppliers and then reselling them to their customers 
chemdex and promedix assume the risks and rewards of ownership and  consequently  the company included gross revenues from sales of product and related shipping fees  net of discounts and provisions for sales returns and other allowances  in net revenues of discontinued operations 
the loss on disposal principally includes the write off of intangibles of million  severance pay  write down of equipment to its estimated recoverable amounts of million  and accruals for estimated liabilities and estimated operating losses of million during the phase out period for the discontinued businesses 
liquidity and capital resources prior to ventro s initial public offering in july we funded our operations primarily by the private sale of our equity securities  through which we raised approximately million 
in july  we completed the initial public offering of our common stock and realized net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
in april  we completed an offering of convertible subordinated notes and realized net proceeds of million 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash as well as million in equipment financing arrangements 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  the net cash used in operating activities during this period was primarily due to net losses  which were partially offset by non cash charges of depreciation and amortization of deferred compensation  amortization and write downs of intangible assets  and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued compensation 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  the company had cash purchases of million of computer equipment  computer software  office furniture and leasehold improvements during for continuing operations 
in addition  during the company had net sales and maturities of million of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities during resulted primarily from the sale of preferred stock and proceeds from our initial public offering 
cash from financing activities during resulted primarily from the sale of preferred stock 
net cash provided by financing activities during resulted primarily from the offering of convertible subordinated notes in march 
in december  we announced a plan to restructure our business by shutting down our wholly owned marketplaces  chemdex and promedix in order to focus on our a business model 
under the new model  ventro plans to generate billings and revenues as a marketplace service provider  providing technology and services to its four existing minority owned marketplace customers  as well as to new marketplace customers 
in connection with this restructuring  the company also plans to reduce its current level of operating expenses by reducing marketing efforts  terminating or restructuring existing marketing arrangements and reducing current employee and contractor staffing levels 
the company s restructuring plan and the shutdown of chemdex and promedix were designed to lower our current level of operating expenses by reducing its marketing efforts  terminating or restructuring existing marketing arrangements and significantly reducing our current employee and contractor staffing levels 
while the shutdown of chemdex and promedix and other ventro restructuring will reduce the company s cash operating expenses  the company s ability to adequately reduce cash used in operations  and ultimately generate profitable results from operations  is dependent upon successful execution of its new business plan  and signing of new marketplace customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in signing customers or in billing existing or future customers adequate amounts for technology and services provided  or reducing operating expenses in the future 
the inability to successfully implement the restructuring and cost reduction measures could have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to successfully transition to our new business plan and to remain in business 
on february   our board of directors authorized us to commence a tender offer for all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
the tender offer for the notes will be made at in cash per  principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to  but not including  the date of payment 
the purpose of the tender offer is to retire all of the outstanding notes in order to reduce our annual interest expense and eliminate the need to repay or refinance the notes at maturity in we currently anticipate that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   together with our equipment lease lines and taking into account the cash that will be needed to repurchase our convertible subordinated notes  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing  or other arrangements to fund operations and potential acquisitions  if any  over a long term basis until we achieves profitability  if ever 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which the company will be required to adopt for the year ending december  sfas establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
because we currently hold no derivative financial instruments and does not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 
opinion 
fin clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the application of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the eitf published its consensus on eitf no 
 application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
eitf no 
states that a software element covered by sop is only present in a hosting arrangement if the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on their own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software 
ventro has historically treated its hosted services as service arrangements  which is in accordance with the guidance contained in this pronouncement 
our hosting arrangements generally do not provide customers with the contractual right to take possession of the software 
risk factors an investment in our securities involves significant risks  including those described below 
these risks relate to our new business model  our ability to generate revenues and gain operating efficiencies  our history of losses  our high debt level  our ability to hire and retain key personnel  our reliance on the technology of others  the possible delisting of our common stock  the need to respond to rapid technological change  possible claims against us for products liability or failure to comply with government regulations and our need to raise new capital to expand 
our actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth below and included in other portions of this document 
recently  we have made a substantial change in our business model and shut down the businesses that had provided all of our revenues since inception 
in december  we initiated a major restructuring that will substantially change our business 
the board of directors decided to shut down the chemdex and promedix marketplaces  laid off employees and restructured certain ventro operations 
for the year ended december   the loss from discontinued chemdex and promedix operations aggregated million  and we recorded charges of million related to ventro restructuring and write off of certain ventro investments 
the chemdex and promedix marketplaces were the source of all of our revenues since inception 
in the future  ventro will seek to provide technology and services to marketplaces that are owned by others 
to date  we have not finalized our product offering or pricing or begun providing services to any marketplace in which we are not an equity owner 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining new marketplace customers at all  or on terms that will permit us to achieve profitability in the future 
our restructuring may not successfully reduce operating expenses 
our restructuring plan and the shutdown of chemdex and promedix were designed to lower our current level of operating expenses by reducing our marketing efforts  terminating or restructuring existing marketing arrangements and significantly reducing our current employee and contractor staffing levels 
while the shutdown of chemdex and promedix and other ventro restructuring will reduce cash operating expenses  our ability to adequately reduce cash used in operations  and ultimately generate profitable results from operations  is dependent upon successful execution of our new business plan  and signing of new marketplace customers 
as of december   we had working capital of million and had an accumulated deficit of million 
during we used cash in operating activities of million  purchasing million of equipment for continuing operations and invested million in marketplace companies 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our new business plan or reducing our operating expenses in the future 
our inability to successfully implement the restructuring and cost reduction measures could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to successfully transition to our new business plan and to remain in business 
we have a limited operating history  and our marketplace service provider model is new and unproven which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
the success of our marketplace service provider model is based on securing new independent marketplace customers 
this business model is new and not proven and depends upon our ability  among other things  to acquire and deploy a sufficient number of customers to achieve profitability  develop and market solutions that achieve broad market acceptance by our customers and their marketplace users  successfully provide high levels of service quality to our existing customers as we expand the scale of our business  develop new technology and service offerings that complement our existing offerings  reduce the costs of many of the processes required to deploy and support our customers  extend our technology to support a wide range of hardware and software to meet the needs of a large range of customers with a variety of needs  forecast the amount of leased third party data center space and infrastructure that we will require in order to accommodate customer growth  acquire or license third party technologies and services that we require to deliver our services  overcome publicity related to our public announcements of the shutdown of our chemdex and promedix marketplaces  and potentially harmful publicity if current minority owned marketplaces commence litigation against us or otherwise express dissatisfaction with our products and services  that may adversely affect potential customers willingness to use our services  and acquire marketplace customers operating in industries we have not served to date and provide them quality services 
we may not successfully address these risks 
if we do successfully address these risks  additional risks related to factors that are outside our control may prevent us from realizing sufficient revenues or profit margins to reach or sustain profitability 
for example  existing and future marketplace customers may be unsuccessful in convincing users to adopt internet based purchasing solutions 
our marketplace customers may experience difficulties because of users comfort with existing information gathering and purchasing habits  existing direct supplier relationships  the costs and resources required to switch purchasing methods  and the need for products and product information not offered through marketplaces 
marketplaces may experience problems with users as a result of security and privacy concerns  general reticence about technology or the internet or the failure of the market to develop the necessary infrastructure for internet based communications  such as wide spread internet access  high speed modems  high speed communication lines and computer availability 
we may be unsuccessful in executing on current marketplace customer contracts  and may be unsuccessful in negotiating contracts with new marketplace customers that allow us to bill and collect for our services 
the nature of technology and services provided by us does not allow us to readily define services to be performed  products to be delivered and criteria for ensuring that our customers are satisfied with the technology that we provide and the services that we perform 
our ability to deliver services to our existing marketplace customers  bill for these services and collect amounts billed is  in part  dependent upon the interpretation of existing contractual language 
we have experienced disputes with existing marketplace customers  and anticipate future contractual disputes  primarily related to billings for  and delivery of  technologies or services not specifically defined or priced under existing contractual language 
in addition  the competitive marketplace for our services  size of potential marketplace customers  and early stage of our product and the market will make contractual negotiations difficult with potential new marketplace customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating contracts with new marketplace customers that will allow us to profitably deliver services under the contract  bill for such services  ultimately collect amounts that are billed  and record revenues 
our agreements with marketmile require us to pay penalties and provide credits if we fail to meet certain performance criteria 
the company s agreements with marketmile provide certain uptime and performance guarantees regarding the quality of our services 
our scheduled uptime guarantee assures marketmile that  except during scheduled maintenance windows or during service outages or degradations caused by marketmile  outages to its internet operations will be repaired within specified time limits 
our performance guarantee assures marketmile that if the responsiveness of internet operations falls below mutually agreeable levels  we will restore the site to the appropriate levels within specified time limits 
if we fail to meet these guarantees  we may be required to credit a percentage of the fees paid for our services  generally up to a maximum of of all service fees accrued in the month of the outage 
in addition  our contract with marketmile provides a minimum pool of million in damages in the event the company fails to achieve certain defined contractual performance milestones 
as of december  the company has not issued any credits to marketmile  or other marketplace customers  in connection with system uptime or performance 
at december   the company had recorded approximately million of billings to marketmile as a customer advance 
these billings will not be reflected as reductions of operating expense by the company until such time as all contractual milestones with marketmile have been successfully achieved  and uncertainty regarding potential penalty provisions has been eliminated 
we have a history of losses  no significant revenues  expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow  and we may never be profitable 
we have not generated any revenues from our marketplace service operations to date 
we have derived revenues solely from product sales through our chemdex and promedix marketplaces  and their operations have been discontinued 
in addition  services provided to our two existing minority owned marketplace customers have been provided at cost and amounts billed and collected have been reflected as reductions of related operating expenses 
therefore  it is unlikely that we will recognize any revenue in the future related to these marketplaces 
it is anticipated that contracts with new marketplace customers will provide for billings and revenues in accordance with the terms of the contracts  although there is no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying new customers  or negotiating commercially acceptable contractual provisions that will allow recording of revenues 
accordingly  we have little basis upon which to predict future operating results 
we have spent significant funds to develop our current services  lease third party data center space  procure hardware  software and networking products and develop our operations  research and development and sales and marketing organizations 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow and have not achieved profitability 
our net losses in each of the three years ended december  were million  million  and million 
as of december   we had stockholders deficit of million 
there can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable 
one of our current marketplace customers is dissatisfied with our product and may commence litigation 
we entered into a technology and services agreement with broadlane in the contract set forth a timetable for providing functionality and establishing a marketplace to provide e commerce solutions for the high volume  hospital and medical supplies market 
broadlane and its majority shareholder  tenet healthcare  have informed the company that they are dissatisfied with the company s e commerce solution 
as a result  broadlane and tenet have told the company that they will seek termination of the technology and services agreement and rescission of the issuance of broadlane shares to the company 
if either of these events were to occur  the company s financial position would be harmed and its opportunity to seek additional customers could be impaired 
we are a highly leveraged company 
in april  we incurred million of indebtedness in connection with the sale of our convertible subordinated notes 
the annual interest payments on the notes are million 
our cash on hand is significantly less than the face amount of the notes  and the company during used million more cash in operations than it generated 
accordingly  we need to generate substantial amounts of cash from operations to fund interest payments and to repay the principal amount of this debt when it matures  while at the same time funding our working capital needs 
if we do not have sufficient cash to repay our debts as they become due  we may be unable to refinance our debt on reasonable terms or at all 
the notes could be declared immediately due and payable if we do not make timely interest payments 
if we cannot meet our debt obligations  we may not be able to develop and sell new products and services  respond to changing economic conditions adequately or otherwise fund our business 
we have recently lost the services of four senior executive officers 
robin abrams  our chief operating officer  james stewart  our chief financial officer  and martha greer  our vice president of marketing  have notified the company they will be leaving on or before march  additionally  in december pierre samec  who had previously served as our chief information officer and had most recently served in a consulting capacity with us  resigned his position 
these individuals have been key to the management and operation of our business  and if we are unable to hire qualified personnel  or promote existing personnel  to replace them  our business will be adversely affected 
our financial performance and workforce reduction may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel 
in connection with the transition to our new business model and in order to reduce our cash expenses  in december we announced the shutdown of our promedix and chemdex marketplaces and related workforce reductions 
in addition  recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of the stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive to have better prospects 
additionally  in order to successfully implement our marketplace service provider model  we will need to hire new personnel 
specifically  our services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at a limited number of key people within our prospective customers organizations 
because the market for our services is new  many prospective customers are unfamiliar with the services we offer 
as a result  our sales effort requires highly trained sales personnel 
we need to expand our marketing and sales organization in order to increase market awareness of our services to a greater number of organizations and  in turn  to generate increased revenue 
to meet this need we are in the process of developing our direct sales force  and we require additional qualified sales personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel we need 
moreover  even after we hire these individuals  they require extensive training in our infrastructure services 
in addition  we must continue to develop our marketing channels 
if we are unable to continue to expand our sales operations  retain our current employees and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our services  which may prevent us from generating revenue and achieving and maintaining profitability 
if our common stock price falls below and remains under  or if we otherwise fail to comply with nasdaq rules  our common stock is likely to be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could eliminate the trading market for our common stock 
if the market price for our common stock falls and remains below per share  our market capitalization falls and remains below million or we otherwise fail to meet the criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be deemed to be penny stock 
during  our common stock traded below per share  and on february  the closing price was 
if our common stock is considered penny stock  it would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practices on broker dealers who sell our securities 
for example  broker dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale 
also  a disclosure schedule must be prepared prior to any transaction involving a penny stock and disclosure is required about sales commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities 
monthly statements are also required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock 
because of these additional obligations  some brokers may be unwilling to effect transactions in penny stocks 
this could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock and your ability to sell the common stock 
we are highly dependent on intellectual property and exposed to legal liability for infringement 
our success and ability to compete depends on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
although we do not have any registered trademarks  we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect our source code for our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
although we have patent applications pending  no patents have been issued to us  which may significantly limit our ability to protect the proprietary aspects of some of our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results 
our business involves the licensing of our technology to our customers and joint venture partners 
most licenses to our partners are exclusive within such partner s industry or business  thus limiting to some extent our ability to use and license our technology in the future 
pursuant to our existing licenses  we have made certain representations and warranties and agreed to indemnify our licensees against claims of infringement by third parties 
thus  we may be exposed to a significant risk of liability for intellectual property infringement claims by others 
our success and ability to compete also depend on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology  our business and operating results would be significantly harmed 
we are highly dependent on products licensed or purchased from third parties 
as part of our normal operations  we purchase  license or lease software  hardware and networking products from third party commercial vendors 
we obtain most of our components from third parties on a purchase order basis 
these products may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of these products could result in delays in the sale of our services until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  procured and integrated  and these delays could result in lost revenues 
some of the key components of our services are available only from sole or limited sources 
for example  only hardware manufactured by two vendors is compatible with the solaris operating system  which is a key component of our infrastructure 
further  to the extent that the vendors from whom we purchase these products increase their prices  our gross margins could be negatively affected 
our business involves the licensing of our technology to our customers and joint venture partners 
most licenses to our partners are exclusive within such partner s industry or business  thus limiting to some extent our ability to use and license our technology in the future 
pursuant to our existing licenses  we have made certain representations and warranties and agreed to indemnify our licensees against claims of infringement by third parties 
thus  we may be exposed to a significant risk of liability for intellectual property infringement claims by others 
claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others or the misappropriation of our own intellectual property could detrimentally affect our business 
our intellectual property is important to our business  and we seek to protect it with confidentiality provisions in our contracts  nondisclosure agreements with third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees  but we cannot be certain such measures will adequately protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
we are subject to government regulation that exposes us to potential liability and negative publicity we currently rely upon our suppliers to meet all packaging  distribution  labeling  hazard and health information notices to purchasers  record keeping  licensing  and other regulatory requirements applicable to our business during the entire transaction 
our reliance on suppliers regulatory due diligence assessment of purchasers and the compliance by suppliers and purchasers with applicable governmental regulations may not be sufficient if we are held to need our own licenses 
for example  if we are held to be a seller or a distributor of regulated products because we did take legal title  we may have inadvertently violated some governmental regulations by not having the appropriate license or permit or by not properly maintaining appropriate records  and may be subject to potentially severe civil or criminal penalties and fines for each offense 
thus  while we attempt to transfer responsibility for compliance with these requirements to suppliers through our legal arrangements with them  that transfer may be inadequate  unclear  or incomplete 
we are aware that some of our prior sales may have been made in the absence of our having the requisite local  state  or federal license or permit or in the absence of required record keeping or other compliance 
we may be subject to potentially severe civil and criminal penalties and fines for each of these sales  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to these prior sales  we are unable to verify that our suppliers have in the past complied  or will in the future comply  with the applicable governmental regulatory requirements  or that their actions are adequate or sufficient to satisfy all governmental or other legal requirements that may be applicable to our sales 
we could be fined or exposed to significant civil or criminal liability  including monetary fines and injunctions  and we could receive potential negative publicity  if the applicable governmental regulatory requirements have not been  or are not being  fully met by our suppliers or by us 
negative publicity  fines and liabilities could also occur if an unqualified person  or even a qualified customer  lacks the appropriate license or permits to sell  use or ship  or improperly receives a dangerous or unlicensed product through the chemdex or promedix marketplace 
we do not maintain any reserves for potential liabilities resulting from government regulation 
it is also possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or interpreted in the united states and abroad with particular applicability to the internet 
we may be exposed to product liability claims we face potential liability for claims based on the type and adequacy of the information and data that we obtain from suppliers and make available  and the nature of the products that we sell and distribute utilizing the internet  including claims for breach of warranty  product liability  misrepresentation  violation of governmental regulations  defamation  libel  slander  or publishing otherwise inaccurate  biased  incomplete  or misleading information  or information that invades or violates privacy  confidentiality  patents  copyrights or other rights  and other commercial and tortious claims 
we also bear the risk of liability for product loss  spill  or release  and resulting damages to persons and property during delivery by the supplier to the customer and return by the customer to the supplier 
we do not pass through the manufacturers warranties on the products we distribute 
however  we bear the risk of loss of revenue from the product sale if a purchaser does not pay for a defective product 
we also bear some risk if our suppliers have not obtained appropriate approvals for products regulated by the fda and other governmental agencies  or do not comply with the requirements relating to those products or approvals 
the failure to obtain or comply with those requirements or approvals  or other failures by these products themselves  could result in costly product recalls  significant fines and judgments  civil and criminal liabilities  and negative publicity 
although we maintain general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover some claims  penalties  or spills  is subject to policy limits and exclusions  and may not be adequate to fully indemnify us or our employees for any civil  governmental or criminal liability that may be imposed 
furthermore  this insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates in the future 
any liability not covered by our insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage could have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our liability is potentially greater with respect to sales to users and others that are not affiliated with an enterprise customer 
because we facilitate the sale of many different life sciences and specialty medical products by suppliers  and publish information about medical products and procedures  we may become subject to legal proceedings regarding defects in these products or the information provided 
in addition  we take title to certain products between the period of time after the supplier has delivered the product but before the product has been accepted by the customer 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  and result in significant liability 
we also seek to rely upon our suppliers  pass on all regulatory responsibilities  and obtain indemnification from our suppliers against some of these claims 
however  the transfer of liabilities and indemnification may be inadequate  unclear  or incomplete  the scope of the indemnification is limited  a few of our suppliers have not agreed to indemnify us  and some suppliers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us in the future 
in addition  we are not in a position to monitor our suppliers activities or the accuracy of the information they provide to us 
therefore  we are exposed to liability and risk for these claims 
we plan to operate in a new  highly competitive market  and our inability to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies would limit our ability to gain significant market share 
our target market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
it will likely be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants  as there are few barriers to entry 
we face competition from a diverse group of companies 
competition may come from providers of co location or website hosting and related services  and providers of internet systems integration and professional services such as csc  eds  ibm global services  accenture and pricewaterhousecoopers 
in addition  providers of various software products to our marketplace  such as ariba  commerce one  oracle and sap may expand their existing product offerings to be competitive with us in the future 
our current and potential competitors may develop superior e commerce platforms that achieve greater market acceptance than our solution 
many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors can undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands  products and services  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to customers  potential employees  distribution partners  commerce companies and third party suppliers 
in addition  substantially all of our prospective customers have established long standing relationships with some of our competitors or potential competitors 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to expand our customer list and user base  or retain our current customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate our operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
important factors that could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially include the timing of obtaining new customers length of sales cycle  the timing of deploying services for new customers  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses and capital expenditures  costs related to the various third party technologies we incorporate into our services  utilization of our leased third party data center space and technology infrastructure  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  and the amount of credits that we may be required to issue to our customers if we fail to deliver our services pursuant to our scheduled uptime and performance guarantees 
due to these and other factors  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
in future quarters  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based largely on our growth plans and estimates of future billings and revenues 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
the deployment cycle for marketplaces is complex  and we may not be able to successfully streamline their construction which could increase our costs and harm our operating results 
moreover  if our technology fails to work properly or if we are unable to continue to expand the scope of its capabilities  the quality and reliability of our services may decline  and we may be unable to grow our revenue at the rate required to sustain our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to increase the functionality of our technology  we will not achieve anticipated efficiencies and we will need to hire additional personnel to support our customers  which would cause our cost of revenue to increase and our margins to decline 
we may require additional capital for our operations  which could have a negative effect on your investment 
we currently anticipate that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to fund rapid expansion  to pursue customer sales and implementation  to develop new or enhanced solutions and services  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary businesses  technologies or services 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution and these securities may have powers  preferences and rights that are senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our business transition  promote our brand identity  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures 
any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
our services depend upon the continued availability of leased data center space from third parties 
we lease and intend to continue to lease data center space from third parties 
if we are unable to acquire new or retain existing third party data center space  our growth could be slowed and our business could be harmed 
in the event that we cannot obtain adequate data center space from third parties  we could also be required to build our own data center facilities  which would require significant capital expenditures  could delay the expansion of our operations and change the nature of our business model 
in addition  because we are required in most circumstances to enter into contracts for data center space in advance of customer commitments  if we are unable to increase our customer base at the rate that we anticipate in the geographic areas in which we have contracted for space  our operating results will suffer 
recently  some of our existing data center providers have begun marketing new services beyond their core co location or website hosting offerings 
to the extent that these providers expand the scope of these new services to address some of the functionality we currently provide  this may limit our ability to renew existing agreements and enter into new agreements for data center space with existing or new data center providers 
our operations depend upon our ability and the ability of our third party data center and network services providers to maintain and protect the computer systems on which we provide our services 
the performance of our server and networking hardware and software infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation and our ability to process transactions  provide high quality customer service and attract and retain customers  suppliers  users and strategic partners 
currently our infrastructure and systems are located at one site at exodus communications in sunnyvale  california 
we anticipate adding a mirror site at a different  distant location 
until then  we depend on our single site infrastructure and any disruption to this infrastructure resulting from a natural disaster or other event could result in an interruption in our service  and  if sustained or repeated  could impair our reputation and the attractiveness of our services 
although our data center and network providers maintain back up systems  a natural disaster  human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss  sabotage or similar disruption at any of their sites could impair our ability to provide our services to our customers until the site is repaired or back up systems become operable 
some of our data center providers  as well as our corporate headquarters  are located in northern california near known earthquake fault zones 
our systems and the data centers we use are also vulnerable to damage from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
recent events in california have demonstrated that power outages and reduced availability of electricity may be likely in the coming years 
we do not have a formal disaster recovery plan or alternative provider of hosting services 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that could occur 
in addition  because many of our customers depend upon their internet operations to help run their businesses  they could be seriously harmed if the services we provide to them work improperly or fail  even if only temporarily 
our inability to maintain the quality of our services at guaranteed levels could cause our reputation to suffer  hinder our ability to obtain and retain new customers  force us to divert research and development and management resources  cause a loss of revenue or subject us to liabilities  any one of which could adversely affect our results and harm our business 
the inability to expand our system s capacity may limit our growth 
our inability to add additional software or to upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems  or network infrastructure to timely accommodate increased demands for website traffic or transaction volume could have adverse consequences 
these consequences include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer service for marketplaces we build or service 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or to integrate smoothly any newly developed or purchased technologies with our existing systems 
these difficulties could harm or limit our ability to expand our business 
our services business involves a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle 
the sales cycle for the target customers of the services we provide tends to be lengthy and because the marketplace service provider model is a new one for the company  and we have no new customers to date  our sales cycle may be somewhat longer than those of our more established competitors 
additionally  should we target more large enterprises and traditional businesses as potential customers  our sales cycle may be longer than is typical for sales to internet based businesses 
the unpredictability of the length of our sales cycle could make it difficult to forecast revenue and plan expenditures 
additionally  any delays in deployment of our services related to our inexperience with a type of business or the size or complexity of the account would delay our ability to recognize revenue from that account 
such delays could adversely affect our financial results 
our business will suffer if we do not enhance or introduce new services and upgrades to meet changing customer requirements 
the market for internet technology and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new hardware  software and networking product introductions and internet related technology enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
any delays in responding to these changes and developing and releasing enhanced or new services could hinder our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers 
in particular  our technology is designed to support a variety of hardware  software and networking products that we believe to be proven and among the most widely used 
we can make no assurances  however  that present and future customers will continue to use these products 
even if they do  new versions of these products are likely to be released and we will need to adapt our technology to these new versions 
we must  therefore  constantly modify and enhance our technology to keep pace with changes made to our customers hardware and software configurations and network infrastructures 
if we fail to promptly modify or enhance our technology in response to evolving customer needs and demands  our technology could become obsolete  which would significantly harm our business 
in addition  frequent changes in the hardware  software and networking components of the systems and services we provide could adversely affect our ability to automate the deployment process  a key element of our business strategy 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new services  or deliver enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  we may be unable to meet the growing demands of our existing and potential customers 
in addition  as we introduce new services or technologies into existing customer architectures  we may experience performance problems associated with incompatibility among different versions of hardware  software and networking products 
to the extent that such problems occur  we may face adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our services or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
security risks and concerns may decrease the demand for our services  and security breaches may disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to our customers 
our services involve the storage and transmission of business critical  proprietary information 
if the security measures we or our third party data centers have implemented are breached  our customers could lose this information and we could be exposed to litigation and possible liability 
anyone who circumvents these security measures could misappropriate business critical proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
in addition  computer hackers could introduce computer viruses into our systems or those of our customers  which could disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to customers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
our security measures and those that our third party data centers provide may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business and reputation will suffer if these breaches occur 
if customers require that we customize our services beyond what we currently provide or that we perform systems integration work for them  our operating results may suffer 
we currently do not customize the delivery of our services beyond the technology platforms that we currently support  and we do not provide general systems integration work for our customers 
some businesses may prefer more customized applications and services than our business model contemplates 
if we do not offer the desired customization  there may be less demand for our services 
conversely  although we may choose to provide such services as a marketplace service provider  providing customization of our services would increase our costs and could reduce our flexibility to provide broad based services to a wide range of customers 
accordingly  increased demand for customization of our services increase our operating costs 
if our customers require service for technology platforms other than those we currently support  we may not be able to provide service to those customers 
if we do choose to support additional platforms  the added complexity of our systems may increase our costs  decrease the reliability of our services and limit our ability to scale 
this may harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 
we are committing significant resources to our international operations and sales and marketing activities 
for example  we commenced operations in europe in and we ultimately plan to expand our presence more broadly in the asia pacific region 
we have limited experience conducting business outside of the united states  and we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions 
we will be subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs  lengthen our sales cycles and require significant management attention 
these risks include increased costs and expenses related to the leasing of foreign  third party data center space  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  the added complexity and expense of adapting technology to systems and equipment designed to operate outside the united states  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies  general economic and political conditions in international markets  potentially adverse tax consequences  including complications and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and unusual or burdensome regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to requirements 
if one or more of these risks were to materialize  our financial results could suffer 
internet related stock prices are especially volatile and this volatility could cause our stock price to fluctuate dramatically  which could result in substantial losses to investors 
the stock market and specifically the stock of internet related companies have been very volatile 
this broad market volatility and industry volatility may reduce the price of our common stock  because our business is internet based without regard to our operating performance 
our common stock reached a high of and traded as low as during  and on february  the last reported sales price of the shares on the nasdaq was 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related primarily to changes in interest rates 
however  we do not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting of mainly income securities with maturities of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk our sales from inception to date are included in discontinued operations 
the sales have been made to us customers and  as a result  we have not had any exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
however  in future periods  we expect to sell in foreign markets 
as our sales will be made in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets
