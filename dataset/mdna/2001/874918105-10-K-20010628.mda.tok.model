the gross margin percentage was maintained as costs related to personnel and infrastructure increased in conjunction with increased revenue during fiscal human resources and benefits application services gross margin increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but as a percentage of corresponding revenue  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease in gross margin percentage is principally due to costs associated with transitioning personnel from our customer premises systems business in anticipation of possible future growth in human resources and benefits application services 
customer premises systems gross margin decreased to million  or of corresponding revenue  in fiscal from million  or of corresponding revenue  in fiscal  as revenues declined 
the decrease in gross margin percentage is due to certain fixed costs that remain as we shift our business focus to the work number services and human resources and benefits application services

discontinued operations in august  we determined to divest our database and document services businesses and  accordingly  reflected the results of operations of such businesses as discontinued operations 
a provision of  was made as of june   to reflect the anticipated loss from operations until the time of disposal 
on january   we sold substantially all of the assets of the document services business to sterling direct  inc  the largest customer of the division 
the sales price  after giving effect to the post closing adjustments  was  the net assets sold totaled approximately  as of march  and  we provided additional provisions for loss  net of tax  in the amount of  and  respectively

revenues from human resources and benefits application services are seasonally higher during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to the nature of the services being provided 
our second and third fiscal quarters correspond to the third and fourth calendar quarters 
we believe many of our clients permit employees to update their benefit choices only annually  in most cases during the last calendar quarter 
we expect revenues generated from our new w express service will be particularly affected by seasonality  as revenue relating to this service should principally be earned in our fourth fiscal quarter 
our revenues have increased on a quarter by quarter comparison in fiscal over fiscal due to the addition of new clients seeking to outsource non core functions 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have financed our operations through cash flows from operations 
our working capital was million at march  and million at march  total working capital increased in fiscal due principally to our earnings for the year 
our accounts receivable decreased from million at march  to million at march  the decrease was due to improved account collections  offset by increased revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to as a percentage of our total revenues for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  accounts receivable at fiscal year end decreased from at march   to at march  as a result of improved account collections 
our capital expenditures  principally purchases of computer equipment  were million in fiscal at march   we had no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facilities and operating leases  but would expect capital expenditures to increase slightly during the next fiscal year 
in november  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our stock in the open market over the following two year period 
in november  this program expired  thereafter  our board of directors authorized a new program allowing us to repurchase up to  shares of our stock in the open market over the following two year period 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares for million  consisting of  under the plan and  under the plan 
cumulative shares repurchased amount to  under the plan and  under the plan 
except for the  shares remaining in the treasury at march   all shares repurchased have been reissued in connection with employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we began paying quarterly dividends on our common stock  declaring a total of approximately  in dividends during each of the last three quarters of fiscal we believe that our working capital  together with our anticipated cash flows from operations  should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we have a  line of credit facility with a commercial bank  all of which was available at march  outstanding borrowings  if any  bear interest at london inter bank overnight rate plus and will be secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit facility expires march  subsequent to the end of fiscal year  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to the proposed public offering of  shares of our common stock  including  shares of selling shareholders 
we also intend to grant an over allotment option to the underwriters covering  shares 
we intend to use the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes  which may include potential acquisitions 
the registration statement has not yet become effective  and we may not sell  nor may we accept offers to buy  the securities prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective 
this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state 
when available  a written prospectus pertaining to the offering may be obtained from cibc world markets  one world financial center  liberty street  new york  new york or from adams  harkness hill  inc  state street  boston  massachusetts we cannot assure you that such offering will be completed on favorable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting of federal agency debt obligations 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
our current line of credit facility with a commercial bank provides for borrowings that bear interest at libor plus 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at march  we currently believe that the effect  if any  of changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material
