overview goto operates an online marketplace that introduces consumers and businesses that search the internet to advertisers who provide products  services and information 
advertisers participating in our marketplace include retail merchants  wholesale and service businesses and manufacturers 
goto facilitates these introductions through our search service  which enables advertisers to bid in an ongoing auction for priority placement in our search results 
priority placement means that the search results appear on the page ranked in descending order of bid price  with the highest bidder s listing appearing first 
each advertiser pays goto the amount of its bid whenever a consumer clicks on the advertiser s listing in our search results 
advertisers pay goto for each click through  so advertisers bid only on keywords relevant to the products  services or information that they offer 
because each advertiser chooses the bid amount and advertisement placement that is optimal for its business  we believe the goto marketplace provides advertisers with a cost effective way to target consumers 
consumers access the goto search service primarily through our affiliates  a network of web sites that have integrated goto s search service into their sites or that direct consumer traffic to our site 
consumers can also access goto s search service directly through goto s web site 
goto also operates an online comparison shopping service called goto tm shopping 
currently  goto intends to exit the comparison shopping business  and accordingly we are evaluating strategic alternatives 
goto also operates an online resource for merchants to place and manage their products with other auction sites or services  called goto tm auctions 
currently  goto is evaluating strategic alternatives for goto tm auctions  including an equity partner or the possibility of a sale of this portion of our business 
a large and growing number of consumers using the goto search service at our affiliates web sites across the internet and at our web site increases the incentive for advertisers to bid in the goto marketplace 
in turn  a breadth of relevant advertiser links increases the value to consumers of using the goto search service 
consequently  we believe a large and active base of advertisers  consumers and affiliates in our marketplace can stimulate growth in bidding  searches and paid introductions 
goto was incorporated in september and has a limited operating history 
we launched a proof of concept version of our search service in the fiscal year ended december  our pay for performance tm service was announced in february  and following further proof of concept testing  was officially launched in june in october  goto announced its intent to change its corporate name and expects to make such a change within goto has devoted significant resources to launching and expanding its search service  including developing an infrastructure and building a management team 
goto s losses for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
those losses include non cash amortization of goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of cadabra and auctionrover and the acquisition of the assets of searchup  representing approximately million  million and  respectively  and the impairment write down of goodwill in for cadabra and auctionrover of approximately million and million  respectively 
a significant component of our expenses consists of costs incurred to attract consumers to our service through goto s affiliate network 
we expect to continue to rely upon these sources for a significant proportion of consumer searches conducted on our service 
our future success is dependent upon increasing the revenue we derive from this traffic 
acquisitions on january   goto acquired cadabra  an online comparison shopping service 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization  goto acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and assumed all outstanding options to acquire shares of capital stock of cadabra  for million in cash and  shares of goto common stock  including  shares to be issued upon the exercise of options assumed by goto 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as determined by goto at the date of the acquisition 
the operations of cadabra have been included in our results of operations since the date of the acquisition 
the total purchase price of the acquisition was approximately million and consisted of cash of million  goto common stock of million valued at the closing price of goto s common stock on the date the exchange ratio was set  net of expected proceeds from the exercise of cadabra stock options assumed by goto  and acquisition costs of million  primarily for investment banking  legal and accounting costs 
of the purchase price  million was assigned to in process research and development which was expensed immediately following the consummation of the acquisition  million was assigned to the value of purchased technology and other intangibles and will be amortized on a straight line basis over three years and million was allocated to the net tangible assets 
the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill in the amount of million and was scheduled to be amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  goto recorded an impairment charge on the goodwill and intangible assets from the acquisition of cadabra of the entire remaining balance of goodwill and intangible assets  which was approximately million 
on may   goto acquired auctionrover  an online resource for auctions 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization  goto acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and assumed all outstanding options to acquire shares of capital stock of auctionrover for  shares of goto common stock  including  shares to be issued upon the exercise of options assumed by goto 
based on the price of goto common stock on the date the exchange ratio was set  the purchase price was valued at approximately million  which consisted of goto common stock of million  net of expected proceeds from the exercise of stock options assumed by goto and including acquisition costs of approximately  for legal and accounting services 
the purchase price was determined by arms length negotiations between the parties 
timothy draper  a former director of goto  is affiliated with certain entities that were principal stockholders of auctionrover 
of the purchase price  million was assigned to the value of purchased technology and other intangible assets and was to be amortized on a straight line basis over three years and  was allocated to the net tangible assets 
the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill in the amount of million and was scheduled to be amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
in accordance with sfas  in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  goto recorded an impairment charge on the goodwill and intangible assets from the acquisition of auctionrover of the entire remaining balance of goodwill and intangible assets  which was approximately million 
on october   goto acquired substantially all the assets of searchup  which did not have significant business operations 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  goto acquired searchup s operational web site  registered urls  trademarks and patent on its url position manager 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the total consideration for the assets consisted of  shares of goto common stock  valued at approximately million  as determined by the closing price of goto s common stock on the purchase date 
goto allocated the purchase price to the intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as determined by goto 
it is anticipated that such amounts will be amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
international expansion we launched our service in the united kingdom in november our international expansion will require continued investment  and we expect to incur significant costs to build internal infrastructure and grow our advertiser and affiliate bases overseas 
therefore  in order to scale and expand more rapidly  our strategy is to align with partners that may provide key distribution channels for our products as well as additional financing 
once such a deal is consummated  goto will then evaluate entering into other foreign markets 
at this stage  the structure of potential partnerships is not known  but it is intended that any partner will take an equity position in goto s international venture  which could potentially reduce the start up losses that we would record 
the results of our international operations are consolidated and  if appropriate partnerships with terms acceptable to us are not obtained  we will continue to consolidate all of the results from our international operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  in thousands revenue   cost of revenue   gross profit   operating expenses marketing  sales and service   general and administrative   product development   amortization of deferred compensation   write off acquired in process research and development  amortization of intangible assets  impairment of intangible assets  loss from operations   interest income  net   other income  loss before provision for income taxes   provision for income taxes net loss   revenue 
revenue is generated primarily through paid introductions  that is  the number of click throughs that users make on advertiser s listings 
revenue is recognized when earned based on click through activity to the extent that the advertiser has deposited sufficient funds with us or collection is probable 
revenue also consists of banner advertising  which constitutes less than percent of our revenue for the year ended december  goto has no barter transactions 
banner advertisement revenue is recognized when earned under the terms of the contractual arrangement with the advertiser or advertising agency  provided that collection is probable 
the number of paid introductions for each of the last ten fiscal quarters is as follows number of paid introductions for the quarter ended million december  million september  million june  million march  million december  million september  million june  million march  million december  million september  the average price per paid introduction results from advertisers online bidding for priority placement in the search results 
the average price per paid introduction for each of the last ten fiscal quarters is as follows average price per paid introduction for the quarter ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  average price per paid introduction decreased from the quarter ended september  to the quarter ended december  we believe this was primarily due to increased traffic at our site  which doubled during the quarter  as a result of the recent deals signed with aol  terra lycos  and altavista 
the rapid increase in traffic that resulted primarily from these deals caused advertisers who bid on goto s top to listings to spend their allocated budget more quickly than previously 
because the aol  terra lycos and altavista implementations serve goto s top to listings  advertisers with listings in these positions received traffic more quickly than prior to goto entering into these agreements 
as these advertisers budgets were depleted  the listings with lower bids rose higher in the search results even though the advertiser in the lower bid positions did not increase their bid 
goto believes that continued growth in advertisers and increased pay for performance advertising budgets will promote competition and allow our average price per paid introduction to stabilize or grow over the next year 
we believe that after our large increase in traffic  we may experience a drop in the average price per paid introduction and may subsequently experience a recovery period in which the price may continue to drop slightly or be flat for a period of time 
there is evidence that advertisers are increasing their budgets with goto  since the average spend per advertiser in the quarter ended september  was and rose to  in the quarter ended december  second  to a lesser extent  the softness in the online advertising market has resulted in lower bids and  as a result  a lower average price per paid introduction 
we believe the quarterly number of paid introductions and average price per paid introduction listed above are not necessarily indicative of future results and that the periods prior to the three month period ended september  are not relevant because our service was only in its initial stage 
it is difficult to forecast the future growth of the average price per paid introduction  as advertisers  rather than goto  determine the price paid 
we do not anticipate our historical revenue growth rate to continue 
our growth rate and results depend on our ability to continue to increase the number of advertisers who use our service  the amount our advertisers spend on our service and the number of consumers who use our service 
we anticipate these variables to fluctuate  affecting our growth rate and results 
revenue was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of continued growth of our marketplace and the corresponding participants  our advertisers and the number of consumers using our product 
we do not anticipate our historical revenue growth rate to continue as a percentage of growth as expressed on a year to year basis 
our growth is dependent on obtaining additional traffic and increasing the average price per paid introduction 
during the year ended december   approximately of goto s total traffic came from portals aol  terra lycos and altavista  and approximately of the total traffic came from the browsers microsoft internet explorer and netscape  and approximately of the total traffic came from other affiliates 
in august  goto and aol entered into a month distribution agreement under which aol displays goto s listings on the search results pages of aol  aol 
com and netscape s netcenter 
in november  goto and terra lycos entered into a three year distribution agreement under which goto s listings were added to lycos 
com and hotbot search results 
in november  goto and altavista entered into an month distribution agreement under which goto provides altavista s search service users with goto s listings on select search results pages of altavista 
we recently extended our existing agreement with microsoft for an additional year  which will allow for continued traffic from their internet explorer and internet explorer browsers 
microsoft delivered a diminishing level of traffic to us in compared to  and we anticipate that we eventually will receive no traffic from internet explorer and internet explorer our agreement with netscape was renewed in july of and will expire on june  even though we currently anticipate growth in traffic from existing and new affiliates  we must renew our affiliate agreements or replace this traffic with other sources and grow our advertising base  otherwise  our revenue may be materially  adversely affected 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with serving our search results  maintaining our web site and fees paid to outside service providers that provide and manage our unpaid listings 
costs associated with serving our search results and maintaining our web site include depreciation of web site equipment  co location charges for our web site equipment  software license fees and salaries of related personnel 
cost of revenue was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increased database and hardware capacity requirements  an increase in the number of personnel required to support our web site and increased fees paid to outside service providers 
we anticipate cost of revenue to continue to increase as our traffic and number of advertisers increase 
marketing  sales and service 
marketing  sales and service expenses consist primarily of our payments to affiliates  advertising and promotional expenditures  and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  customer service and sales functions 
marketing  sales and service expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased distribution of our search service  and the hiring of additional personnel for marketing  sales and service functions 
we believe that continued investment in marketing  sales and service and in the increased distribution of our search services  which includes our recent agreements with aol  altavista and terra lycos are critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect these costs to continue to increase in the future 
in august  we entered into a month distribution agreement under which aol displays goto s listings on the search results page of aol  aol 
com and netscape s netcenter 
the agreement calls for a guaranteed payment by goto of million over the term of the agreement 
in november  we entered a three year distribution agreement under which our premium listings keyword search service has been added to lycos 
com and hotbot search results 
also in november  we entered into an month distribution agreement under which we provide altavista s search service users with goto s premium listings on select search results pages of altavista 
costs associated with payments to affiliates were million for the year ended december   compared to million year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  facilities  professional services  including legal  insurance and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of increased headcount and related expenses  including facilities and increased personnel related insurance costs  as well as increased professional services 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we incur additional costs related to the growth of our business 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel responsible for development of features and functionality for our service  as well as costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stage of computer software developed for internal use 
product development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was a result of increased staffing and associated costs relating to enhancing features and functionality to our web site and search service 
the increase was offset by the capitalization of software under statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use of approximately million  which we began amortizing in the third quarter of we believe our continued investment in product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect product development expenses to continue to increase in the future 
amortization of deferred compensation 
certain stock options granted from the inception of goto through our initial public offering have been considered to be compensatory for financial accounting purposes 
total compensation resulting from these stock options amounted to approximately million 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of the grants or issuances  adjusted for the return of unvested options or the repurchase of restricted stock resulting from employee terminations 
compensation associated with these stock options is amortized and expensed over the applicable vesting periods using a graded methodology 
approximately million and million were amortized and charged to operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of and in accordance with sfas  management identified certain conditions as indicators of asset impairment on the net assets from the acquisitions of cadabra and auctionrover 
these indicators included the significant decline in the valuations of public companies operating in the internet space 
management s re evaluation of its strategies and fit for these business lines 
a significant decrease in the stock price of goto compared to the purchase price of these acquisitions 
management s decision to decrease its investment in these business lines 
in accordance with sfas  an impairment loss should be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
the estimate of fair value shall consider selling prices or fair values for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques eg  discounted cash flows as well as other strategic and market factors to the extent available in the circumstances 
management has estimated the fair value of the net assets acquired  based on discounted future cash flows as well as strategic and market factors  to be below the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets 
accordingly  goto took a charge to operations during the fourth quarter of for approximately million  to write down these assets 
an additional factor considered by management was the difficulty in estimating future cash flows for the comparison shopping business line and the internet auctions business line because they are still in their infancy 
it is possible that the ultimate realizability of the assets of these business lines could differ from these estimates in the near term 
currently goto intends to exit the comparison shopping business and accordingly goto is evaluating strategic alternatives 
goto is also currently evaluating strategic alternatives for goto tm auctions  including an equity partner or the possibility of a sale of this portion of our business 
interest income 
interest income consists primarily of earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  net of interest expense attributable to leased equipment and debt 
interest income  net was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to goto s holding the initial public offering proceeds for the entire year of versus partial year in  together with the million settlement paid by the walt disney company to goto in settlement of trademark litigation  offset by the declining balance of cash and investments 
other income

total compensation resulting from these stock options amounted to approximately million

interest income  net was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased earnings on cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments in available for sale securities  which increased as a result of our initial public offering and series d preferred stock issuance 
other income 
other income of approximately  for the year ended december  was primarily due from a non recurring transaction  in which we received a payment from an affiliate in settlement for the early termination of a distribution agreement 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to the rapid growth and increased size and scope of operations 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately million and net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change resulted from purchases of short term and long term investments in  which were sold in  and additional capital expenditures for properties and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to the issuance of common stock through our initial public offering and the issuance of preferred stock in on january   goto acquired cadabra  an online comparison shopping service  which provides consumers the ability to locate their desired products by automating product comparison across multiple attributes 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization  goto acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and assumed all outstanding options to acquire shares of capital stock of cadabra  for million in cash and  shares of goto common stock 
on may   goto acquired auctionrover  an online resource for auctions 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization  goto acquired all the outstanding shares of capital stock and assumed all outstanding options to acquire shares of capital stock of auctionrover for  shares of goto common stock 
on october   goto acquired substantially all of the assets of searchup  inc  which did not have significant business operations 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  goto searchup s operational web site  registered urls  trademarks and patent on its url position manager for  shares of goto common stock 
our principal sources of liquidity consisted of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million as of december  and approximately million as of december  we believe that our cash and liquid investment reserves are sufficient to sustain operations through the next months  however  unknown factors may require us to seek additional capital 
such unknown factors may include  among other things  competitive pressure  higher cost of intellectual capital  higher costs to accommodate increases in capacity and acquisitions 
we are obligated to make guaranteed payments totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  under contracts to provide search services to its affiliates we may seek additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity depending upon the results of operations  market conditions or unforeseen opportunities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors 
the pace of expansion of our operations will affect our capital requirements 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially as a result of the factors described above 
if we require additional capital resources  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a bank line of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
risks that could affect our financial condition and results of operations we have a limited operating history 
goto was founded in september  officially launched its service in june  and has a limited operating history 
an investor in our common stock must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
these risks include our complete dependence on online advertising and consumer search services with only limited market acceptance  need to develop and upgrade our infrastructure  including internal controls  transaction processing systems  data storage and retrieval systems and web site  need to manage changing operations  dependence upon and need to hire and retain key personnel  and ability to integrate acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that the goto service will retain its existing  or attract new  advertisers  consumers and affiliates  which are web sites that include goto s services on their sites or that direct consumer traffic to the goto web site 
we also cannot assure you that goto will achieve significant additional revenues or improve operating margins in future periods 
there can be no assurance that goto s services will continue to achieve commercial success and  if they do not  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of losses and expect future losses 
we have not achieved profitability 
we expect to be profitable during the fourth quarter of  but we may never become profitable should adverse events occur 
we incurred a net loss of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
although our revenue has grown in recent quarters  we cannot be certain that this growth will continue 
we expect to continue to increase our marketing  sales and service  product development and general and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability and in the absence of significant additional revenue  we may need to raise additional funds 
if we do achieve profitability  we cannot be certain that we will sustain or increase it 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations because of many factors  and any of these could adversely affect our stock price 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and  as a result of these or other factors  the price of our common stock may fall or significantly fluctuate 
our operating results have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including demand for our services by advertisers and consumers  including the number of searches performed by consumers and the rate at which they click through to paid search results  prices paid by advertisers using the goto services  which are not determined by goto  our costs of attracting consumers to goto s services  including costs of receiving exposure on third party web sites and advertising costs  costs related to agreements with suppliers of consumer traffic to our service and professional services  loss of our agreements with suppliers of consumer traffic  the mix of paying vs 
non paying results on the goto services  our ability to significantly increase our distribution channels  seasonality  typical of our industry  which in the past has been lower in the first and third quarters of our fiscal year  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our operations  costs and delays in introducing new goto services and improvements to existing services  costs related to the integration of acquisitions  changes in the growth rate of internet usage and acceptance by consumers of e commerce  technical difficulties  system failures or internet downtime  government regulations related to the internet  our ability to upgrade and develop our information technology systems and infrastructure  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  and general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the internet and related industries 
as a result of our limited operating history  it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue  and we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses 
we plan to significantly increase our operating expenses to expand our marketing and sales operations  broaden our customer support capabilities and fund greater levels of product development 
we base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and estimates of future revenue  and our expenses are relatively fixed 
revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend upon the volume of the searches conducted on our service  the amounts bid by advertisers for keyword search listings on the service and the number of advertisers that bid on the service  none of which are under our control 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we also may be unable to increase our spending and expand our operations in a timely manner to adequately meet user demand to the extent it exceeds our expectations 
we depend on a limited number of sources to direct consumers to our service to conduct searches 
the consumers who conduct searches on our service come from a limited number of sources 
our sources for consumers conducting searches are members of our affiliate network  including portals  such as aol  terra lycos and altavista  providers of internet browsers such as netscape communicator and microsoft internet explorer  aggregators of search offerings of various providers  internet service providers  such as earthlink  and our web site 
in august  we entered into a month distribution agreement under which aol will display goto s listings on the search results page of aol  aol 
com and netscape s netcenter 
we also recently entered into a one year extension to an existing agreement with microsoft corporation for continued traffic from their internet explorer and internet explorer browsers 
this source delivered a diminishing level of traffic to us in compared to  and we expect that we will eventually receive no traffic from this source 
in addition  our agreement with netscape will expire on june  although sources of consumer traffic to our service fluctuate  in any given month we typically depend upon one or a few of these sources for a significant majority of traffic and searches conducted on our service 
for the quarter ended december   approximately of all of goto s traffic came from our affiliates 
of goto s total traffic  approximately of the total traffic came from portals  aol  terra lycos and altavista  approximately of the total traffic came from the browsers  microsoft s internet explorer and netscape  approximately of the total traffic came from other affiliates  and the remaining of the total traffic came directly to the goto web site 
goto s agreements with affiliates vary in duration and terms 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing any of these agreements or entering into new distribution agreements on commercially acceptable terms 
our success depends upon achieving a large and active base of advertisers and consumers 
our ability to increase the volume of transactions on our service and the amounts bid by our advertisers is dependent upon achieving market acceptance from more advertisers and consumers using our services 
most potential advertisers have only limited experience advertising on the internet and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to internet advertising 
advertising through priority placement on our services in particular has been introduced only recently  and we cannot predict the level of its acceptance as an advertising medium 
our services may not achieve significant acceptance by consumers 
among other things  because our services prioritize search results based on advertising bids associated with keywords rather than on algorithmic or other traditional search and retrieval technologies  consumers may perceive our results to be less objective than those provided by traditional search methods 
failure to achieve and maintain a large and active base of advertisers and consumers could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success is dependent upon further developing and enhancing the affiliate network 
we believe that our future success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to further develop and maintain relationships with affiliates  who provide their users with goto services on their sites or direct their traffic to our web site 
we believe these relationships are important in order to facilitate broad market acceptance of our services and enhance our sales 
our future ability to attract consumers to our services is dependent upon the growth of our affiliate network  which is new and unproven 
our agreements with some of our affiliates are generally terminable at will by either party at any time 
the loss of our agreements with our existing affiliates could damage our business 
if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with affiliates  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or will not be extremely volatile 
the price of our common stock may decline or may be extremely volatile 
since our initial public offering in june  the per share closing price of our common stock has ranged from a high of as of november  to a low of as of december  in addition  an active public market for goto s common stock may not continue 
our industry is highly competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively 
goto competes with online services  other web sites and advertising networks such as doubleclick inc and media  inc  as well as traditional offline media such as television  radio and print for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
we believe that the number of companies selling web based advertising and the available inventory of advertising space has recently substantially increased 
accordingly  goto may face increased pricing pressure for the sale of advertisements and direct marketing opportunities  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
goto also competes with providers of web directories  search  shopping  auction and information services  all of whom offer services competitive with goto  including  among others  altavista  amazon 
com  inc  ask jeeves  inc  cnet  inc including mysimon inc  dealtime 
com  ebay  excite home  inc 
including webcrawler and magellan  google  inc  inktomi corporation  looksmart  ltd  microsoft corporation linkexchange  inc and msn 
com  nbci  terra lycos  inc including hotbot and yahoo inc 
in addition  primedia  which owns about 
com  offers a product called sprinks  which is a pay per click advertising service  and there are other companies that offer directly competing services as well 
many of these competitors  as well as potential entrants into our market  have longer operating histories  larger customer or user bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these current and potential competitors can devote substantially greater resources to promotion and web site and systems development than we can 
in addition  as the use of the internet and other online services increases  larger  well established and well financed entities may continue to acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with providers of web directories  search  shopping  auction and information services or advertising solutions  and existing providers of web directories  search  shopping  auction and information services or advertising solutions may continue to consolidate 
in addition  providers of internet browsers and other internet products and services who are affiliated with providers of web directories and information services in competition with the goto service may more tightly integrate these affiliated offerings into their browsers or other products or services 
any of these trends would increase the competition we face and could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon maintaining and expanding our computer and communications systems 
our failure to achieve or maintain high capacity data transmission without system downtime and achieve improvements to our transaction processing systems and network infrastructure would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we believe that our current transaction processing systems and network infrastructure are insufficient to support our future growth 
although we are enhancing and expanding our transaction processing systems and network infrastructure  we have experienced occasional systems interruptions and infrastructure failures  which we believe will continue to occur 
we must maintain and continue to upgrade our new financial and accounting systems 
if we are not able to maintain or continue to automate our sales  financial and accounting systems and processes  and upgrade those systems in accordance with our growth  including the integration of any acquired companies systems and data  we may not have adequate  accurate or timely financial information 
failure to have adequate  accurate or timely financial information would harm our business and could lead to volatility in our stock price 
if we grow rapidly  we will face additional challenges in upgrading and maintaining these systems 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a limited number of advertisers 
if our major advertisers were to substantially cut back advertising or stop using our services  our business would be seriously harmed 
a majority of our total revenue is derived from a small proportion of our advertisers 
we believe that a substantial amount of revenue from advertising sales in any given future period may come from a relatively small number of advertisers 
we do not have formal contractual relationships with many of our advertisers and when we do have contracts all are terminable at any time by the advertiser 
as a result  we cannot assure you that any of our advertisers will purchase advertising from us in the future 
continued adoption of the internet as a method of conducting business is necessary for our future growth 
the failure of the internet to continue to develop as a commercial and business medium would adversely affect our business 
the widespread acceptance and adoption of the internet by traditional businesses for conducting business and exchanging information is likely only if the internet provides these businesses with greater efficiencies and improvements 
failure to expand internet infrastructure could limit our future growth 
the growth in internet traffic has caused frequent periods of decreased performance  and if internet usage continues to grow rapidly  the internet s infrastructure may not be able to support these demands and its performance and reliability may decline 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our services depend upon improvements being made to the entire internet as well as to our individual advertisers and consumers networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion 
increased security risks of online commerce may deter future use of our services 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of consumers may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  and online commerce in particular 
our failure to prevent security breaches could significantly harm our business and results of operations 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  cause interruptions in our operations or damage our brand and reputation 
we do not believe that our data repositories  financial systems and other technology resources are secure from security breaches or sabotage and we occasionally experience attempts at hacking or security breaches 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information or downloading sensitive materials  which would adversely affect the business of our advertisers and  accordingly  our business 
we face the risks of system failures 
we currently do not have a disaster recovery plan in effect and do not have fully redundant systems for our services at an alternate site 
a disaster such as fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  break in  sabotage or a similar event could severely damage our business and results of operations because our services could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  which are located in pasadena  california and at five offsite locations 
these offsite locations are managed by third parties 
they are managed by globalcenter  in sunnyvale  california qwest communications international  inc  in burbank  california cable and wireless usa  inc  in reston  virginia esat net  in dublin  ireland colo 
com  in las vegas  nevada expected opening in second quarter of pasadena  sunnyvale and burbank exist on or near known earthquake fault zones 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or unanticipated problems at our principal headquarters or at a third party facility could cause minor interruptions or delays in our business  limited loss of data or render us unable to provide some services 
in addition  failure by the third party facility to provide the data communications capacity required by us  as a result of human error  natural disaster or other operational disruptions  could cause interruptions in our service 
the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our reputation  brand and business  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california s current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
our computer systems are supplied primary power by the local power company 
in addition  the systems are connected to battery backup and diesel generators 
these alternative sources of power are provided by our hosting provider and are subject to their upkeep and maintenance 
our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages our customers or we may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our third party power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our affected facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation and could result in lost revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have experienced significant growth in our business  and any failure to manage this growth could damage our business 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have increased  and plan to continue to increase  the scope of our operations 
these expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on management  and  if we do not manage growth properly  it could adversely affect our business 
we will need to expand our infrastructure  which will include hiring certain key employees and continuing to increase our headcount 
hiring key employees  in particular  has historically been difficult  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
we may be unable to execute our business model in international markets 
one component of our strategy is to expand our operations into selected international markets 
for example  we launched our service in the united kingdom in november our strategy is to align with partners that will accelerate the timing of expansion  provide key distribution channels for our products and provide additional financing 
at this stage  the structure of potential partnerships is not known  but it is intended that the partners will take an equity position in our european entity  which may reduce the start up losses that goto would incur 
if appropriate partnerships with terms acceptable to us are not obtained  our share of international start up costs may be higher 
to date  we have only operated internationally in the united kingdom  and we may be unable to execute our business model in this market or new markets 
further  foreign providers of competing online services may have a substantial advantage over us in attracting users in their country due to more established branding in that country  greater knowledge with respect to the cultural differences of users residing in that country and or their focus on a single market 
we expect to continue to experience higher costs as a percentage of revenues in connection with the development and maintenance of international online services 
international markets we have selected may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment 
in particular  international markets typically have been slower than domestic markets in adopting the internet as an advertising and commerce medium 
in pursuing our international expansion strategy  we face several additional risks  including lower per capita internet usage in many countries abroad  due to a variety of causes such as lower disposable incomes  lack of telecommunications and computer infrastructure and questions regarding adequate online security for e commerce transactions  relatively small internet markets in some countries  which may prevent us from aggregating sufficient traffic and advertising revenues and scaling our business model in those countries  our potential inability to aggregate a large amount of internet traffic and find and develop relationships with international advertising and distribution partners  competition in international markets from a broad range of competitors  including yahoo  looksmart  altavista and other united states and foreign search engines  content aggregators and portals  some of which have greater local experience than we do  difficulties in recruiting qualified and knowledgeable staff and in building locally relevant products and services  which could prevent us from aggregating a large advertiser base  higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  trade barriers and unexpected changes and differences in regulatory  tax and legal requirements applicable to internet services  and longer payment cycles and foreign currency fluctuations 
one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  marketing  sales and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lost the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud 
we have suffered losses and may continue to suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data  even though the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders 
under current credit card practices  a merchant is liable for fraudulent credit card transactions when  as is the case with the transactions we process  that merchant does not obtain a cardholder s signature 
a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
many of our advertisers are emerging internet companies that represent credit risks 
some of our advertisers have limited operating histories  are operating at a loss  have limited cash reserves or have limited access to capital 
if any significant part of our customer base experiences financial difficulties  is not commercially successful or is unable to pay our advertising fees for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement and other matters that could adversely affect our business 
our services operate in part by making internet services and content available to our users 
this creates the potential for claims to be made against us  either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with third parties 
these claims might  for example  be made for defamation  negligence  copyright  trademark or patent infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or other legal theories 
allegations are made against us from time to time concerning these types of claims 
any claims could result in costly litigation and be time consuming to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
there can be no assurance that our services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on november  goto was served with a summons and complaint by mercexchange inc  alleging patent infringement relating to goto s online auction and shopping services 
the action is pending in the us district court in the eastern district of virginia 
goto is currently investigating the merits of this claim 
we may not be able to protect our internet domain name or intellectual property rights upon which our business relies 
our success and ability to compete also are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and data resources  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we have no patents issued to date on our technology 
there can be no assurance that we will adequately be able to protect our technology and data resources 
we are aware that certain other companies are using or may have plans to use the terms goto  go  go and variations of these terms as part of a company name  domain name  trademark or service mark 
in addition  we have received notice from companies claiming superior rights to marks such as these 
in particular  go systems  inc has recently threatened to file a claim against goto for violating its trademark rights 
goto denies that it is violating go systems rights 
in the event a lawsuit is filed  goto will contest the claim vigorously 
we cannot assure you that additional companies will not claim such superior rights or that we will not be subject to infringement claims 
a successful infringement claim by the owner of a mark including goto  go  go or a variation could require us to change our name or our logo  which would be expensive and disruptive to our business  and could result in damages 
further  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services  technology and other intellectual property  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and advertisers 
on october   goto announced its intent to change its corporate name and expects to make such a change within if the new name has a url that belongs to a third party  that url or other rights may be difficult to acquire and may delay our planned name change 
there are also certain costs associated with the planned name change  which may increase depending on  among other things  the availability of the url and other rights belonging to third parties 
we may need additional capital  which could dilute the ownership interest of investors 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or convertible debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
since our inception  we have experienced negative cash flow from operations and expect to experience significant negative cash flow from operations in the future 
we currently anticipate that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditure through at least the next months 
however  we may choose to raise additional funds prior to the expiration of this period or at a later date 
we may not find a strategic alternative for goto tm shopping 
we may not find a suitable exit strategy for the shopping business 
if we are unable to find an acceptable strategic alternative  we will cease operations of this product line 
if we were to terminate this product line we would incur additional costs such as severance charges 
we may not find a strategic alternative for goto tm auctions 
we may not find a suitable exit strategy for the auctions business 
if we are unable to find an acceptable equity partner  we may cease operations of this product line 
any delays in finding a suitable exit strategy could adversely affect our operating results 
other potential acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we may make investments in or acquire complementary products  technologies and businesses 
these acquisitions and investments could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
if we acquire a company  we could face difficulties in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
acquisitions of additional services or technologies also involve risks of incompatibility and the need for integration into our existing services and marketing  sales and support efforts 
if we finance the acquisitions by issuing equity securities  this could dilute our existing stockholders 
any amortization of goodwill or other assets  or other charges resulting from the costs of these acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results 
we may lose public recognition from our name change 
in october  we announced our intent to change our corporate name and expect to officially change our name by the middle of the possible loss of public recognition with our advertisers  consumers  affiliates and investors could adversely affect our operating results and our stock price 
our market may undergo rapid technological change and our future success will depend on our ability to meet the changing needs of our industry 
if new industry standards and practices emerge in the internet and online advertising industry  our existing services  technology and systems may become obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to license and internally develop leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing services  develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective consumers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
government regulation and legal uncertainties may damage our business 
the laws and regulations applicable to the internet and our services are evolving and unclear and could damage our business 
there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to  or commerce on  the internet 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted  covering issues such as user privacy  defamation  database protection  pricing  taxation  content regulation  quality of products and services  and intellectual property ownership and infringement 
such legislation could expose goto to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the internet  decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  or require goto to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations 
we may incur liabilities for the activities of users of our service 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled and could damage our business 
we do not carry insurance that will indemnify us for liability for activities of our users 
we cannot assure you that goto will successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users of our service 
the imposition upon goto of potential liability for unlawful activities of users of our service could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require us  among other things  to spend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of such liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have broad discretion to use our capital and how we invest these proceeds may not yield a favorable return 
our management can spend our capital in ways with which the stockholders may not agree 
future sales of our common stock by our stockholders may depress our stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
up to approximately million shares of common stock outstanding at december  may be available for sale in the public market  except for million shares that are subject to repurchase by goto and transfer restrictions as a result of vesting agreements 
our charter documents and change of control severance agreements with our management will make it more difficult to acquire us 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes  with one class being elected each year by our stockholders  which generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of directors and obtain control of our board 
in addition  stockholder meetings may be called only by our board of directors  the chairman of the board and the president  advanced notice is required prior to stockholder proposals  and stockholders may not act by written consent 
further  we have authorized preferred stock that is undesignated  making it possible for the board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of goto 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
specifically  section of the delaware general corporation law may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our stockholders 
we have entered into change of control severance agreements with members of our senior management providing for certain benefits  including acceleration of option vesting  to these members if they are terminated other than for cause following an acquisition of goto 
these agreements could make us less attractive to a third party who may want to acquire us because they will make any replacement of management more expensive 
furthermore  in march  we entered into a stockholder agreement with bill gross idealab  which limits bill gross idealab s and its affiliates ability to beneficially own or more of our outstanding common stock  to transfer shares of our common stock or to knowingly assist or advise  or knowingly provide or arrange financing to facilitate any other person or entity to beneficially own or more of our outstanding common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk goto is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations goto s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to goto s investment portfolio 
goto has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
goto invests its excess cash in high quality credit instruments  which are spread over many issuers 
goto s investments are principally confined to cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities 
international revenues from goto s foreign subsidiaries were less than of total revenues in international sales are made from goto s united kingdom operations and are denominated in the local currency 
this subsidiary and our other foreign subsidiary in ireland also incur most of its expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
goto s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  goto s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
goto s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to goto s foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
goto is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on goto in was not material
