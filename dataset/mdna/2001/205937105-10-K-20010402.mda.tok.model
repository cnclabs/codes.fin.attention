the results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
certain statements in this discussion and analysis  including statements regarding our strategy  financial performance and revenue sources  are forward looking statements based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements  including those described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global supplier of system solutions for the broadband access market 
our products enable domestic and international cable operators to provide high speed  cost effective internet access  reduce operating costs  and maximize revenue opportunities in a variety of subscriber markets including residential  corporate telecommuters  and small businesses 
we develop  manufacture and sell headend equipment  subscriber cable modems  and network management software  all designed to support asynchronous transfer mode atm  data over cable system interface specification docsis  euro docsis and digital video broadcasting dvb industry standards 
in the north american market  we primarily sell directly to cable operators and systems integrators 
internationally  we sell primarily to systems integrators  who in turn sell to cable operators 
during the first half of  cable modem manufacturers experienced shortages and long lead times with respect to certain components such as flash memory and capacitors 
due to these shortages  the production of cable modems was constrained 
com placed substantial orders for component material to ensure we would meet our anticipated build plan  especially for our doxport modem that we commenced shipping late in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the order rates and corresponding revenues dropped sharply resulting from lower demand from cable operators 
this slow down in sales in the fourth quarter of caused our inventory levels to increase substantially 
in addition  cable operators began to lengthen their accounts payable payments cycles as they more tightly managed their working capital 
although we believe that deployment of cable modems will continue to increase as subscriber growth for high speed access is forecasted to increase in  some cable operators have delayed ordering new equipment in early in order to utilize the existing levels of inventory 
due to this oversupply of inventory by manufacturers  price competition has become more intense which has resulted in lower average selling prices and gross margin pressures 
we expect the slow down in procurement by cable operators to continue at least through the first half of on a forward looking basis we believe these factors are likely to depress revenues  and are likely to cause inventory levels to remain higher than historical levels due to lower shipment rates 
we anticipate that accounts receivable balance will remain at a relatively high level compared to historical levels as cable operators manage working capital tightly 
with the slow down in shipments our contract manufactures have begun charging us for the carrying cost of inventory 
recent developments in january  we announced a number of programs to reduce our operating expenses 
these included the termination of a project to develop a dvb headend  the focusing of our engineering efforts on fewer projects and the elimination of certain marketing programs 
this resulted in a reduction in personnel in these areas along with some administrative and support functions 
we also transferred certain engineering and marketing efforts to lower cost development centers in ireland and maryland 
in addition we announced that we had engaged a placement agent to help us spin out our wireless group into a separate minority owned subsidiary that would be separately funded 
furthermore  we were engaged in working with a european company on a joint venture development contract 
finally  we announced that we have engaged dain rauscher wessels to assist us to evaluate working capital alternatives 
in the future  we may continue to reduce operating expenses to accommodate decreased revenues or gross margins  or discontinue some development programs and product lines 
this could result in the reductions in work force  restructuring charges  write downs of inventory carrying values or provisions for the impairment of long lived assets 
any of these factors could affect our financial results of operations or stock price 
as described below  we made two acquisitions in to secure needed product development resources and expertise particularly in cable telephony products 
as market dynamics change  resources become available locally  our ability to retain resources improves  and other product relationships with third parties evolve  we will continue to evaluate our ownership position 
we may determine that the most cost effective means to secure these resources is a different relationship 
this could result in accelerated amortization charges for intangible assets or provisions for the impairment of long lived assets in future periods 
on march   the company entered into a definitive agreement to complete a million private equity financing 
pursuant to a subscription agreement  dated february   the company sold  shares of unregistered common stock at a price of per share and a warrant to acquire up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the offer and sale of these shares were not registered under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to the exemption provided by regulation d and these securities may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements 
the warrant is immediately exercisable and remains exercisable for a period of seven years from the date of issuance 
acquisitions gadline on july   pursuant to a share purchase agreement the gadline agreement dated april  by com and gadline  ltd 
gadline  an israeli company  gadline was merged with and into com gadline develops  manufactures and markets fully managed networking solutions that deliver high speed data and telephony services over a hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure 
pursuant to the gadline agreement  the shareholders of gadline received an aggregate of  shares of com common stock and all outstanding gadline options converted into options to purchase  shares of com common stock 
on january   gadline met certain milestones defined in the gadline agreement which resulted in the issuance of an additional  shares of com common stock valued on the measurement date at  this amount will be added to goodwill in the first quarter of and be amortized over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset 
an additional  shares of com common stock may be issued to gadline shareholders upon completion of predefined milestones 
the fair value of the contingent shares will be measured upon achievement of the predefined milestones and will also be accounted for as additional purchase price 
we also assumed certain operating assets and liabilities of gadline 
the acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
the total purchase price as of july  was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as follows in thousands total purchase price common stock issued stock options assumed acquisition expenses purchase price allocation fair market value of net tangible assets acquired at july  intangible assets acquired economic life customer base workforce in place tradename core technology current technology in process research development goodwill we recorded a one time charge of million in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for for purchased in process technology related to a development project that had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use  and for which successful development was uncertain 
the in process development project is an integrated network solution for data and voice over internet protocol 
at the time of acquisition  estimated costs to complete the development were million 
management expects that product being developed will become available for sale in fiscal  however  we can not assure that these products will become available by that time 
to date  we have incurred expenses on the project of million 
failure to reach successful completion of this project could result in impairment of the associated capitalized intangible assets and could require the company to accelerate the time period over which the intangibles are being amortized  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
we utilized assumptions to determine the value of in process technology included several factors  including the following 
first  an income approach that focuses on the income producing capability of the acquired technology  and best represents the present value of the future economic benefits which we expected to derive from them 
second  we forecast net cash flows that we expected might result from the development effort  using projections prepared by com s management 
third  a discount rate of was computed after analysis of the risk of an investment in gadline which considered the implied rate of the transaction and the weighted average cost of capital 
bitcom  inc on july   pursuant to a share purchase agreement the bitcom agreement dated june  by com and bitcom  inc bitcom  a delaware company with facilities in maryland  bitcom was merged with and into com bitcom is an engineering consulting and development company specializing in the fields of wired and wireless telecommunications  satellite  and networking engineering 
pursuant to the bitcom agreement  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of bitcom for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
additionally  the company assumed  options to purchase bitcom stock 
on january   certain milestones defined in the bitcom agreement were met resulting in the issuance of an additional  shares of com common stock valued on the measurement date at  this amount will be recorded as stock compensation in the first quarter of the company also assumed certain operating assets and liabilities of bitcom 
the acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
the total purchase price as of july  was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as follows in thousands total purchase price cash stock options assumed acquisition expenses purchase price allocation fair market value of net tangible assets acquired of bitcom at july  intangible assets acquired economic life workforce in place goodwill deferred tax liabilities in connection with the bitcom acquisition  the company granted  shares of restricted common stock to former bitcom employees who have executed employment agreements with com the shares are released from restriction  in proportionate amounts  at each of the three anniversary dates of the acquisition 
if an employee terminates prior to vesting  that employee s restricted shares are subject to forfeiture 
as of december   all shares remained restricted 
the company recorded a deferred compensation charge of  as a separate component of stockholders equity  for the fair value of the common shares on the issuance date and will amortize the amount  net of forfeitures  over the three year vesting period 
for the year ended december    of compensation expense related to these awards was recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
results of operations years ended december    and total revenues 
total revenues in increased by to million as compared to million in our revenue growth was principally due to growth in cable modem and headend revenues over the prior year 
unit sales of all our cable modem products increased from  as we experienced strong demand for our atm and docsis cable modems 
revenues associated with our headend products increased as we experienced continued strong demand for these products especially in europe 
cable modem sales accounted for of total revenue in as compared to of total revenues in although we experienced growth in revenues  com did experience a sharp decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to prior quarters due to an industry wide downturn in broadband equipment purchases as cable operators balanced inventories 
the average sales price of all cable modems declined during our prices decreased due to planned price reductions to meet pricing pressures from competitors and due to the increased acceptance of our lower priced docsis products 
we anticipate that the average sales price of modems will continue to decline during due to competitive price pressures and the number of suppliers competing for market share 
total revenues increased by to million in as compared to million in our revenue growth was principally due to the growth in cable modem revenue over the prior year 
cable modem sales accounted for of total revenue in as compared to of total revenue in the average sales price of our cable modems declined during  as expected 
our prices decreased primarily due to increased price competition 
the average sales price of our headend equipment increased moderately during primarily due to the mix of product sold 
gross margins 
gross margins decreased to in from in the decrease in margins is due primarily to the rapid acceptance of the docsis cable modems especially in north america 
docsis cable modem shipments increased from  units or of total com modem shipments in to  units or of total com modems shipped in the adoption of the docsis based standard has caused considerable price pressure due to the number of competitors in the marketplace 
during we anticipate continued pressure on margins due to the following increased sales of our docsis cable modems 
as these lower margin modems continue to become a higher percentage of our total revenues  we anticipate our total margin percentage will decline 
competitive pricing offered by an increasing number of cable modem suppliers entering the market 
as the industry continues to move toward standardization of technology we anticipate increased pricing pressure 
gross margins decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin in was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of cable modems as a percentage of total product sales and a shift away from our higher margin software products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase in is primarily due to higher consulting expenses  increases in personnel related expenses in our cork  ireland development center  and a million impairment charge related to a development project  and the addition of engineering headcount from our acquisitions of gadline and bitcom 
in addition  million was incurred in due to the amortization of intangibles associated with these acquisitions 
in  we anticipate that actual dollar amount of research and development expenses will decline from the level 
this decline will be due to a reduced number of personnel and the elimination of certain development programs as we refocus our development efforts on key technology initiatives 
com recorded a one time charge of million in the third quarter of for purchased in process technology related to a development project that had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use  and for which successful development was uncertain in connection with the acquisition of gadline 
there were no acquisition related charges in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased consulting and personnel related expenses related to product development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to higher costs associated with increased personnel in the sales  marketing  and service organizations 
we increased sales personnel internationally strengthening our sales presence in asia and latin america 
we also increased our customer service personnel to support the growth of our installed base of equipment and help manage our growing number of customers 
marketing headcount and expenses increased due to the acquisition of gadline in israel  additional marketing and advertising investments related to the introduction of new products  and general corporate branding projects 
in  we anticipate that actual dollar amount of marketing expenses will decline from the level 
this decline will be due to personnel reductions and a decrease in expenditures on marketing programs in connection with our effort to reduce operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to higher costs associated with increased personnel in sales and marketing organizations 
we increased sales personnel internationally strengthening our sales presence in europe  asia and latin america  as well as domestically 
we also increased our customer service personnel to support the growth of our installed base of equipment and help manage our growing number of customers 
we added personnel to our marketing department as we expanded our marketing programs both domestically and internationally 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the addition of new personnel in milpitas  the addition of administration headcount from our acquisition of gadline  and investments in infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses included acquisition related charges of million related to the amortization of goodwill  intangibles and deferred stock compensation 
in  we anticipate that actual dollar amount of general and administrative expense will decline from the level 
this decline will be due to personnel reductions and general decrease in expenses in connection with our effort to reduce operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily attributable to increased personnel in our finance and administrative organization 
this was offset by a decline in our legal fees associated with patent litigation  which was settled in january total other income  net 
total other income  net decreased to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower interest income on a declining cash and investments balance during coupled with  in foreign exchange losses 
total other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to earnings on higher average cash and investment balances during resulting from the net cash received of million from the initial public offering of common stock in may and the net cash received of million from the secondary offering of common stock in february income taxes 
income tax expense for all years consisted solely of state franchise taxes 
we have not recorded any other income tax expense or benefit as we have not generated taxable income and as we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on our evaluation of the likelihood of realization of future tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million of which million is restricted for use under two stand by letters of credit 
of the restricted million  million was issued to our primary contract manufacturer  celestica  in response to increased inventory levels and a reduction to our manufacturing build plan 
the remaining million was issued to a sole source component vendor 
net cash used in operating activities was million in cash used in operating activities primarily resulted from outflows due to a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the decline in market conditions in the second half of which caused several major customers to delay payments  and an increase in inventory of million which is a direct result of lower shipments in the fourth quarter of due to the slower procurement of equipment by customers 
the cash outflows were offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  and noncash activities including stock compensation of million  in process research and development of million and a million asset impairment charge 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of million offset by purchases property and equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million 
cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of debt obligations of million and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
we used million to support stand by letters of credit 
on march   the company entered into a definitive agreement to complete a million private equity financing 
pursuant to a subscription agreement  dated february   the company sold  shares of unregistered common stock at a price of per share and a warrant to acquire up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the warrant is immediately exercisable and remains exercisable for a period of seven years from the date of issuance 
during and we generated net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
we may also incur net losses during future periods 
due to a decline in our sales in the fourth quarter  we introduced measures to reduce operating expenses that included reductions in our workforce in december  and february  management continues to monitor market conditions to assess the need to take further action if necessary 
any subsequent actions may result in additional work force reductions  restructuring charges  reductions in inventory carrying values  discontinuation of product lines  and provisions for impairment of long lived assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
we are currently evaluating several alternatives to improve liquidity and working capital as required 
these alternatives include the sale of additional stock  additional lines of credit  and the divestiture of certain business assets 
there can be no assurance  however  that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  when required 
if our financial resources are insufficient to fund our activities and repay our debts  additional funds will be required 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  significant dilution to existing stockholders will result given the current price of our stock 
if additional funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate one or more of our research and development or manufacturing programs 
accordingly  the inability to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and available borrowings under our credit facilities at december  coupled with the march equity financing and the cost reduction programs described under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations recent developments will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through december  new accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
the company will adopt sfas no 
effective january  management has concluded its analysis of the effects of adopting sfas no 
and the adoption will not have an impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin summarizes certain interpretations and practices followed by the division of corporation finance and the office of the chief accountant of the sec in administering the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the adoption of sab no 
in had no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
com maintains an investment portfolio of government and corporate debt obligations 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december  and  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
com is also subject to interest rate risk as of december   related to variable rate debt obligations totaling  the variable rates debt obligations are linked to the prime rate and the libor rate and any increases in such market interest rates will increase the repayment obligation 
if market rate were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the repayment obligation would increase by  com has fixed rate debt obligations of  and  at december  and  respectively  that have no interest rate risk 
the fixed rates on such obligations was in and ranged from to in  and mature on various dates through market price risk 
com is also exposed to market price risk on investment in marketable equity securities held as available for sale investments 
these investments are in publicly traded companies as well as private companies in the volatile high technology industry sector 
a adverse change in the equity price would result in an approximate  and  decrease in the fair value of the investment in the marketable equity security as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency risk 
to date  our international sales have been dominated solely in us dollars  and accordingly  we have not been exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to sales transactions 
however  the functional currency of our subsidiaries in the ireland and israel is the us dollar and as the local accounts are maintained in irish pounds and israeli new shekels  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with remeasurement to us dollars 
a hypothetical change of in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operation
