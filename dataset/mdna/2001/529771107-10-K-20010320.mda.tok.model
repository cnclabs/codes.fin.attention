item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview lexmark international  inc international  and together with its subsidiaries  the company or lexmark is a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing solutions  including laser and inkjet printers  associated supplies and services for offices and homes 
the company also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms for business users 
in addition lexmark develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products which include supplies for select international business machines corporation ibm branded printers  aftermarket supplies for original equipment manufacturer oem products  and typewriters and typewriter supplies that are sold under the ibm trademark 
in the past several years  the worldwide printer industry has seen growth in laser and inkjet printers as a result of the increasing penetration of personal computers into home and office markets 
during this period  the company s own product mix has evolved  with its laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies representing an increasing percentage of its sales volume and revenue  particularly as the increasing base of installed lexmark printers generates additional revenue from recurring sales of supplies for those printers primarily laser and inkjet cartridges 
lexmark believes that its total revenue will continue to grow due to overall market growth and increases in the company s market share in both the laser and inkjet printer categories 
management believes that this growth will more than offset reduced demand for dot matrix impact printers and declines in sales of ibm branded supplies as well as typewriters and typewriter supplies that are sold under the ibm trademark 
in recent years  the company s growth rate in sales of printer units has generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenue due to selling price reductions and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets 
in the laser printer market  unit price reductions are partially offset by the tendency of customers to add optional features including network adapters  additional memory and paper drawers as well as new scanner and fax options 
in the inkjet printer market  advances in color inkjet technology have resulted in printers with sharper resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices 
the greater affordability of color inkjet printers has been an important factor in the growth of this market 
as the installed base of lexmark laser and inkjet printers continues to grow  management expects the market for their associated supplies will grow as well  as such supplies are routinely required for use throughout the life of the printers 
the associated supplies are a relatively high margin  recurring business which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time 
the company s dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for ibm printers  typewriters and other impact supplies that require little ongoing investment 
the company expects that the market for these products will rapidly decline  and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products and pursue the aftermarket oem supplies opportunity  while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 
the company expects that its overall operating margins will remain relatively stable as the associated printer supplies become an increasing part of its business 
although the company expects continuing declines in printer prices  it expects to be able to reduce costs and expenses generally in line with price decreases 
restructuring and related charges in october  lexmark s management and board of directors approved a plan to restructure its worldwide operations 
the restructuring plan will involve relocating manufacturing  primarily laser printers  to mexico and china  and reductions in associated support infrastructure

a balance of million net of unamortized discount of million was outstanding at december  the company has an agreement in place to sell its us trade receivables on a limited recourse basis 
in october  the company amended that agreement and  the maximum amount of us trade receivables to be sold was increased from million to million 
as collections reduce previously sold receivables  the company may replenish these with new receivables 
at december   us trade receivables of million had been sold and  due to the revolving nature of the agreement  million also remained outstanding 
at december   us trade receivables of million had been sold and also remained outstanding 
the agreement  which contains customary financial covenants  must be renewed annually  and is expected to be renewed upon its expiration in october the risk the company bears from bad debt losses on us trade receivables sold is retained by the company since the company holds a retained interest in the sold receivables of approximately million

the capital expenditures during the past three years were primarily attributable to capacity expansion  the support of new products and research and development facilities 
looking forward to  the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million and will include further expansion of printer and associated supplies manufacturing capacity and new products 
the capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through cash from operations 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management revenue derived from international operations  including exports from the united states  made up more than half of the company s consolidated revenue  with european revenue accounting for about two thirds of international revenue 
substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
currency translation has significantly affected international revenue and cost of revenue  and although it did not have a material impact on operating income for the years and  the operating income was materially adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 
the company attempts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges  such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions 
the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges 
therefore  the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in us and european markets as a result  in part  of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
tax matters the company s effective income tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the income tax rate was primarily due to the effect of lower tax rates on manufacturing activities in certain countries 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to tax examinations in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations 
as of december   the company had non us tax loss carryforwards of million  including million which are not expected to provide a future benefit because they are attributable to certain non us entities that are also taxable in the us new accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
the company adopted sab as required by december  and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf  classification in the statement of cash flows of the income tax benefit realized by a company upon employee exercise of a nonqualified stock option 
this statement requires that cash flows realized from an income tax benefit as a result of employee stock option exercises be recorded in cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 
this statement is effective for quarters ending after july  with reclassification required for comparative cash flow statements 
the company adopted this statement in the third quarter of and has reclassified prior year amounts to conform with the classification of such items as cash flows from operating activities 
the company had previously recorded such items in cash flows from financing activities 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after march  sfas no 
also includes provisions that require additional disclosures in the financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  additional disclosures have been included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices and operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures 
as a result  future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
however  the company actively manages its product costs and manufacturing processes in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases 
year the company has not experienced any significant internal system difficulties associated with the year issue 
factors that may affect future results and information concerning forward looking statements statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are made based upon management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management  and there are a number of factors that could adversely affect the company s future operating results or cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements  including without limitation  the factors set forth below the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that meet customers needs 
the markets for laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies are increasingly competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the company and its major competitors  all of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their printers and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  both the inkjet and laser printer markets have experienced and are expected to continue to experience significant printer price pressure from the company s major competitors 
price reductions on inkjet or laser printer products or the inability to reduce costs  contain expenses or increase sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share  particularly at a time when the company is increasing its investment to support product introductions  expand capacity and enter new geographies 
delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and pricing programs  the reaction of competitors to any such new products or programs  the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  and variations in the cost of component parts  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses 
the company is beginning to rely more heavily on its international production facilities and international manufacturing partners for the manufacture of its products and key components of its products 
future operating results may be adversely affected by several factors  including  without limitation  if the company s international operations or manufacturing partners are unable to supply products reliably  if there are difficulties in transitioning such manufacturing activities from the company to its international operations or manufacturing partners  or if there arise production and supply constraints which result in additional costs to the company 
revenue derived from international sales make up over half of the company s revenue 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade protection measures  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
moreover  margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales  and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the us and european markets  in part  because of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
the company s performance depends in part upon its ability to increase printer and associated supplies manufacturing capacity on an international basis in line with growing market demands  to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and manage worldwide inventory levels to support the demand of its customers  and to address production and supply constraints  particularly delays in the supply of key components necessary for production  which may result in the company incurring additional costs to meet customer demand 
the company s future operating results and its ability to effectively grow or maintain its market share may be adversely affected if it is unable to address these issues on a timely basis 
the company markets and sells its products through several sales channels 
the company s future results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between or among its various sales channels 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise adversely affect its operating results  cash flows  financial position or business  as could expenses incurred by the company in enforcing its intellectual property rights against others or defending against claims that the company s products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
factors unrelated to the company s operating performance  including economic and business conditions  both national and international  the loss of significant customers  manufacturing partners or suppliers  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings  and the ability to retain and attract key personnel  could also adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  can be volatile 
trading activity in the company s common stock  particularly the trading of large blocks and interday trading in the company s common stock  may affect the company s common stock price 
while the company reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations in connection with the preparation of its quarterly and annual reports  the company does not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this report 
the information referred to above should be considered by investors when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this report  in any of the company s public filings or press releases or in any oral statements made by the company or any of its officers or other persons acting on its behalf 
the important factors that could affect forward looking statements are subject to change  and the company does not intend to update the foregoing list of certain important factors 
by means of this cautionary note  the company intends to avail itself of the safe harbor from liability with respect to forward looking statements that is provided by section a and section e referred to above 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitivity the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates at december   the fair value of the company s senior notes is estimated at million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements  taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt 
the carrying value exceeded the fair value of debt at december  by approximately million 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately million at december  foreign currency exchange rates the company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the company s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro  other european currencies  the japanese yen and other asian and south american currencies 
exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts  put options  and call options all with maturity dates of less than eighteen months 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately million 
this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures
