fiscal outlook the company expects that the events of september th and their aftermath coupled with the already soft economy will continue to influence its operating results into fiscal this impact is likely to be most significant in certain of the media networks operations and parks resorts 
the media networks advertising supported businesses  such as the television and radio network and stations  are expected to have declines in revenues due to the soft advertising marketplace  continued ratings decreases and a potential increase in news preemptions and higher news production costs 
in cable  the slow economy and a surplus of inventory are resulting in downward pressure on advertising rates 
parks resorts operations are likely to be affected by the downturn in leisure travel and lower consumer confidence especially as compared to the record setting first quarter the segment achieved in the prior year 
to date  walt disney world attendance is down roughly versus the first quarter of last year 
we expect hotel occupancy to be down by approximately and percentage points for walt disney world and disneyland  respectively  compared to the first quarter of last year 
additionally  the company expects that soft retail sales and weak consumer confidence are likely to affect its consumer products business 
as such  the company believes that its operating income in the first quarter of fiscal could be somewhat less than half that of the strong first quarter results of the prior year 
the company expects that the first quarter will represent the most difficult year over year comparison 
while the future is uncertain  the company should experience an improved business climate in the last three fiscal quarters of  with operating income declines of as much as to percent for those later three periods combined versus the prior year 
the company is taking a variety of measures to mitigate these impacts  including a planned reduction of fiscal capital expenditures 
in the parks resorts businesses  mitigation efforts include reducing man hours  closing non essential food and beverage locations  instituting a hiring freeze and delaying non essential refurbishments 
in media networks  all businesses are undertaking aggressive cost reduction initiatives

additionally  revenue declines at the television network reflected lower sports advertising revenues due to abc airing the super bowl in the prior year 
the increase at the cable networks was driven by annual contractual rate adjustments at espn combined with subscriber growth at espn  the disney channel domestically and internationally  partially offset by the soft advertising market during the year

the company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of broadcast rights for sports and other programming including the nfl  major league baseball mlb and the national hockey league nhl 
the costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years 
the company has implemented a variety of strategies  including marketing efforts  to reduce the impact of the higher costs 
the impact of these contracts on the company s results over the remaining term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences 
the costs of these contracts are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues over the remaining contract period 
estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly and  accordingly  they are reviewed periodically and amortization and carrying amounts are adjusted  if necessary 
such adjustments could have a material effect on results of operations in future periods

item a 
market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain of its investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company s portfolio of borrowings 
the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues 
the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  revenues 
the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities in the same principal currencies 
the principal currencies hedged are the european euro  british pound  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
in addition  we use various financial instruments to minimize the exposure to changes in fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange and qualifying equity sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates  currencies and equity prices a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate  foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year end and over each of the four quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during the year 
the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and qualifying equity investments 
the values of foreign exchange options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currencies  as exchange rates vary 
therefore  the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in currency values 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the company s financial instruments at september  and the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  is as follows unaudited  in millions interest currency equity rate sensitive sensitive sensitive financial financial financial combined instruments instruments instruments portfolio var as of september  average var during the year ended september  highest var during the year ended september  lowest var during the year ended september
