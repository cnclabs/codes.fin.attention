item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following information contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  and are subject to the safe harbor created by that act 
such forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements regarding the future availability and prices of raw materials  competition in the titanium industry  demand for the company s products  the historic cyclicality of the titanium and aerospace industries  uncertain defense spending  long term supply agreements  the ultimate determination of pending trade petitions  global economic conditions  the company s order backlog and the conversion of that backlog into revenue  labor relations  the long term impact of the current energy situation  and other statements contained herein that are not historical facts 
because such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these and other risk factors are set forth below in the outlook section  as well as in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec over the last months  copies of which are available from the sec or may be obtained upon request from the company 
overview historically  a majority of the us titanium industry s output has been used in aerospace applications 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the fluctuations in performance of companies engaged in the titanium industry 
over the past years  titanium mill products shipments registered a cyclical peak of million pounds in and a low of million pounds in in the last several years  commercial aerospace markets have shown a significant increase in demand with the aforementioned cyclical peak occurring in demand was reduced in and again in in  demand was modestly improved compared to demand from military aerospace markets in recent years has stabilized at reduced build rate levels 
in the period  most major commercial airlines reported stronger operating profits and  during this same period  aircraft manufacturers increased build rates 
according to the airline monitor  at december   the leading manufacturers of commercial aircraft  boeing company and airbus industrie  reported an aggregate of  aircraft under firm order and deliverable over the next five years 
the comparable backlog as of december  was  aircraft 
notably  the backlog for wide body aircraft  such as the airbus a  and a and the boeing and  which typically consume more titanium per aircraft than their narrow body counterparts  at december   was aircraft as compared to aircraft at december  included in the wide body backlog at december  were boeing aircraft  which consume significantly more titanium than any other commercial aircraft  representing a increase over the december  backlog of aircraft 
both boeing and airbus have indicated plans for increased production in to meet expected shipment rates of aircraft and aircraft  respectively 
the company estimates that total industry shipments of titanium mill products in increased to approximately million pounds  from million pounds in starting with the asian financial crisis  production difficulties at its manufacturing facilities and uncertain global economic conditions which affected the demand for commercial aircraft  boeing commercial airplane group made a number of announcements reducing its forecasted production rates on a number of aircraft models through boeing and airbus industrie  through direct purchases and their families of subcontractors  consume the majority of titanium mill products produced for aerospace needs 
these companies and their subcontractors exercise considerable purchasing power in the industry 
aerospace contractors have announced delivery delays and rescheduling resulting from the boeing announcements and  therefore  a need to adjust inventory requirements downward from peak levels 
based on currently available information  the company anticipates that the us titanium industry s total shipments will increase in from levels  although  the amount of increase cannot be accurately predicted 
if worldwide economic conditions cause commercial airlines to cancel or delay aircraft  titanium demand and pricing could come under further pressure 
in recent years  the company has devoted significant resources to developing new markets for titanium in the oil and gas and geothermal energy production industries 
in addition to designing and fabricating the world s first all titanium high pressure drilling riser in  the company has also produced significant quantities of seamless titanium pipe for use in geothermal energy applications 
the company also supplied titanium stress joints for use in a production riser system located in the gulf of mexico 
the company conducts its operations for oil and gas and geothermal energy from its houston  texas facility under the name rti energy systems  inc rti energy systems also engineers  designs and markets offshore riser systems  stress joints  drill pipe and components 
on december   the company purchased the remaining of the outstanding shares of reamet 
since  the company had owned of the outstanding shares of reamet 
reamet  located in villette  france  is a premier distributor of titanium products to the french market  serving aerospace  military and industrial customers 
its largest customer is aerospatiale  french partner to the airbus consortium  with which it has a contract to supply titanium  principally in the form of cut plate 
reamet now operates as part of the fabrication and distribution group 
rti s strategy is to build on its leading position in the worldwide titanium industry while maintaining a strong financial condition and stringent quality  safety and environmental standards 
rti is emphasizing higher margin products in its traditional markets  while continuing to develop new markets and products such as seamless tubulars for oil and gas and geothermal energy production

outlook following announcements in by boeing of lower commercial aircraft production rates for and due to lower demand  aerospace contractors adjusted production to accommodate the lower rates from boeing and adjusted their inventories downward from peak levels in since then  the titanium industry has been in a cyclical downturn  characterized by reduced demand and lower product pricing 
those conditions prevailed through most of more recently  however  boeing and airbus have announced increased orders and expectations of improved production levels of to for and the inventory of titanium products that existed in the commercial aerospace supply lines as of the end of and throughout  which had exceeded near term demand now appears to be more in line with forecasted production levels 
as a result  it is expected that market conditions for titanium mill products will improve in in addition  the company believes that increased military spending and increased spending on oil and gas exploration and production projects will further strengthen demand in key markets 
based on currently available information  the company anticipates that the us titanium industry s total shipments in will improve from levels  although the amount of increase  if any  cannot be accurately predicted 
if worldwide economic conditions cause commercial airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders  titanium demand and pricing could remain under pressure 
longer term  aerospace forecasters continue to project growth in revenue passenger miles and aircraft demand  particularly in wider body aircraft which generally require more titanium 
on january   rmi entered into an agreement with boeing commercial airplane group whereby rmi would supply boeing and its family of commercial suppliers with up to million pounds of titanium products annually 
the agreement  which began in  has an initial term of five years and  subject to review by the parties in the fourth year  could be extended for an additional five years 
under the accord  boeing receives firm prices in exchange for rmi receiving a minimum volume commitment of million pounds per year 
if volumes drop below the minimum commitment  the contract contains provisions for financial compensation 
in accordance with the agreement  a demand notice of approximately million was presented to boeing commercial airplane group for such compensation since shipments amounted to only million pounds 
the company has not received any of the proceeds related to this claim  nor has it accrued the effect of the expected revenues 
a similar claim was made in connection with shipments  and  on april   boeing settled the contractual claim for approximately million 
the financial impact of this settlement was recorded in other income during the quarter ended june  rmi  through its french distributor and now wholly owned subsidiary  reamet  was chosen by aerospatiale as the major supplier of the titanium flat rolled products required for aerospatiale s airbus programs which began in and extend through requirements are principally for flat rolled products  including value added cut to size shapes 
rmi is the designated sole supplier of titanium mill products for the air force f fighter being built by lockheed martin and boeing 
the contract began in and will continue through the life of the program with approximately aircraft forecast to be produced by the year sales under this contract could potentially total million 
rmi was also selected by military aircraft producers boeing and northrop as the principal supplier of titanium alloy plate and alloy sheet including just in time  cut to size products  for the c transport and the f a hornet program 
the hornet program includes the new e f version which utilizes considerably more titanium than earlier c d models 
the agreement began in may and runs through december rmi is also the principal supplier of alloy sheet to goodrich aerospace aerostructures group  which designs and manufactures engine nacelle systems for large commercial and military aerospace applications 
rmi has contracts with construcciones aeronauticas sa casa of spain and daimler benz aerospace ag of germany for their alloy plate and sheet requirements in connection with the airbus and eurofighter programs 
all three contracts  with potential revenues totaling million  began in and extend through the company was chosen by bae systems ro defence uk to supply the titanium components for the new xm lightweight mm howitzer 
delivery is expected to begin in and continue through  with titanium shipments beginning in initial deliveries will be to the us marine corps  followed by deliveries to the us army and the italian and british armed forces 
it is anticipated that over guns will be produced 
sales under this contract could potentially exceed million 
the company s order backlog increased to million in the fourth quarter of  from million at september   principally due to new business in the energy unit of the fabrication and distribution group 
however  due to continuing soft aerospace demand  and the aerospace inventory adjustments referred to above  the company s total order backlog as of december  was less than the million backlog at december  liquidity and capital resources net cash flows from operating activities totaled million in compared to million in the change in net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   compared to the comparable period was due primarily to increased income and cash generated through working capital reductions 
in  million was generated through a reduction in working capital  and in million was spent on an increase in working capital 
working capital amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital results primarily from an inventory reduction at the company s niles  ohio facility 
the company s working capital ratio was to at december  compared to to at december  during and  the company s cash flow requirements for capital expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations and borrowing under the company s million unsecured credit facility 
the company used cash flow from operations to acquire the remaining of the outstanding shares of reamet in the fourth quarter of no acquisitions were made in the company anticipates that it will be able to fund its working capital requirements and its capital expenditures from funds generated primarily by operations 
rti filed a universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission in for the sale of up to million of debt and or equity securities at an unspecified future date 
the proceeds of any such sale could be utilized to finance acquisitions  capital expenditures or other general purposes 
the company has not issued any debt or equity under the registration since it was filed nor has it any immediate plans to do so 
capital expenditures gross capital expenditures for the years ended december  and amounted to and million  respectively 
included in spending was million related to a new  ton press and site preparation at an ncm location in houston  texas  and million for capital improvements to the production processes in niles  ohio 
the company continues to invest in its enterprise resource planning erp software system and in spent million compared to million spent on the system in rti anticipates that current capital spending plans can be funded using cash provided from internally generated sources 
capital spending for is budgeted at approximately million 
credit agreement rti entered into a credit agreement dated september  the credit facility to replace rmi s existing credit facilities 
this agreement provided for million five year and million one year borrowings  on an unsecured revolving basis  of up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base equal to the sum of of qualifying accounts receivable and of qualifying inventory 
total borrowings were subject to a maximum leverage test in accordance with the agreement 
on may   the company amended the agreement reducing the million facility to million  terminating the million facility  increasing the maximum permitted leverage and increasing certain libor borrowing spreads by 
the company can now borrow up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base equal to the sum of of qualifying accounts receivable and of qualifying inventory 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company  at its option  will be able to borrow at a a base rate which is the higher of pnc bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  or b libor plus a spread ranging from 
to determined by the ratio of the company s consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under this agreement  and  under the leverage covenant  had additional borrowing capacity of approximately million 
at december   million was outstanding under the facility 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations as well as various health and safety laws and regulations that are subject to frequent modifications and revisions 
while the costs of compliance for these matters have not had a material adverse impact on the company in the past  it is impossible to predict accurately the ultimate effect these changing laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
at december   the amount accrued for future environment related costs was million 
based on available information  the company believes its share of potential environmental related costs  before expected contributions from third parties  is in a range from million to million  in the aggregate 
the amount accrued is net of expected contributions from third parties which does not include any amounts from insurers of approximately million  which the company believes are probable 
the company has received contributions from such third parties for a number of years as partial reimbursement for costs incurred by the company 
as these proceedings continue toward final resolution  amounts in excess of those already provided may be necessary to discharge the company from its obligations for these projects 
the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters could individually  or in the aggregate  be material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  management believes that the company will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these matters could be resolved unfavorably 
new accounting standards the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk and price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies used in its manufacturing operations 
the company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available 
the majority of the company s raw material purchases for titanium sponge and titanium tetrachloride are made under long term contracts with negotiated prices 
the company s long term debt is based on rates that float with libor based rates or bank prime rates and the carrying value approximates fair value 
because of the relatively low levels of debt outstanding  the company believes movements in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the company s financial position 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange exposure for purchases of materials  equipment and services  including wages  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as non dollar denominated sales 
from time to time the company may use forward exchange contracts to manage these risks  although they are generally considered to be minimal 
the majority of the company s sales are made in us dollars  which minimizes exposure to foreign currency fluctuation 
as of december   the company had an outstanding purchase commitment of million deutsch marks due at various times through at year end  this purchase commitment was equivalent to million 
the company also had forward contracts for the purchase of million deutsch marks at a contractual rate of deutsch marks per us dollar
