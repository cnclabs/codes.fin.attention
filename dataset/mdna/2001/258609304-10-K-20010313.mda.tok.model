comparability of results altavista agreement in january  we changed the manner in which we report the financial results of the services we performed for the altavista web site 
effective january   we entered into an advertising services agreement with altavista company s predecessor in interest compaq computer corporation that superseded the previously effective procurement and trafficking agreement  dated december and amended in january  between doubleclick and compaq computer corporation s predecessor in interest  digital equipment corp 
until december   we had paid altavista a service fee under the procurement and trafficking agreement which was calculated as a percentage of the revenues earned from advertisers for the delivery of advertisements to users of the altavista web site 
under that agreement  we recognized as revenues the gross amount earned for advertising delivered to users of the altavista web site 
gross amounts billed by us  including amounts billed on behalf of altavista  are referred to as system revenues  and are presented solely to facilitate the comparison of our and results of operations 
beginning january   altavista agreed  under the advertising services agreement  to use our dart technology for ad delivery  and to outsource domestic  international and local ad sales functions to us 
for these services  altavista pays us a technology fee for all advertising delivered by our dart technology to users of the altavista web site  a sales commission based on the net revenues generated from all advertisements sold by doubleclick on behalf of altavista and a fee for all billing and collections services we perform for altavista 
under this agreement  we recognized dart service fees  sales commissions and billing and collection fees as revenues derived from the sale and delivery of impressions on the altavista web site and associated services 
as a result of this change in our relationship with altavista  although there had been no significant change in gross profit dollars  overall gross margin percentage had increased as we were no longer required to pay service fees to altavista for impressions sold and delivered on the altavista web site and revenues include the fees earned for services rendered 
in november  we entered into an interim advertising services agreement  effective from november  through december  with altavista  which temporarily suspended the advertising services agreement 
the interim services agreement temporarily adjusted some advertising sales arrangements between us and altavista  but did not change the manner in which we recognized revenues derived from our services for the altavista web site 
on august   we announced a restructuring of our advertising services agreement with altavista new agreement 
under the new agreement  altavista agreed to assume lead ad sales responsibility for domestic advertisers by february  and international advertisers by december subject to altavista s right to assume lead responsibility sooner in certain international markets 
after altavista assumes lead ad responsibility in a market  doubleclick will have the right to sell ads on the altavista web sites in that market on a non exclusive basis  as part of doubleclick s worldwide ad networks  through december  in addition  under the new agreement  the dart for publishers service will serve ads on altavista s web sites through december  with the ads required to be served through the dart for publishers service declining in each year of the agreement  subject to certain minimums 
the dart for advertisers service will serve the majority of altavista s online advertising campaigns through december business combinations in july  we contributed our wholly owned subsidiary  netgravity japan  to our affiliate doubleclick japan in return for an additional ownership interest in doubleclick japan 
in addition to increasing our equity interest to approximately  the agreement with doubleclick japan enables us to nominate a majority of the seats on doubleclick japan s board of directors and exercise a controlling financial interest in its operations 
pursuant to apb  business combinations  we have consolidated the net assets and results of operations of doubleclick japan as of the date of the transfer 
as doubleclick japan s net assets and results of operations had not previously been consolidated in our financial statements  this simultaneous transfer and acquisition was treated as a partial sale of our interest in netgravity japan and a step acquisition of an additional equity interest in doubleclick japan 
full reverse acquisition accounting was used and a million gain recognized to the extent that netgravity japan was deemed sold to the minority shareholders of doubleclick japan 
this gain has been included in gain on equity transactions of affiliates  net in our consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill of million was also recorded to reflect the proportionate step up in doubleclick japan s assets as the result of the reverse acquisition 
subsequent to the transfer of netgravity japan described above  doubleclick made an additional investment of million in doubleclick japan  which increased our interest in doubleclick japan to approximately 
this investment was accounted for as a step acquisition and doubleclick recorded approximately million of goodwill  which represents the excess of its additional investment over the fair value of the incremental assets acquired 
effective may   we acquired flashbase  inc flashbase for approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition  which has been accounted for under the purchase method  we recorded approximately million in goodwill 
an additional amount payable in either cash or doubleclick common stock  at our election  will be made in march based on the continued employment of the former shareholders and the attainment of specific performance objectives through the year ended december  we intend to pay million of this amount in cash and the remainder in doubleclick common stock 
we have recorded approximately million in non cash compensation expense related to the contingently issuable shares for the year ended december  such amounts are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we consummated mergers with netgravity  abacus and opt in email 
com during which have been accounted for as poolings of interests 
we acquired the remaining interests not previously owned by us in doubleclick scandinavia ab in december and doubleclick iberoamerica sl in november these transactions were accounted for as purchases 
on february   we completed our acquisition of plan 
inc  a leading provider of online target market research planning systems 
under the final terms of the acquisition  which qualifies as a tax free reorganization for united states federal income tax purposes  we paid in cash and of a share of doubleclick stock for each outstanding share of plan common stock 
our purchase price  exclusive of direct acquisition costs  was approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of plan s net assets acquired will be allocated to intangible assets  which includes goodwill  and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
on february   we entered into an agreement to acquire flonetwork inc  an email marketing technology provider 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval by flonetwork s shareholders and canadian governmental authorities  and is expected to close in the second quarter of results of operations revenues and gross profit by segment are as follows revenues gross profit year ended december  year ended december  in thousands media       technology       data       intersegment elimination    total       compared to revenues and gross profits increased over primarily as the result of volume increases both domestically and internationally and a more favorable product mix  partially offset by declines associated with the decrease in revenue derived from advertising impressions delivered to users of the altavista web site as the result of the restructuring of our advertising services agreement  which is described above

revenue for doubleclick media increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  doubleclick media gross margin was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase in doubleclick media revenue was due to an increase in online ad spending on the worldwide doubleclick networks 
gross margin decreased primarily due to the write off of our advance to a web publisher in december excluding this one time charge  gross margin would have been for the year ended december  gross margin also declined due to increases in the amounts of unsold inventory  which diluted the effective price of delivered advertising impressions 
gross margin further decreased due to a reduction in the proportion of revenue derived from advertising impressions delivered to users of the altavista web site 
although doubleclick media revenues increased substantially from to  we experienced a smaller sequential quarter to quarter growth rate towards the end of  and we anticipate that quarterly media revenues will be lower than levels at least during the first half of doubleclick media revenue derived from advertising impressions delivered to the users of the altavista web site was million  or of doubleclick media revenue for the year ended december   compared to million  or of doubleclick media revenue for the year ended december  because of specific contractual terms unique to altavista  we recognize revenue from sales commissions  billing and collection fees and dart service fees derived from the sale and delivery of ads on the altavista web site and associated services

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of days 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  fair value in thousands cash and cash equivalents   average interest rate fixed rate investments in marketable securities    average interest rate convertible subordinated notes   average interest rate we did not hold derivative financial instruments as of december  and have never held these instruments in the past 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries and are thus subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses in the united kingdom and countries whose currency is the euro 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended december  was not material 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge operating activities denominated in foreign currencies 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies 
the introduction of the euro has not had a material impact on how we conduct business and we do not anticipate any changes in how we conduct business as a result of increased price transparency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors
