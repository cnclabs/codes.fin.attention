we do not intend to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
for additional information about factors that may affect our business  see risk factors on pages management strategy overview eleven is the world s largest operator  franchisor and licensor of convenience stores and the largest convenience store chain in north america 
over the last several years we have refined our business strategy to take advantage of our widely recognized brand and to leverage our size  technology and people  including the following key elements information technology provides our stores with a competitive edge 
our proprietary retail information system ris is designed to build efficiencies into ordering  distribution and merchandising processes and to provide timely and accurate store information on an item by item basis 
merchandising is aided by ris technology  as product availability is improved by ensuring high demand products are always available 
brand strength and scale enable us to capitalize on co merchandising opportunities with key vendors to develop and introduce products that are first  best or available only at eleven 
an example of new product development includes the limited rollout in test stores of a web enabled  integrated financial services kiosk that merges the capabilities of an atm with the benefits of the internet 
during the initial stage of introduction  these kiosks will provide financial services beyond those of a conventional atm  including money orders  money transfers and check cashing 
in the future  services such as bill payment  deposit capability  event ticketing and travel directions are anticipated 
our fresh food program continues to evolve and we believe this category represents a tremendous opportunity  as food to go increases in popularity 
our network of third party commissary bakery operators and combined distribution centers cdcs delivers world ovens baked goods  milk and bread  fresh made sandwiches and other foods daily to over  stores 
developing new stores continues to be a major initiative and accordingly we opened new stores in the united states and canada in in we plan to open approximately to new stores  focusing on existing markets to further leverage our infrastructure and maximize the efficiencies of the cdcs 
general our revenue principally consists of merchandise and gasoline sales and to a lesser extent royalty income from licensees 
our primary expense consists of cost of goods sold  operating expenses  interest expense and taxes 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes to be relevant to understanding eleven s financial condition and results of operations 
comparison of to results except where noted as same store  all per store numbers refer to an average of all stores rather than only stores open more than one year 
net sales years ended december net sales in millions merchandise sales   gasoline sales   total net sales   merchandise sales growth us same store gasoline gallons sold   gasoline gallon sales change per store average retail price of gasoline per gallon merchandise sales for increased million  or  over we attribute this increase to us same store merchandise sales growth of and operating an average of additional stores in as compared to the largest contributors to the merchandise sales growth were cigarettes  prepaid cards  beer  non carbonated beverages  coffee and snacks 
wholesale cigarette cost increases  which were reflected in higher retail prices  accounted for less than two percentage points of the increase in us same store merchandise sales  while contributing approximately five percent to the same store growth 
growth in other categories was fueled by new items  equipment upgrades and an improved product assortment  which was offset  in part  by decreases in the sales of frozen beverages  newspapers and other publications 
gasoline sales for increased million  or  over we attribute this increase primarily to a higher average retail price of gasoline and operating an average of additional gasoline stores 
the average retail price of gasoline was per gallon in  a cent increase over we believe the high price of gasoline adversely affected the demand for gasoline and accordingly impacted our gallons sold 
gallons sold per store increased over  the result of adding new stores  whose average gallon volume is higher than our existing store average 
industry wide  the demand for gas was flat in  compared to gross profit years ended december gross profit in millions merchandise gross profit   gasoline gross profit total gross profit   merchandise gross profit margin merchandise gross profit growth per store gasoline gross profit margin cents per gallon gasoline gross profit change per store merchandise gross profit for increased million  or  over as a result of higher sales  combined with gross profit margin improvement to from the prior year s 
gross profit margin improvement was due to a combination of a change in product mix and reduced shortages  which we attribute to initiatives put in place to improve store level accountability 
gasoline gross profit for increased million  or  over as a result of new gasoline outlets opened in and in addition  gasoline gross profit margin improved to cents per gallon for compared to cents per gallon in our gasoline strategy is to manage by daily price and volume tracking at store level  which helps minimize the adverse effects of gasoline volatility 
as a result of these factors  gasoline gross profit per store increased for the year  compared to other income other income for was million  an increase of million  or  from million in we attribute this increase to higher royalty income from our area licensees  resulting from both higher sales at stores operated by licensees and an increase in the number of such stores  combined with additional franchise fees 
we received nearly million of royalties from an area license agreement with seven eleven japan during royalty payments from seven eleven japan will be reduced by approximately in accordance with the terms of the amended license agreement one year following the final repayment of our yen denominated loan 
at the current trend  we project the yen denominated loan will be fully repaid during the third quarter of franchisee gross profit expense we report all sales and gross profits from domestic franchised stores in our consolidated results and record as an expense a percentage of the gross profits generated by those same franchised stores 
franchisee gross profit expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from million in we attribute this to higher per store gross profits at franchised stores and an increase in the number of stores operated by franchisees 
operating  selling  general and administrative expense osg a osg a for was  million  an increase of million  or  from  million in the increase in osg a was partly due to the cost of operating an average of more stores  approximately million of incremental costs related to the implementation of our proprietary retail information system and increased credit card processing charges  due in part to the significantly higher gasoline prices 
the ratio of osg a to net sales decreased to for from for in  osg a included a credit of million related to environmental legislation changes in california  which was partially offset by million of severance expenses 
after adjusting for these items and assuming that the average retail price of gasoline for was reduced to the level which prevailed in  the ratio of osg a to net sales would have increased slightly to in  from in for  we expect the operational costs for our california stores to rise because electricity prices in california have increased significantly over the past few months 
interest expense  net net interest expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in repayment of borrowings with proceeds from the sale of common stock to iyg holding company on march  see liquidity and capital resources for more information was the primary contributor to the decrease 
net interest expense in is expected to decrease approximately million  compared to  based on anticipated levels of debt and interest rate projections 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 we do not recognize interest expense on our debentures in our statement of earnings 
these debentures are recorded at an amount equal to the future undiscounted cash payments  both principal and interest 
accordingly  the cash interest payments are charged against the recorded amount of the debentures and are not treated as interest expense 
income tax expense income tax expense on earnings before extraordinary gains for was million and million in the expense is net of a non recurring benefit of million  which resulted from a favorable settlement with the internal revenue service related to audits of our federal income taxes for the through tax years 
excluding the non recurring benefit  our effective tax rate was for and in extraordinary gain in december  we purchased million of the outstanding principal of debt related to cityplace  our corporate headquarters  for million  resulting in a million after tax gain see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we redeemed million of our debentures resulting in a million after tax gain 
this gain resulted from the retirement of future undiscounted interest payments as recorded under sfas no 
 combined with repurchasing a portion of the debentures below their face amount 
net earnings net earnings for were million per diluted share  an increase of million  or  from million per diluted share in net earnings before extraordinary gains see preceding paragraph were million per diluted share for  an increase of million  or  from million per diluted share in the diluted per share data reflects a one for five reverse split of our common stock effected may  seasonality weather conditions can have a significant impact on our sales  as buying patterns have shown that our customers increase their transactions and also purchase higher profit margin products when weather conditions are favorable 
consequently  our results are seasonal  and accordingly we typically earn more during the warmer second and third quarters 
comparison of to results net sales years ended december net sales in millions merchandise sales   gasoline sales   total net sales   merchandise sales growth us same store gasoline gallons sold   gasoline gallon sales change per store average retail price of gasoline per gallon merchandise sales for increased million  or  over we attribute this increase to us same store merchandise sales growth of and operating an average of additional stores in as compared to excluding the impact of cigarette cost increases passed through to customers  our us same store merchandise sales were approximately higher in as compared to categories contributing to us same store merchandise sales growth were prepaid phone cards  trading cards and non carbonated beverages  primarily as a result of new product introductions 
this growth was offset  in part  by decreases in the sales of newspapers  carbonated beverages and prepackaged bakery goods 
gasoline sales for increased million  or  over we attribute this increase to a higher average retail price of gasoline  higher average gallons sold per store and operating an average of additional gasoline stores 
the average retail price of gasoline was per gallon in  a increase from per gallon in average gallons sold per store increased over  primarily due to adding new higher volume stores 
gross profit years ended december gross profit in millions merchandise gross profit   gasoline gross profit total gross profit   merchandise gross profit margin merchandise gross profit growth per store gasoline gross profit margin cents per gallon gasoline gross profit change per store merchandise gross profit for increased million  or  over we attribute this increase to higher us same store merchandise sales and our operating a larger number of stores 
our gross profit margin was in compared to in this margin decline was principally the result of lower gross margin on cigarettes due to wholesale and retail price increases 
while our margin on cigarettes decreased in  per store gross profits generated from cigarette sales increased primarily due to more effective merchandising 
somewhat offsetting the margin decline was the successful introduction of new higher margin products including pokemon trading cards  eleven frut cooler and eleven bakery stix  combined with increased sales of some traditional higher margin products  such as coffee and non carbonated beverages 
merchandise gross profit per store increased in compared to gasoline gross profit for increased million  or  from million in  which represents an increase of per store 
we attribute this increase in gasoline gross profit to higher gallons sold per store and operating a larger number of gasoline stores in as compared to  partially offset by a decline in gasoline gross profit margin to cents per gallon in from cents per gallon in we attribute this margin decrease primarily to rising wholesale gasoline costs 
other income other income for was million  an increase of million  or  from million in  primarily due to increased franchise fees 
in addition  royalty income from our area licensees increased as a result of higher sales at stores operated by licensees and an increase in the number of such stores 
franchisee gross profit expense franchisee gross profit expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from million in we attribute this increase to higher gross profits at franchised stores 
operating  selling  general and administrative expense osg a for was  million  an increase of million  or  from  million in we attribute this increase primarily to higher store labor costs  the costs of operating a larger number of stores  approximately million of incremental costs related to the implementation of our proprietary retail information system and additional costs associated with other strategic initiatives 
the ratio of osg a to net sales decreased to for from for in  osg a included a credit of million related to environmental legislation changes in california  which was partially offset by million of severance expenses 
in  osg a included million associated with the write offs of computer equipment and development costs and million in severance and related costs 
after adjusting for these items and assuming that the average retail price of gasoline for was reduced to the level which prevailed in  the ratio of osg a to net sales would have been basically flat year over year 
interest expense  net net interest expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from million in we attribute this increase to higher borrowing levels incurred to finance new store development  other initiatives and the redemption of a total of million of our debentures in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of see extraordinary gain for more information 
we accounted for the redeemed debentures in accordance with sfas no 
 accordingly  we did not recognize interest expense on these debentures in our statement of earnings 
as a result  interest expense on debt used to redeem our debentures increased our reported interest expense 
income tax expense income tax expense on earnings before extraordinary gains for was million compared to million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in extraordinary gain in  we redeemed million of our debentures resulting in a million after tax gain 
during  we redeemed million of our debentures resulting in a million after tax gain 
these gains resulted from the retirement of future undiscounted interest payments as recorded under sfas no 
 combined with repurchasing a portion of the debentures below their face amount 
net earnings net earnings for were million per diluted share  an increase of million  or  from million per diluted share in net earnings before extraordinary gains see preceding paragraph for were million per diluted share  an increase of million  or  from million per diluted share in the diluted per share data reflects a one for five reverse split of our common stock effected may  liquidity and capital resources the majority of our working capital is provided from three sources cash flows generated from our operating activities  a million commercial paper facility  guaranteed by ito yokado co  ltd  and seasonal borrowings of up to million under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that operating activities  coupled with available working capital facilities  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operating and capital expenditure programs  as well as to service debt requirements 
the outstanding balance at december  for commercial paper was million  while there were no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
we expect capital expenditures for  excluding lease commitments  to be in excess of million  which includes capital associated with opening or acquiring approximately to new stores 
on january   we entered into a new unsecured bank credit agreement  refinancing the old credit agreement  which was scheduled to mature on february   with a new million revolving credit facility 
the new revolving credit facility contains a sub limit of million for letters of credit 
as of december   outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement totaled million 
on january   we entered into a new lease facility that will provide up to million of off balance sheet financing to be used for the construction of new stores 
funding under this facility is available through january of  with a final maturity of the leases in july on march   iyg holding company purchased  newly issued shares of our common stock for million  or per share  in a private placement transaction 
we used the net proceeds from this transaction to repay the outstanding balance on our bank term loan  to repay the outstanding balance of our bank revolver and to reduce indebtedness under our commercial paper facility 
in january  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement for of our store properties whereby we sold land  buildings and related improvements  which were then leased back to us 
we received net proceeds of million on the sale 
the sale resulted in approximately million of deferred gains  which we will recognize on a straight line basis over the initial term of the leases 
we used all of the proceeds from this transaction to pay down our revolving credit facility 
in august  we entered into a lease facility that provides up to million of off balance sheet financing to be used for the construction of new stores 
funding under this facility is available through august with a final maturity of the leases in february as of december   million was funded under this facility  which we expect will be fully funded by the end of the second quarter of cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million in  an increase of million 
we attribute this to increased levels of net earnings as adjusted for non cash items and changes in certain balance sheet amounts 
included in the changes in balance sheet amounts was an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities resulting from a change in terms with one of our major vendors 
in addition  inventory levels were lower in  due in large part to a strategic buildup of inventories in preparation for potential yk related sales in december of cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for  compared to million in payments for capital expenditures were million for  compared to million in in addition  we received million of net proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction during  compared to million in capital expenditures for each of the periods were used for new store development  continued implementation of our retail information system  new equipment to support merchandising initiatives as well as upgrading store and gasoline facilities and equipment and compliance with environmental regulations 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in net repayments under commercial paper and revolving credit facilities totaled million for  compared to net borrowings of million in net long term debt repayments for were million  compared to million in cash from financing activities for also included million in net proceeds from issuance of common stock that was used to pay down debt 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion summarizes the financial and derivative instruments we held as of december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
we use interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
in addition  our two yen denominated loans effectively serve as an economic hedge of our exposure to yen dollar currency fluctuations 
the instruments we hold are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
on march   we received million in proceeds from a private placement transaction 
we used these proceeds to reduce floating rate debt  which has lowered our exposure to interest rate risk see liquidity and capital resources for more information 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not represented in this discussion 
interest rate risk management the table below presents descriptions of the floating rate financial instruments and interest rate derivative instruments we held at december  we entered into an interest rate swap to achieve the levels of variable and fixed rate debt approved by senior management 
under the interest rate swap  we agreed with other parties to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts on a quarterly basis 
for the debt  the table below presents principal cash flows that exist by maturity date and the related average interest rate 
for the swap  the table presents the notional amounts outstanding and expected interest rates that exist by contractual dates 
we used the notional amount to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract and estimated the variable rates based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
dollars in millions thereafter total fair value floating rate financial instrument commercial paper average interest rate interest rate derivatives notional amount average pay rate average receive rate the negative million fair value of the interest rate swap represents an estimate of the amount we would pay to the counterparty if we had chosen to terminate the swap as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information on floating rate and fixed rate liabilities as well as fair value and derivative discussions 
as of december   approximately of our debt contained floating rates that will be unfavorably impacted by rising interest rates 
we have effectively eliminated of our exposure to rising interest rates through an interest rate swap agreement 
the weighted average interest rate for such debt  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was for the year ended december   as compared to in foreign exchange risk management we recorded more than million in royalty income in that could have been impacted by fluctuating exchange rates 
approximately of such royalties were from area license agreements with seven eleven japan sej 
sej royalty income has not fluctuated with exchange rate movements  as we have effectively hedged this exposure by using the royalty income to make principal and interest payments on our yen denominated loans 
this economic hedge remains  although sfas no 
nullified the accounting treatment we were applying to the sej royalty and yen denominated loans 
as a result  both the sej royalty and yen denominated loans are subject to exchange rate fluctuations see recently issued accounting standard 
in addition  we are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates on the non seven eleven japan portion of our royalties earned in foreign currency  but we do not believe future risk is material based on current estimates 
we have several wholly or partially owned foreign subsidiaries and are susceptible to exchange rate risk on earnings from these subsidiaries  however  based on current estimates  we do not consider future foreign exchange risk to be material 
equity price risk management we hold equity securities of other companies  which are classified as available for sale and are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
at december   we held  shares of affiliated computer services  inc acs common stock  which had no cost  but had a fair value of million 
we obtained the acs stock in  as partial consideration for our entering into a mainframe data processing contract with acs 
at the time  acs was a privately held start up company  and  accordingly  the stock was valued with no cost 
changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive earnings  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders equity 
other issues environmental in december  we closed our chemical manufacturing facility in new jersey 
we are required to conduct environmental remediation at the facility  including groundwater monitoring and treatment for a projected year period  which commenced in we have recorded undiscounted liabilities  representing our best estimates of the clean up costs  of million at december  in  we entered into a settlement agreement with the former owner of the facility pursuant to which the former owner agreed to pay a substantial portion of the clean up costs 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement and the financial resources of the former owner  we have a receivable recorded of million at december  additionally  we accrue for the anticipated future costs and the related probable state reimbursement amounts for remediation activities at our existing and previously operated gasoline sites where releases of regulated substances have been detected 
at december   our estimated undiscounted liability for these sites was million 
this estimate is based on our prior experience with gasoline sites and contractors who perform environmental assessment and remediation work as well as other factors such as the age of the tanks and the location of tank sites 
we anticipate that substantially all of the future remediation costs for detected releases of regulated substances at those remediation sites of which we are aware  as of december   will be incurred within the next four to five years 
under state reimbursement programs  we are eligible to receive reimbursement for a portion of future remediation costs  as well as a portion of remediation costs previously paid 
accordingly  at december   we had recorded a net receivable of million based on the estimated state reimbursements 
in assessing the probability of state reimbursements  we take into consideration each state s fund balance  revenue sources  existing claim backlog  status of clean up activity and claim ranking systems 
as a result of these assessments  the recorded receivable amount is net of an allowance of million 
while there can be no assurance of the timing of the receipt of state reimbursement funds  based on our experience we expect to receive the majority of state reimbursement funds  except from california  within one to three years after our payment of eligible remediation expenses 
this time period assumes that the state administrative procedures for processing such reimbursements have been fully developed 
we estimate that we will receive california reimbursement funds within one to ten years after our payment of eligible remediation expenses 
as a result of the timing for reimbursements  we have present valued the portion of the recorded receivable amount that relates to remediation activities that have already been completed at a discount rate of approximately 
thus  the recorded receivable amount is also net of a discount of million 
the estimated future assessment and remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change in the future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised 
litigation we are a defendant in two legal actions  which are referred to as the eleven owners for fair franchising and the valente cases  filed by franchisees in and  respectively 
a nationwide settlement was negotiated in  and  in connection with the settlement  these two cases were combined on behalf of a class of all persons who franchised eleven convenience stores from us in the united states at any time between january  and july  a total of of the class members have approved the settlement  and the court presiding over the settlement process gave its final approval of the settlement on april  the settlement provides that class members who are former franchisees will share in a settlement fund  that we will make certain changes to the franchise agreements of class members who are current franchisees and that we will pay certain attorney fees 
our accruals are sufficient to cover the total settlement costs  including payments due to former franchisees when the settlement becomes effective 
certain parties challenged the settlement in an appeal to the california court of appeal  which affirmed the settlement on december  the opponents of the settlement filed a petition for review asking the california supreme court to review the settlement 
assuming the california supreme court decides not to grant review  the settlement will become final during the second quarter of recently issued accounting standard we have completed our review of derivative instruments and other contracts that might be considered or contain derivative instruments in connection with our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
as of january  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 the million interest rate swap will be treated as a cash flow hedge of our interest rate exposure in connection with our commercial paper program 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the transitional adjustment was to record a liability of million representing the fair value of the interest rate swap as of january   with the offset of million net of deferred taxes of  to accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
the carrying value of the interest rate swap will be adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date with a corresponding offset to accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
additionally  a review of the effectiveness of the interest rate swap at each reporting date will be performed and the ineffective portion of the interest rate swap will be recognized in earnings for the period reported 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we transferred january   asset and liability balances of million and million  respectively  related to the interest rate swap to accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
these balances will continue to be amortized into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense through february as discussed in foreign exchange risk management and note  we use the sej royalty receipts to service the monthly principal and interest payments on our yen loans 
this arrangement provides an effective economic hedge against fluctuations in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
as a result of this hedge  our yen denominated loans and related interest expense and payable had previously been recorded in the consolidated financial statements utilizing the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rates in effect at the date of the borrowings for the yen loan and for the yen loan 
additionally  the sej royalty had been recorded at the exchange rate as it has been utilized to service the yen loan 
although sfas no 
nullified the hedge accounting treatment the company was applying to the sej royalty and yen loans  the effective economic hedge against changes in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate remains in place 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we converted the yen loans  related interest payable and the sej royalty receivable to reflect the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate quoted for january  yen to one us dollar 
as a result  our transitional adjustment increased the yen loans  related interest payable and sej royalty receivable by million  with the offsetting reduction of million net of deferred taxes of million to accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
the transitional adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive earnings will be amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the yen loans 
prospectively  we will adjust the balance of the yen loans at each reporting date to reflect the current japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate  and the resultant foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized in earnings 
in addition  we will record the sej royalty and interest expense on the yen loans at the average japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate for the respective period
