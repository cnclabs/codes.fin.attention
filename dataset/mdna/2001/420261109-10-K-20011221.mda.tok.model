overall summary sales in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal net income for fiscal was  or per share  compared to  or per share for fiscal the decrease in net income was primarily due to additional costs of operations due to the spring flooding at our terminals and to the lifo method of valuing inventories see gross margin discussion below 
return on average shareholders equity was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal book value per share at september  was compared to one year ago 
sales for the year ended september   sales increased  a increase from fiscal  due to an increase of  in industrial segment sales and an increase of  in water treatment segment sales 
the industrial segment increase is mainly due to an increase in the selling price of caustic soda and volume increases in other product lines  which were partially offset by a decrease in the volume of caustic soda sold 
the water treatment segment increase is due mainly to an increase in volumes 
for the year ended october   sales increased  a increase from fiscal  due to an increase of  in water treatment segment sales partially offset by a decrease of  in industrial segment sales 
the water treatment segment increase is due to an increase in volumes of products sold 
the industrial segment decrease is due to a decrease in the selling price of caustic soda partially offset by an increase in volume of caustic soda sold and the majority of other products sold in this segment 
gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the gross margin variations are due to a number of variables in both segments as explained below 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the industrial segment was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal decrease compared to fiscal was primarily due to the cost of caustic soda  which began to increase at the beginning of fiscal year and continued to increase during the first eight months of the fiscal year 
due to the large quantities of caustic soda that we had on hand at the beginning of the fiscal year and because we are on the lifo method of valuing inventories  this increase negatively impacted gross margins 
the company implemented caustic soda price increases during the year  however market pressures prevented the company from recovering all of the increased caustic soda costs 
additionally  an increase in the volume of caustic soda in the year end inventory combined with the increase in cost of caustic soda resulted in an increase in the lifo reserve  all of which negatively affected earnings by million or 
per share 
the company attempts to maintain relatively constant dollar margins as the cost of this product line increases and decreases 
the cost of this product is normally subject to fluctuations  which are expected to continue in future periods 
by maintaining relatively stable dollar margins  the gross margin percentage will decrease when the cost of the product is increasing and will increase when the cost of the product is decreasing 
the fiscal increase over fiscal was due to the company s ability to maintain relatively constant profit margins as caustic soda costs were decreasing 
the company has also generally been able to  and expects to continue to  adjust its selling prices as the cost of materials and other expenses change 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the water treatment segment was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal gross margin decrease in comparison to fiscal was attributable to the aforementioned increase in caustic soda costs and additional costs associated with the new red rock facility 
the fiscal gross margin was comparable to fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively over the previous years 
these increases are primarily attributable to the company s investment in infrastructure necessary to support future sales increases as well as a larger  more geographically dispersed organization 
the fiscal increase over fiscal was mainly due to increases in the sales staff  consulting fees  amortization of intangibles related to the may  st 
mary s chemicals  inc acquisition  and to employee benefits costs 
the fiscal increase over fiscal was mainly due to increases in the sales and administrative staff  consulting fees and to employee benefits costs

litigation and settlement costs related to fire prior to september  the company paid and expensed million in settlement and legal costs and for other costs in connection with the company s defense of a lawsuit filed against it in minnesota entitled donna m 
cooksey  et al 
v 
hawkins chemical  inc 
and the lynde company 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit sought damages for personal injury and other damages alleged to have been caused by the release of hazardous substances as a result of a fire at an office warehouse facility occupied by the lynde company  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs 
most  but not all  of the claimants have now been paid under the settlement agreement 
the company s primary and umbrella insurers denied coverage and refused to defend the lawsuit 
during fiscal  the company prevailed in its claims against its insurers and has been reimbursed  for substantially all of its settlement and legal expenses 
in addition  the company anticipates that the defense and payment of the remaining claims will be covered by the umbrella insurer 
special charges during fiscal  the company entered into termination agreements with three former employees due to corporate organizational changes and recorded special charges in the statement of income of other income interest income decreased  in fiscal as compared to the previous year due to less cash available for investment and a lower rate of return on the company s available for sale securities which consist primarily of municipal bonds and annuity contracts 
interest income decreased  in fiscal as compared to the previous year due to less cash available for investment 
interest expense decreased in fiscal and fiscal as compared to the previous year 
most of the interest expense is the result of the company issuing a note payable to the seller in connection with the acquisition of the assets of industrial chemical equipment company in provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended september   for the fiscal year ended october   and for the fiscal year ended october  the fiscal decrease compared to fiscal and was due to changes in state apportionment factors and a deduction for dividends paid on allocated shares held in the employee stock ownership plan

inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company during the past three fiscal years  as selling prices have generally been adjusted as the cost of materials and other expenses have changed 
on occasion  however  slight fluctuations in the cost of a single  large volume product historically have not been reflected in the selling price of that product 
financial condition liquidity cash provided by operations in fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal and compared to fiscal was due primarily to fluctuations in inventory values and to the recovery of litigation expenses in fiscal cash and investments available for sale decreased by  to  at the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to capital expenditures

if the need for additional financing arises  however  management will consider issuance of debt or equity if such financing can be obtained on favorable terms 
although management continually looks for companies to acquire and for ways to modernize its facilities and equipment  no material commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures currently exist 
other than as discussed above  management is not aware of any matters or trends that have materially affected the results of operations for fiscal that are not expected to have either short or long term implications  nor is it aware of any trends or other matters that have not materially affected results in fiscal but are expected to have a material effect on future periods

the fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase

consequently the company would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on net income or cash flows or the amount ultimately realized on the investment 
the value of the mutual funds  like all mutual funds  may increase or decrease due to market volatility 
the company intends to hold the mutual funds and does not anticipate a need to liquidate its investments and therefore would not expect a material adverse impact on net income or cash flows or the amount ultimately realized on the investment
