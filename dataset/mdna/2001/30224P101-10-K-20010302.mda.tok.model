item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general extended stay america  inc was organized on january  as a delaware corporation to develop  own  and operate extended stay lodging facilities 
studio plus hotels  inc was formed in december and acquired all of the assets of the sph predecessor entities  which owned and operated studioplus tm extended stay facilities since the acquisition of the interests of the sph predecessor entities was accounted for as if it were a pooling of interests 
on april   we completed a merger with sph 
the  shares of sph common stock that were outstanding on the closing date were converted into  shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of sph common stock were converted into options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
as a result of the merger  sph became one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
our accompanying consolidated financial statements give effect to the merger  which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we own and operate three brands in the extended stay lodging market studioplus tm deluxe studios  extended stayamerica efficiency studios  and crossland economy studios sm 
each brand is designed to appeal to different price points below per week 
all three brands offer the same core components a living sleeping area  a fully equipped kitchen or kitchenette  and a bathroom 
extended stay rooms are designed to compete in the economy category 
crossland rooms are typically smaller than extended stay rooms and are targeted for the budget category  and studioplus facilities serve the mid price category and generally feature larger guest rooms  an exercise room  and a swimming pool 
during  we repositioned studioplus properties as extended stay properties 
all operating statistics reflect the repositioning of these properties as extended stay properties for the entire periods presented 
the table below provides a summary of our selected development and operational results for   and year ended december  total facilities open at period end total facilities developed average occupancy rate average weekly room rate average occupancy rates are determined by dividing the rooms occupied on a daily basis by the total number of rooms 
due to our rapid expansion  our overall average occupancy rate has been negatively impacted by the lower occupancy typically experienced during the pre stabilization period for newly opened facilities 
we expect the negative impact on overall average occupancy to decline as the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties in operation declines 
average weekly room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms occupied on a daily basis for the applicable period and multiplying by seven 
the average weekly room rates generally will be greater than standard room rates because of stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  higher weekly rates for rooms that are larger than the standard rooms  and additional charges for more than one person per room 
we expect that our future occupancy and room rates will be impacted by a number of factors  including the number and geographic location of new facilities as well as the season in which we open those facilities 
we also cannot assure you that we can maintain our occupancy and room rates 
at december   we had operating facilities crossland  extended stay  and studioplus and had facilities under construction extended stay and studioplus 
we expect to complete the construction of the facilities currently under construction generally within the next twelve months  however  we cannot assure you that we will complete construction within the time periods we have historically experienced 
our ability to complete construction may be materially impacted by various factors including final permitting and obtaining certificates of occupancy  as well as weather induced construction delays 
results of operations compared to property operations the following is a summary of the number of properties in operation at the end of each year along with the related average occupancy rates and average weekly room rates during each year year ended year ended december  december  average average average weekly average weekly facilities occupancy room facilities occupancy room open rate rate open rate rate crossland extended stay 
studioplus total because newly opened properties typically experience lower occupancies during their pre stabilization period  average occupancy rates are impacted by the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties 
each of our brands experienced a decline in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties for as compared to the impact of this decline in the ratio of newly opened properties  along with increases in occupancy at our mature properties  resulted in an increase in our overall average occupancy rate to for compared to for the average occupancy rate in for the properties we owned and operated as of january  was 
similarly  the average occupancy rate in for the properties we owned and operated as of january  was 
we believe that the increase in the average occupancy rate for properties open for at least one year at the beginning of each year reflects  primarily  increases in the overall demand for lodging products in various markets in which we operate 
in addition  we believe that our occupancies benefited from a strategy implemented at the beginning of to establish a more competitive pricing structure for our products 
the increase in overall average weekly room rates for as compared to reflects  primarily  the geographic dispersion of properties opened during and the higher standard weekly room rates in certain of those markets 
the increase also is due in part to increases in rates charged at previously opened properties 
the average weekly room rate for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods increased by in we believe that the average weekly room rate for these properties was impacted by a strategy implemented at the beginning of to establish a more competitive pricing structure 
we believe that this pricing strategy contributed to an increase in the occupancy at these properties 
we recognized total revenue of million in and million in this is an increase of million  or 
approximately million of the increased revenue was attributable to properties that we opened during and and approximately million was attributable to an increase in revenue for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods 
property operating expenses  consisting of all expenses directly allocable to the operation of the facilities but excluding any allocation of corporate operating and property management expenses  depreciation  or interest were million of total revenue for  as compared to million of total revenue for we expect the ratio of property operating expenses to total revenue to generally fluctuate inversely relative to occupancy rate increases or decreases because the majority of these expenses do not vary based on occupancy 
our overall occupancy rates were for and for and our property operating margins were for and for the provisions for depreciation and amortization for our lodging facilities were million for and million for these provisions were computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
these provisions reflect a pro rata allocation of the annual depreciation and amortization charge for the periods for which the facilities were in operation 
depreciation and amortization for increased compared to because we operated additional facilities in and because we operated for a full year the properties that were opened in corporate operations corporate operating and property management expenses include all expenses not directly related to the development or operation of lodging facilities 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel and certain marketing costs  as well as development costs that are not directly related to a site that we will develop 
we incurred corporate operating and property management expenses of million of total revenue in and million of total revenue in the increase in the amount of these expenses for as compared to reflects the impact of additional personnel and related expenses in connection with the increased number of facilities we operated 
we expect these expenses will continue to increase in total amount but decline moderately as a percentage of revenue as we develop and operate additional facilities in the future 
depreciation and amortization was million for and million for these provisions were computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for assets not directly related to the operation of our facilities 
these assets were primarily office furniture and equipment 
we realized  of interest income during and  of interest income during this interest income was primarily attributable to the temporary investment of funds drawn under our credit facilities 
we incurred interest charges of million during and million during of these amounts  million during and million during was capitalized and included in the cost of buildings and improvements 
we recognized income tax expense of million of income before taxes for and million of income before taxes for our income tax expense differs from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to state and local income taxes 
we expect that our annualized effective income tax rate for will be approximately 
other charges income in  unfavorable capital market conditions resulted in a reduction in our development plans for and as a result  we established a valuation allowance of million for the write off of costs related to sites that would not be developed 
the operating results for reflect the reversal of million of this valuation allowance resulting from the renegotiation of the terms of a number of the optioned sites 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting pursuant to the statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities issued by the accounting standards executive committee  effective january   we changed our method of accounting for compensation and other training related costs incurred prior to the opening of a property to expense them as they are incurred 
accordingly  in we recorded an expense of  net of income tax benefit of  as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting

the decline in the average occupancy rate for properties open for at least one year at the beginning of each year is primarily attributable to an increase during those periods in the supply of available rooms in the lodging industry generally and specifically in certain of the markets particularly in certain markets in texas and north carolina in which we operate 
the impact of the additional supply of available rooms was offset by the impact of a decline in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties for each of our brands  resulting in overall average occupancy rates of for compared to for the increase in overall average weekly room rates for as compared to reflects the geographic dispersion of properties opened during and the higher standard weekly room rates in certain of those markets 
the increase also is due in part to increases in rates charged at previously opened properties 
the average weekly room rate for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods increased by in the increase in our overall average weekly room rates for as compared to is diluted by an increase in the percentage of total occupied rooms attributable to the lower priced crossland brand 
occupied rooms attributable to the crossland brand were of total occupied room nights for compared to for the decrease in the average weekly room rate for the studioplus brand is primarily the result of lower rates experienced in certain markets in texas and north carolina in response to an increase in the supply of available rooms in those markets

liquidity and capital resources we had net cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million as of december  at december  we had approximately million invested and at december  we had approximately  invested in short term demand notes having credit ratings of a pl or equivalent using domestic commercial banks and other financial institutions 
we also deposited excess funds during these periods in an overnight sweep account with a commercial bank which in turn invested those funds in short term  interest bearing reverse repurchase agreements 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we did not take possession of the securities  which were instead held by the financial institutions 
the market value of the securities held pursuant to these arrangements approximates the carrying amount 
deposits in excess of  are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
our operating activities generated cash of million in  million in  and million in we used million to acquire land and develop and furnish sites opened or under construction in  million for sites in  and million for sites in our cost to develop a property varies significantly by brand and by geographic location due to differences in land and labor costs 
similarly  the average weekly rate charged and the resultant cash flow from these properties will vary significantly but generally are expected to be in proportion to the development costs 
for the properties we opened from january  through december   the average development cost was approximately million with an average of rooms 
however  during we opened a number of properties in the northeast and west where average development costs are higher 
accordingly  our average development cost for was million per property 
we plan to continue to develop properties in the northeast and west and expect average development costs to increase to approximately million per property in we received net proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock totaling million in  million in  and million in we made open market repurchases of  shares of common stock for approximately million in   shares of common stock for approximately million in and  shares of common stock for approximately million in we have an agreement with various banks establishing a credit facility that provides for revolving loans and term loans on a senior collaterlized basis to be used for general corporate purposes  including the construction and acquisition of extended stay properties 
the credit facility was amended and restated in june and became the credit facility 
loans under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either a prime based rate or a libor based rate plus an applicable margin 
the table below illustrates the amounts committed under the credit facility and the interest on loans made under the credit facility 
applicable margin over description total amount prime libor maturity revolving facility million december  tranche a facility term loan million december  tranche b facility term loan million december  tranche c facility term loan million december  tranche d facility term loan million june  as of december   we had outstanding loans of million under the revolving facility and million  net of scheduled principal repayments  under the term loans  leaving million available and committed under the credit facility 
availability of the revolving facility is dependent  however  upon us satisfying certain financial ratios of debt and interest compared to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  with these amounts being calculated pursuant to definitions contained in the credit facility 
the loans under the credit facility mature on the dates set forth in the table above  but are subject to principal payments of of the initial loan amounts in each of the years through for the tranche b facility  through for the tranche c facility and through for the tranche d facility 
the remaining balances for each facility must be repaid in four equal quarterly installments in the year prior to maturity 
our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility is also collateralized by a first priority lien on all stock of our subsidiaries and all other current and future assets owned by us and our subsidiaries other than mortgages on our real property 
the credit facility contains a number of negative covenants  including  among others  covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  make investments  pay dividends  prepay other indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  make capital expenditures  acquire or dispose of assets  or engage in mergers or acquisitions 
in addition  the credit facility contains affirmative covenants  including  among others  covenants that require us to maintain our corporate existence  comply with laws  maintain our properties and insurance  and deliver financial and other information to the lenders 
the credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis 
our primary market risk exposures result from the variable nature of the interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility 
we entered into the credit facility for purposes other than trading 
based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility at december   if interest rates changed by  our annual cash flow and net income would change by million 
we manage our market risk exposures by periodic evaluation of such exposures relative to the costs of reducing the exposures by entering into interest rate contracts or by refinancing the underlying obligations with longer term fixed rate debt obligations 
we do not own derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments other than interest rate cap contracts on a total of million that limit our exposure to libor increases to a maximum libor rate of from june  through june  and to a maximum libor rate of from june  through june  in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semiannually on march and september of each year and mature on march  we may redeem the notes beginning on march  the initial redemption price is of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the redemption price declines each year after and is of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  after in addition  before march   we may redeem up to million of the notes  using the proceeds from certain sales of our stock  at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the notes are uncollateralized and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness including the credit facility  and contain certain covenants for the benefit of the holders of the notes 
these covenants  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make investments and other restricted payments  enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates  create liens  and sell assets 
in connection with the credit facility and the notes  we incurred additions to deferred loan costs of million during   during  and million during we plan to develop approximately properties with total costs of approximately million in we will seek to increase our annual investment in extended stay properties to million for we had commitments not reflected in our financial statements at december  totaling approximately million to complete construction of extended stay properties 
we believe that the remaining availability under the credit facility  together with cash on hand and cash flows from operations  will provide sufficient funds to continue our expansion as presently planned and to fund our operating expenses through we may need additional capital depending on a number of factors  including the number of properties we construct or acquire  the timing of that development  the cash flow generated by our properties and the amount of open market repurchases we make of our common stock 
also  if capital markets provide favorable opportunities  our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  our existing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund our growth and operations  or if we consummate acquisitions  we may seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
in the event we obtain additional capital  we may seek to increase property openings in future years 
sources of capital may include public or private debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure to raise additional capital could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of our development and expansion plans  and could have a material adverse effect on us 
new accounting releases in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was amended in june by sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires all derivatives to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december  at december   the carrying value of our interest rate cap contracts was  and their fair value was zero 
effective january   the company designated its interest rate cap contracts as cash flow hedges and will record an expense of  net of income tax benefit of  as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting 
seasonality and inflation based upon the operating history of our facilities  we believe that extended stay lodging facilities are not as seasonal in nature as the overall lodging industry 
we do expect  however  that our occupancy rates and revenues will be lower than average during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
because many of our expenses do not fluctuate with changes in occupancy rates  declines in occupancy rates may cause fluctuations or decreases in our quarterly earnings 
the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on our revenue or operating results during any of the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that inflation will not affect our future operating or construction costs
