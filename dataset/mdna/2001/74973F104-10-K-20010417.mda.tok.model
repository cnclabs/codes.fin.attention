item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  implement and manage industry specific private networks for businesses to communicate with their vendors and customers via bi directional satellite delivered internet connections 
our core services and products include remote high speed internet access  data delivery  high quality video  and networking services which can allow businesses to provide e business services  such as merchant payment  in store audio and video  employee benefits administration  employee training  and related services to their vendors and customers 
our solution utilizes always on satellite technology which delivers technology tools and applications to small and medium sized business entities 
we customize our managed browser technology rvista for each network to allow internet access  in an industry specific managed desktop environment  for conducting business transactions or viewing web based content and training  and providing e business services 
we expect to generate revenues by charging end users for internet access and other services  and by charging suppliers for the dedicated connection  e commerce services and advertising access to their customers 
in october  we announced that we were shifting all of our business focus and resources to pursue our current business  which business we initiated in july prior to that announcement  our principal focus was on building an advertiser supported network serving the education market 
operations commenced in september and we began offering sponsorships through our proprietary network in december over the next two years  we built one of the largest broadband networks dedicated to education in the united states 
this network was designed primarily for students aged to provide a rich media computer experience that was free to schools and easy to use 
we provided each school participating in the network from to multimedia personal computers with monitors  a satellite ready server  a laser printer and satellite based broadband access to the internet 
in addition  we offered a proprietary  easy to use browser interface providing access to the internet  over  pre selected and indexed third party educational web sites  educational tools  and other aggregated content and services 
since commencement of operations  our advertising based revenue model for the educational market was targeted by federal and state legislative initiatives supported by persons seeking to minimize advertising in schools 
in october  as a result of these initiatives  the negative publicity generated by persons opposed to advertising and gathering demographic information in schools  increasing expenses associated with the maintenance and servicing of our school network  and our uncertainty regarding future sponsorship revenues  we decided that we would no longer deliver paid commercial messages directed at students  would end the advertised supported business model and would discontinue the installation of free computer labs in schools 
these education business operations  including the operations of our efundraising subsidiary  which comprised all of our revenues and a significant portion of our assets and expenses  are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued 
we expect to dispose of our education network through a bulk sale of the assets and operations 
unless otherwise noted  all references to customers and clients relate to our current business operations and not the discontinued education business 
in connection with our change in business focus  we have undergone two significant reductions in force one in october of and another in march of these actions  combined with attrition  have reduced our us headcount approximately from our peak of employees in september to employees 
total severance costs associated with these actions equaled approximately million in additionally in october  in connection with our changed business strategy  our then chief executive officer  rick inatome  was made a consultant and our founder and chairman of the board  lance mortensen  was named chief executive officer 
revenue 
to date  we have generated no revenue from our continuing operations 
revenue from our school business  which comprised of our revenue  is not recorded because that business has been classified as discontinued 
rather  it has been applied as a reduction in what would otherwise be a larger loss from discontinued operations 
results from our discontinued operations are more fully described in the section labeled results of operations 
we expect to generate revenue from two principal sources end users of our industry specific networks and vendors to that community of users 
we believe that end users will pay a fee for broadband internet access  industry specific content and other bundled products and services while we believe vendors will pay for the right to occupy a priority position on a network in order to gain special access to those customers and to provide them an efficient means to distribute training  new product and other data  and vendors other services and products 
revenues from these sources will be recognized as the services are rendered 
in our discontinued operations we derived revenue from sponsorship of our education network 
sponsorship revenue consisted of fees charged for messages delivered over our network 
revenue related to sponsorship of content on our network was generally recognized over the time periods that the sponsorship was provided  unless such sponsorship was based on delivery of a minimum number of impressions  in which case revenue was recognized as the impressions are delivered 
advertising revenue was recognized in the period in which the advertisement message was displayed on the network  provided that no material obligations remained and collection of the related account receivable was reasonably certain 
network services and other revenue consisted of revenue from the distribution of content and products which were delivered through our network  and from educational services delivered in our labs such as teacher training  tutoring and other educational programs offered on our education network 
cost of revenues 
cost of services for our current network business was inconsequential in and prior periods due to the fact that virtually all such services were devoted to discontinued operations 
these expenses  therefore  are a component of the loss from discontinued operations 
we anticipate that upon maturation of our continuing operations  cost of services will consist primarily of depreciation on network equipment  including computers placed at user sites  and to a lesser degree  the cost of administering our satellite communications network 
the costs associated with this form of telecommunication include the cost of land based equipment  or earth segment  such as the satellite dishes  hubs  send receive cards located inside the network servers and land based phone service and the cost of the link to and from the satellite  or space segment 
we expect to provide much of our earth segment to customers by purchasing or renting satellite dishes  hubs and send receive cards for our network servers 
we expect to purchase the space segment from spacenet  a wholly owned subsidiary of gilat 
our cost of services will vary based on the number of locations we serve within our networks 
cost of revenues in our discontinued operations consisted primarily of depreciation of network equipment and computers placed in schools  allowances for the cost of equipment replacement not covered by manufacturers warranties  and the cost of operating our satellite communications network 
we provided much of our earth segment to schools by purchasing satellite dishes  hubs and send receive cards for our network servers 
we purchased space segment from ge americom  a unit of general electric corporation  and from spacenet  pursuant to fixed price agreements 
commencing july  spacenet began to install and lease computer equipment as well as provide the space segment under a long term fixed price per school contract 
operating expenses 
we believe our operating expenses from continuing operations will consist primarily of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses will consist primarily of compensation and consulting expenses associated with the further development and refinement of our proprietary managed browser technology  our satellite network  content and quality assurance 
to date  we have not capitalized any software development costs under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
because we believe that our process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility 
as a result  all development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses will consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel expenses  advertising expenses  costs of promotional programs  trade show expenses  seminars and costs of marketing materials 
general and administrative expenses will consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel  support services  facilities costs and professional service fees 
our operating expenses in our discontinued operations consisted primarily of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in we recorded  of amortization of deferred compensation relating to our continuing operations 
amortization of deferred compensation relating to personnel operating the discontinued education business in amounted to  and such expense was included in the loss from discontinued operations figures in that year 
in and  all amortization of deferred compensation related to personnel operating the discontinued education business and totaled  and  respectively 
these expenses are included in the discontinued operations  net of taxes line item in the financial statements 
during  we expect to record deferred stock compensation of  resulting from stock options granted and shares of common stock sold to our officers at prices below the deemed fair market value at the date of grant 
deferred stock compensation will be amortized over the vesting period of the options  generally to years from the date of grant  or the performance period for various warrants we granted using a graded vesting method 
all deferred compensation expense as of december  will be amortized over the next months 
we believe that future amortization expense will approximate  and  for and  respectively 
income taxes 
there has been no provision for federal or state income taxes for any period since inception due to our net operating losses 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which will expire beginning in fiscal year if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state tax code provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
management has established a valuation allowance and  accordingly  no benefit has been recognized for our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
the net valuation allowance increased by approximately million during the year ended december  we believe that  based on a number of factors  the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
these factors include our history of net losses since inception and expected near term future losses 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and forecasted operating results 
net loss applicable to common stockholders 
we recorded cash dividends paid to shareholders of series a preferred shares in a wholly owned subsidiary amounting to  for the year ended december  we recorded a dividend on our convertible preferred stock of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately  for the months ended december  additionally  we recorded in million for the beneficial conversion of our series e preferred stock upon its conversion into our common stock 
this amount represented the lesser of a the difference between the per share purchase price of our series e convertible preferred stock and the deemed fair value based upon an initial public offering of per share and b the offering proceeds 
acquisitions 
we completed two acquisitions during the second quarter of efundraising and learninggate 
com  inc learninggate 
each acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under accounting principles boards apb opinion no 
results of operations for each acquired company have been included in the loss from discontinued operations as each are part of the school business we have discontinued 
on may   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of efundraising  a company that offers fundraising products and services principally to schools  for total consideration of  comprised of  in cash and  in preferred stock in a subsidiary 
additionally  as contingent consideration  we issued time accelerated restricted stock award plan stock options tarsaps that  if certain financial and other milestones are met  entitle the holder to up to approximately  shares of our common stock 
no contingent consideration had been recorded as of december  as none had yet been earned 
on june   we completed our acquisition of learninggate  a provider of web based educational tools 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in addition to  cash to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the corporation 
this combination of cash and securities was then valued at  our subsidiaries  efundraising and learninggate  were acquired to complement our school operations and are now treated as part of our discontinued school business 
in connection with our withdrawal from the school business  we recorded a million charge on december  to reflect a the impairment in goodwill associated with efundraising and learninggate  b reserves for estimated operating losses while being held for sale and c expected transaction costs 
of that amount  million was attributable to the impairment of goodwill associated with efundraising  million was attributable to goodwill associated with learninggate and  was associated with estimated future operating losses and transaction costs connected with the possible sale of efundraising 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended december   prior to discontinuance totaled  consisting of  and  for efundraising and learninggate  respectively 
the assets of learninggate have been fully written off 
results of operations our discontinued education operations are comprised of all the assets  liabilities not expected to be assumed by a third party  revenues and expenses associated with our advertiser supported network serving the education market and our efundraising subsidiary that is in the business of selling fundraising tools to schools and other organizations 
we believe that  due to the majority of our operations being deemed discontinued  period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risk  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have an unproven business model and a limited operating history 
revenues in and prior years  there were no revenues from our continuing operations 
all revenues in and prior years were attributable to our discontinued education business operations 
total revenues from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  were million versus million in there were no revenues in the increase in revenues in was principally due to the significantly larger school network deployed in that year versus of the total revenue  million and million in and  respectively  were principally from sponsors inacom  toshiba  gilat  dell and sylvan affiliated with us either as shareholders or vendors 
cost of revenues in and prior years there were no costs of revenues from continuing operations 
all such costs were attributable to our discontinued education business operations 
cost of revenues from our discontinued education business operations increased in to million from million and  in and  respectively 
the increases from to and from to were due primarily to depreciation related to computer equipment installed in significantly more schools  space segment costs related to operating a significantly larger base of installed schools and call center costs to support a rapidly growing user base 
additionally  in we expensed million associated with earlier technology satellite cards deemed worthless 
research and development research and development expenses for our continuing operations in were  representing costs of personnel and overhead associated with initiating our new industry specific private network business 
in prior years all research and development expenses were attributable to our discontinued education business operations 
research and development expenses from our discontinued education business operations increased to approximately million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase from to was a result of increased payroll and consulting fees incurred in support of a rapid development of our network capabilities 
the increase from to was primarily due to increased research and development headcount 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for continuing operations were  in  representing costs of personnel and overhead associated with initiating our new industry specific private network business 
in prior years all sales and marketing expenses were attributable to our discontinued education business operations 
sales and marketing expenses for our discontinued education business operations increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in both instances were due to the increased number of sales and marketing personnel  related overhead  increased commissions and increased travel costs associated with the our direct selling efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses in were  representing costs of personnel and overhead associated with initiating our new industry specific private network business and transaction cost associated with the gilat tender offer 
in and  the only general and administrative expense attributable to our continuing business operations was depreciation on continuing corporate equipment and fixtures which amounted to  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses from our discontinued education business operations increased to million from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases were due to increased personnel and related overhead necessary to support the increased scale of our operations 
additionally  in  we incurred severance expenses of million in connection with a reduction in force prompted by our plan to exit the school business 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred compensation in was  relating to personnel associated with initiating our new industry specific private network business 
in and all amortization of deferred compensation  amounting to  and  respectively  was attributable to personnel who were dedicated to operating the discontinued education business 
amortization of deferred stock compensation from our discontinued operations for the year was  made up of  in research and development   in sales and marketing and  in general and administrative expense 
the increase in expense from to was principally due to incentive grants of stock or options at less than fair market value prices to a number of senior executives 
the decline in expense in was largely due to the gradual expiration of the amortization periods of earlier grants and the departure of several executives who are benficiaries 
no grants that would generate deferred compensation were made in interest income and expense interest income totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the growth in income was due to rising cost balances available for investment  largely by virtue of our initial public offering 
interest expense totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in expense was associated with capital leases entered into to finance the expansion of our school network 
liquidity and capital resources on november  we repurchased for million in cash all of the series a preferred stock of efundraising issued in connection with the acquisition of efundraising 
this repurchase was mandated by provisions of the series a preferred stock triggered by the october tender offer for of our common stock by gilat 
we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months based on our current business plan 
however  if by acquisition or other means opportunities are presented to deploy our products and services more rapidly than currently planned  we may seek to raise additional funds 
additionally  we may require additional capital to develop new satellite based private networks  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary technologies  or respond to unanticipated developments 
we may seek to raise additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic financial and business relationships  bank debt  lease financing  or otherwise 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of rstar owned by existing stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  and these equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to deploy or enhance our network  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated developments  which could severely harm our business 
additionally  the process of exiting from our education businesses will most likely involve the sale of the computer and other equipment now residing in schools 
most of this equipment is leased under capital leases whose terms may require prepayment upon sale of the equipment 
the lessor under the majority of these capital leases is our affiliate and owner  gilat 
the total lease obligation from unaffiliated lessors at december  was million 
factors affecting our business  operating results and financial condition investors should carefully consider the risks desribed below before making an investment decision 
we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and other notes 
we have an unproven business model and a limited operating history 
because we have discontinued our principal business building an advertiser supported network serving the education market and we have not completed the development of our industry specific private network business  we have a limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our revenue and income potential are unproven and our business model is unique and evolving 
we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
an investor in our common stock must carefully consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  as well as the risks we face due to our participation in a new and rapidly evolving market 
our business strategy may not be successful and it may not successfully overcome these risks 
our business model is changing and future revenue growth will suffer if we fail to attract and grow our sponsorship and user base 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to generate revenue by attracting sponsors and subscribers for the industry specific private networks we seek to develop and deploy 
if we are unable to rapidly deploy our networks to a large number of fee based business customers  our ability to generate revenue and implement our strategy will be severely limited 
users may find that our networks features and content are not sufficiently compelling to continue regular use  or may turn to other internet providers for such services such as broadband internet connectivity  software applications  industry specific content  and e commerce business solutions 
if we are not able to demonstrate to sponsors that our networks have an active and growing user base  sponsors may choose not to enter into sponsorship agreements with us and our revenues generated from sponsorships would suffer 
we have incurred substantial losses and anticipate continued losses 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the period of inception through december   which losses resulted primarily from costs related to developing our discontinued education network business  deploying the network to schools and developing content and features for the network 
we have not achieved profitability 
we expect to have increasing net losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future 
the size of these net losses will depend  in part  on revenues from our sponsors and subscribers of the industry specific private networks we intend to provide  and on the level of our expenses 
as a result  management expects that our operating expenses will continue to grow for the foreseeable future 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
it is possible that we will never achieve profitability  and even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if we do not achieve or sustain profitability in the future  then we may be unable to continue our operations 
we expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate and our recent shift to our current business limits management s ability to predict revenues and expenses precisely 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include the factors described in the subheadings below 
to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could impact our quarterly operating results 
most of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels in connection with our current business 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below our expectations we may not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter 
this revenue shortfall might then have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter 
consequently  management believes that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and should not be viewed as indicators of our future performance in connection with our current business 
in addition  during future periods our quarterly or annual operating results may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this case the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 
gilat owns of our outstanding common stock and may delay or impede certain proposed transactions by  or a change in control of  rstar 
on january   gilat successfully completed a tender offer for certain of our shares of common stock and became the holder of of our then outstanding common stock 
as a result  gilat may be deemed to have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for action  including the election of members of our board of directors and the approval of any significant transactions 
gilat s ownership of more than a majority equity interest in rstar may make certain transactions proposed by our management more difficult to effect absent gilat s support  and may have the effect of delaying or preventing any proposed change in control of rstar 
nasdaq has sent a notice regarding our failure to maintain a minimum bid price and our efforts to remain listed on the nasdaq national market may lower the value of our common stock 
on march  we received a notice from nasdaq that our common stock had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of over the preceding consecutive trading days as required for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
the notice stated that if at any time prior to june   the closing bid price of our common stock does not sustain at or more for at least consecutive trading days  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock fails to sustain the minimum closing bid price for the requisite number of days  the nasdaq staff will issue a determination that the common stock will be delisted 
thereafter  and prior to any actual delisting  we will have an opportunity to request a hearing 
at such hearing  we will have the ability to present a plan demonstrating that we can come into compliance with the continued listing requirements 
a common course of action for companies attempting to maintain their listing by ensuring a bid price in excess of is the institution of a reverse stock split 
at present  we have made no decision with respect to this course of action but will continue to evaluate this alternative in light of all other options  including accepting a delisting determination 
a reverse stock split could negatively impact the value of the our stock by allowing additional downward pressure on the stock price as our relative value becomes greater following the reverse split 
that is to say  the stock  at our new  higher price per share has farther to fall and therefore more room for investors to short or otherwise trade the value of the stock downward 
our shares of common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which would impair their liquidity 
our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  either for failure to maintain a minimum bid price  or because  among other things  the number of shares of our common stock that are publicly held falls below  the number of holders of round lot shares of our common stock falls below  or the market value of such publicly held shares is not at least million 
the closing bid price of our common stock has not been above for consecutive trading days since november if our shares of common stock are delisted from the nasdaq national market  their liquidity will be impaired 
though we may decide to seek trading of our common stock on the over the counter bulletin board  or otc market  if our common stock is delisted  the otc market provides substantially less liquidity than the nasdaq national market  and stocks traded on the otc market generally trade with larger spreads between the bid and the ask price  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
also  if we decide to seek trading of our common stock on the otc market  our common stock would be subject to rules under the securities exchange act of  which imposes additional requirements on broker dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and to persons other than accredited investors 
in this context the term accredited investors includes individuals with a net worth in excess of  or an annual income exceeding  or  together with their spouses 
for transactions covered by such rules  a broker dealer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must have received the purchaser s written consent prior to the sale 
this could negatively affect the ability of broker dealers to sell shares of our common stock and further impair the liquidity of our common stock 
if delisted  our shares of common stock may be characterized as penny stocks  which may severely harm their liquidity 
the sec has adopted regulations which define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than per share or with an exercise price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
for any transaction involving a penny stock  unless exempt  these rules require delivery  prior to any transaction in a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule relating to the penny stock market 
disclosure is also required to be made about current quotations for the securities and about commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative 
finally  broker dealers must send monthly statements to purchasers of penny stocks disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks 
the foregoing penny stock restrictions will not apply to our shares of common stock if they continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market  certain price and volume information is publicly available about our shares on a current and continuing basis  and we meet certain minimum net tangible assets or average revenue criteria 
our common stock may not qualify for an exemption from the penny stock restrictions 
if our shares of common stock were subject to the rules on penny stocks  the liquidity of our common stock would be severely harmed 
our methods of generating revenues are new and largely untested 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to generate revenue 
prior to discontinuing our education business  we generated of our revenues from that business 
we have not yet begun to generate any revenue from our new business  and because our methods of generating revenue are new and largely untested we may generate lower revenues than we expect 
further  if we are unable to generate multiple new sources of revenue  our future revenue growth will suffer 
currently  we expect to receive the majority of our revenue from suppliers to participants in industries for which we plan to provide private networks  who will be charged for dedicated connections  and for e commerce and advertising access to their customers  network services  including marketing and profit sharing fees  and fees paid by network end users 
the success of our initiatives to become a leading provider of satellite based network services to specific industries depends in part on our ability to adapt our experience in building a satellite based network for our discontinued education business to other markets and those markets acceptance of our products and services  and more generally upon the adoption of the internet as a medium for commerce by a broad base of customers and our users 
if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than expected  or if our products and services do not achieve market acceptance  our revenue generated from our new network business will be lower than expected 
we rely heavily on our key partners and if they terminate their strategic alliances with us or if the arrangement fail to meet our objectives  we may experience difficulty or delays in installing and maintaining our planned networks and our revenue growth may suffer 
we rely heavily on our strategic alliance relationships with gilat and its wholly owned subsidiary  spacenet 
our agreements with gilat and spacenet involve many aspects of our business  including deployment and operation of our planned industry specific networks and these arrangements are complex and will require a great deal of effort to operate successfully 
as a result  there are many risks related to these arrangements  including some that we may not have foreseen 
it is difficult to assess the likelihood of occurrence of these risks  including the lack of success of the overall arrangements to meet the parties objectives 
if we fail to maintain these relationships  or if our partners do not perform to our expectations  the performance of our networks  and our ability to generate revenues  may be harmed 
we are dependent on third parties to deploy our planned networks to business enterprises and support it once installed 
we have used  and plan to continue to use  third parties such as gilat and spacenet to install and support our planned networks in business entities 
in the past we have experienced difficulties resulting from the failure of third parties to manage successfully the wide scale deployment of our discontinued education network in a school environment 
such failures  if duplicated in our new network business  would result in delays in the scheduled deployment of our networks and could limit or eliminate revenue generated from sponsorships  e commerce and network services 
we also rely on third parties to provide the majority of support necessary to maintain our networks once installed 
any inability to maintain or delays to the maintenance of this equipment would lead to lower revenue generated from sponsorships  e commerce and network services 
our varied sales cycles could harm our results of operations if forecasted sales are delayed or do not occur 
the length of time between the date of initial contact with a potential customer or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the potential customer or sponsor may vary significantly and may depend on the nature of the arrangement 
furthermore  contracting with potential sponsors is subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including potential sponsors adoption of our industry specific networks  which are a relatively new advertising medium  as an acceptable use of those sponsors budgets  potential sponsors or customers budgetary constraints  potential sponsors internal acceptance reviews  and the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by sponsors 
during any given sales cycle  we may expend substantial funds and management resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or subscriber revenue 
our results of operations for a particular period may suffer if sales to sponsors and subscribers forecasted in a particular period are delayed or do not otherwise occur 
government regulation affecting our business strategy could harm our business 
laws and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
these laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and the quality of products and services 
in addition  these new laws have not yet been significantly interpreted by the courts  and consequently their applicability and reach are not defined 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership  copyright  defamation  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain and developing 
we may be subject to claims that our services violate such laws 
any new legislation or regulation in the united states or abroad or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet could impose significant restrictions  requirements or additional costs on our business  require us to change our operating methods  business strategy  or subject us to additional liabilities and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we are dependent on our network infrastructure  and in particular on satellites and satellite transmission technology  and any failure of our networks would harm our operations 
we recently decided to withdraw from the education market and  instead  emphasize our goal of becoming a leading provider of satellite based private networks for specific industries 
our network infrastructure may not be able to support the demands this growth may place on it and our performance and reliability may decline 
we experienced interruptions in service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout our network infrastructure in our former education business  and we may in the future experience such interruptions in service and other delays 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  use of our planned networks and their growth could be impaired 
our network operations center and our communications and other computer hardware  are also subject to disruptions which are beyond our control and for which we may not have adequate insurance 
fire  floods  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage our communications hardware and other network operations 
our facilities in the state of california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event those blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could severely disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
each user of our planned networks will be connected to our networks through a satellite link 
the complete or partial loss of a satellite used to transmit data to network subscribers could affect the performance of our networks 
orbiting satellites are subject to the risk of failing prematurely due to mechanical failure  collision with objects in space or an inability to maintain proper orbit 
any such loss of the use of a satellite could prevent us from delivering our services 
this interruption in services would continue until either a substitute satellite is placed into orbit  or until our services are moved to a different satellite 
moving to an alternate satellite would require us to redirect all of the satellite dishes in our networks a very time consuming and expensive process 
the loss of a satellite could also result in increased costs of using satellites 
we are dependent on transmissions from the satellite to our customer sites  and these transmissions may be interrupted or experience other difficulty  which could result in service interruptions and delays in our networks 
in addition  the use of the satellite to provide transmissions to our customers requires a direct line of sight between the satellite and the receiver at the business site and is subject to distance and rain attenuation 
in markets that experience heavy rainfall we may need to use greater power to maintain transmission quality 
such changes may require federal communications commission  or fcc  approval  which may not be granted 
we may be subject to third party abuses of our networks  such as computer viruses  spam or hacking  which could lead to interruptions in our services and other adverse consequences which could be expensive to fix  subject us to liability or result in lower use of our networks than expected 
the future success of our business depends on the security of our planned networks 
computer viruses or problems caused by our users or other third parties  such as the sending of excessive volumes of unsolicited bulk e mail or spam  could lead to interruptions  delays  or cessation in service to our users 
in addition  the sending of spam through our networks could result in third parties asserting claims against us 
we may not prevail in such claims and our failure to do so could result in large judgments that would harm our business 
users or other third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems by their inappropriate use of the internet  including hacking  which could cause losses to us or our users or deter persons from using our services 
users or third parties may also potentially expose us to liability by identity theft  or posing as another network user 
unauthorized access by current and former employees or others could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and that of our users 
we expect that our users will increasingly use the internet for commercial transactions in the future 
any network malfunction or security breach could cause these transactions to be delayed  not completed at all  or completed with compromised security 
users or others may assert claims of liability against us as a result of any failure by us to prevent these network malfunctions and security breaches  and may deter others from using our services  which could cause our business prospects to suffer 
although we intend to continue using industry standard security measures  such measures have been circumvented in the past  and we cannot assure you that these measures will not be circumvented in the future 
in addition  to alleviate problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches  we may have to interrupt  delay  or cease service to our users  which could severely harm our business 
we are dependent on leased satellite bandwidth  and if such a lease is unavailable to us  we could be subjected to significant restrictions on our business 
we leased satellite bandwidth from spacenet for our discontinued education business 
if  for any reason  we are not able to negotiate a new lease with spacenet or another satellite provider on favorable terms  our new industry specific private network business could be significantly jeopardized  as it is bi directional satellite based 
the satellite industry is a highly regulated industry 
in the united states  operation and use of satellites requires licenses from the fcc 
as a lessee of satellite space  we could in the future be indirectly subject to new laws  policies or regulations or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies or regulations  any of which may modify the present regulatory environment in the united states 
while we believe that spacenet will be able to obtain all us licenses and authorizations necessary to operate effectively  it may not continue to be successful in doing so 
our failure to indirectly obtain some or all necessary licenses or approvals could impose significant additional costs and restrictions on our business  require us to change our operating methods  or result in us no longer being able to provide our service to affected users 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our current and potential competitors  then we may lose users to other services which could result in lower usage of our planned networks as well as lower than expected revenues 
the market for our industry specific private network products and services is new and rapidly evolving  and we expect competition in and around this market to intensify in the future 
while we do not believe any of our competitors currently offer the bundle of products and services we will offer  we face competition from a number of companies who provide services and functionality similar to portions of our services and functionality  who market products and services to a similar base of users  or both  and who could in the future seek to compete more directly with us 
for example  hughes electronics  currently offers one way satellite based broadband internet access to businesses  and it has an alliance with america online to promote america online s broadband services and content 
we therefore believe that our greatest potential competitive threat is posed not by a single company  but a combination of or more companies that each addresses different parts of our new business model 
many of our existing competitors for some of our products and services  as well as potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this may allow such competitors to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their products and services and to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to our potential subscribers  partners  sponsors and e commerce merchants 
many of these competitors may offer a wider range of products and services than we do  may attract sponsors and subscribers to our competitors products and services and  consequently  result in lower acceptance and usage of our private network products and services 
business enterprises may use alternative means to acquire computers  services  industry specific content  and internet access  which could reduce our potential user base and may lead to lower than expected revenues 
we believe an attraction of our business is the complete bundle of computer hardware  software  industry specific content and broadband internet connectivity we intend to offer 
however  for a variety of reasons  business enterprises may decide to use other methods to acquire computers  internet access and other services to meet their needs 
if business enterprises decide to use means other than deployment of our products and services  it will limit our user and sponsor base  and consequently we will have lower than expected revenues 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our operations when needed 
we expect to use our existing cash for general corporate purposes  including expanding our sales and marketing activities  continuing investments in technology and product development and other capital expenditures  as well as working capital and other corporate expenses  including the funding of net losses from operations 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  our cash requirements are large  and depend on several factors  including cash outflows due to lease obligations  the rate of expansion of our planned industry specific private networks  the cash recovered from the sale of our discontinued education business or the assets associated with that business  the availability of equipment leases on competitive terms  our success in generating revenues  the growth of sales and marketing efforts  and other factors 
if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to deploy our planned networks  develop or enhance our services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
we are dependent on growth in use and popularity of our networks and the internet by our users and our ability to successfully anticipate the frequently changing tastes of our users 
our business is unlikely to be successful if the popularity of the internet as a viable business tool does not continue to increase 
even if the popularity of the internet and related media does increase  the success of our planned industry specific private network in particular depends on our ability to anticipate and keep current with the frequently changing tastes of our users  primarily small and medium sized business enterprises in the industries we seek to serve 
any failure on our part to successfully anticipate  identify or react to changes in styles  trends or preferences of our users would lead to reduced interest in and use of our networks and therefore limit opportunities for sponsorship sales  subscriber fees and e commmerce revenues 
moreover  the rstar networks brand could be eroded by misjudgments in service offerings or a failure to keep our offerings  services and content current with the evolving preferences of the marketplace 
our efforts to develop widespread brand recognition are likely to be expensive and may fail 
the development of our brand is important to our future success 
if we fail to develop sufficient brand recognition  our ability to attract sponsorship and subscriber revenue may be impaired  and our revenue will suffer 
in order to build our brand awareness we must succeed in our brand marketing efforts  deliver features and services that are engaging to our users  and provide high quality content and services 
these efforts will continue require significant expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing our brand 
we may be subject to liability for services sold through our network 
to date  we have had very limited experience in enabling consumers to directly purchase products and services online or in the development of relationships with manufacturers or suppliers of such products and services 
however  we plan to develop a range of e commerce opportunities in connection with our industry specific private networks 
network users may sue us if the products or services sold online are defective  fail to perform properly or injure the user 
liability claims resulting from our sale of products could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
we may be subject to liability for publishing or distributing content over our network 
we may be subject to claims relating to content that is published on or downloaded from our planned industry specific private networks 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type  such as defamation or trademark infringement  or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any claims like this  with or without merit  could require us to change our networks in a manner that could be less attractive to our sponsors and subscribers and would result in the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel 
we may not be able to deliver various services if third parties fail to provide reliable software  systems and related services 
all of our sponsors advertisements will be served using software originally licensed from netgravity 
while there is other software available  it would substantially disrupt our business in the near term to switch to another provider 
as such  if we are not able to maintain such agreement or license or internally develop similar software in the future  we may not be able to effectively display advertisements to our users 
in such event  our revenue from sponsorships would likely suffer 
in addition we are dependent on various third parties for other software  systems and related services  including software that enables us to multicast data and software via satellite 
several of the third parties that provide software and services to us have a limited operating history  have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on reliable delivery of services from others 
as a result  our ability to deliver various services to our users may suffer due to the failure of these third parties to provide reliable software  systems and related services to us 
the inability to obtain key software from third parties may harm our business 
we rely on software licensed from third parties  including applications that are integrated with internally developed software and used in our products 
most notably  we license microsoft operating system software 
this and other third party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and we may not be able to obtain licenses for other existing or future technologies that we desire to integrate into our products 
our business could be seriously harmed if it cannot maintain existing third party technology licenses or enter into licenses for other existing or future technologies needed for our products 
our success depends upon the successful development of new services and features in the face of rapidly evolving technology 
the market for our current products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the recent growth of the internet and intense competition in our industry exacerbate these market characteristics 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our networks 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new features  content or network services 
in addition  our new enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective sponsors and subscribers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
we could also incur substantial costs if it needed to modify our service or infrastructures to adapt to these changes 
failure to manage the growth of our operations could harm our business and strain our managerial  operational and financial resources 
we have recently and significantly changed our business model and strategy 
we anticipate that future expansion will be required to build a sponsor and subscriber base if we are to be successful in implementing our business strategy 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business would suffer 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will be required to improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  install new management information systems  and train  motivate and manage our sales and marketing  engineering  technical and customer support employees 
the loss of key personnel may hurt our ability to operate our business effectively 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of the principal members of our sales  engineering and management departments  many of whom perform important management functions and would be difficult to replace 
specifically  management believes that our future success is highly dependent on our senior management  and in particular on lance mortensen  our chairman  chief executive officer and president 
the loss of the services of any key personnel  particularly senior management  could seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to retain and hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully achieve our objectives 
we have hired engineering  sales  marketing  customer support accounting and other personnel 
we may not be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  and we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to deploy our networks in a timely fashion or to support our users and operations 
we have at times experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
recruiting qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders and result in increased debt and assumption of contingent liabilities 
as part of our business strategy  we may consider acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the event of such future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities  which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  or assume contingent liabilities 
such actions by us could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies  products or personnel  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition that could materially adversely affect our results of operations  negative effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and of amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
possible infringement of intellectual property rights could harm our business 
we seek to protect our intellectual property and to respect the intellectual property rights of others 
to protect our own intellectual property  we rely on us and international law regarding copyright  patents  trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  contractors and business partners 
we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining  registering  policing or defeating challenges to our intellectual property rights  or that we will avoid claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  we may be unsuccessful in doing so 
we may be unable to obtain patents or register trademarks for a variety of reasons  including a mistaken belief that these items are eligible for intellectual property protection or that we are the entity entitled to this protection  if any 
our copyrights and trade secrets may similarly turn out to be ineligible for legal protection 
in addition  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our proprietary information despite  or in the absence of  a confidentiality agreement 
some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states  and intellectual property law in the united states is still uncertain and evolving as applied to internet related industries 
the status of domain names and the regulatory bodies in charge of them is also unsettled 
any inability to register or otherwise protect our intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business since it could enable competitors to copy important features on our network 
furthermore  third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us 
these claims  possibly including those from companies from which we license key technology for our operations  could result in significant liability  the inability to use key rights and technologies  and the invalidation of our own proprietary rights 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  any litigation could be time consuming  expensive  and distracting of management s time and attention 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the expense related to those debt instruments and credit facilities that are tied to market rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade and high credit quality securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not cause the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents or the interest expense paid with respect to our outstanding debt instruments to change by a material amount 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
as of december   we had not engaged in any significant foreign currency activity
