item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the consolidated financial statements set forth herein for each of the three years in the period ended december   reflect the results of operations of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries including sun world 
a summary of the sun world elements which management of the company believes is essential to an analysis of the results of operations for such periods is presented below 
for purposes of this summary  the term sun world will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to the operations and activities of the company s sun world subsidiary  and the term cadiz will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to those operations and activities of the company not involving sun world 
the company s net income or loss in future fiscal periods will be largely reflective of a the operations of the company s water development activities including the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program the cadiz program and b the operations of sun world 
sun world conducts its operations through four operating divisions farming  packing  marketing and proprietary product development 
net income from farming operations varies from year to year primarily due to yield and pricing fluctuations which can be significantly influenced by weather conditions  and are  therefore  generally subject to greater annual variation than sun world s other divisions 
however  the geographic distribution of sun world s farming operations within california and the diversity of its crop mix makes it unlikely that adverse weather conditions would affect all of sun world s properties or all of its crops in any single year 
nevertheless  net profit from sun world s packing  marketing and proprietary product development operations tends to be more consistent from year to year than net profit from sun world s farming operations 
packing and marketing revenues from third party growers currently represent less than ten percent of total company revenues 
sun world has entered into agreements internationally to license selected proprietary fruit varieties and continues to pursue additional domestic and international licensing opportunities 
license revenues also currently represent less than ten percent of total company revenues

outlook the company is actively pursuing the development of its water resources 
specifically  in july  the company and metropolitan approved the principles for a year agreement for the cadiz program 
the principles provide that metropolitan will  during wet years or periods of excess supply  store surplus water from its colorado river aqueduct in the groundwater basin underlying the company s property 
during dry years or times of reduced allocations from the colorado river  the previously imported water  together with additional existing groundwater  will be extracted and delivered  via a conveyance pipeline  back to the aqueduct 
subsequently  metropolitan  following extensive negotiations with the company to further refine and finalize the principles  submitted definitive economic terms and responsibilities definitive terms to its board of directors in march for anticipated consideration at a forthcoming board meeting 
until such consideration and action by both the company s and metropolitan s board  the proposed definitive terms will remain proposed and subject to change 
in addition  execution of a final agreement will be contingent upon and subject to completion of the ongoing environmental review process for the cadiz program 
key provisions of the proposed definitive terms are as follows over the year term of the agreement  metropolitan will store a minimum of  acre feet of colorado river aqueduct cra water in the company s groundwater basin and purchase up to a minimum of  acre feet of existing groundwater for transfer during dry years 
the cadiz program will have the capacity to convey  either for storage or transfer  up to approximately  acre feet in any given year 
during storage operations  metropolitan will pay per acre foot for put of colorado river water into storage and per acre foot for return of colorado river water from storage  or a total of acre feet to cycle water into and out of the basin 
these fees will be adjusted by cpi 
as outlined above  metropolitan s total minimum commitment for storage is  acre feet 
metropolitan will pay for the initial  acre feet of put and take activity upon final contract execution and completion of the environmental review million before cpi adjustment 
metropolitan will pay for an additional  acre feet of put and take activity at the earlier of actual usage or  acre feet annual increments during years of cadiz program operations  per year before cpi adjustment 
for transfer operations  metropolitan shall purchase  acre feet per year of indigenous groundwater for years at per acre foot transfer fee  subject to a fair market value adjustment as described below 
in addition  cadiz may elect to either sell up to an additional  acre feet per year of indigenous groundwater to third parties in metropolitan s service area at fair market value  or require metropolitan to purchase that amount of water at a fixed transfer fee of per acre foot 
accordingly  metropolitan s total potential minimum commitment for the life of the cadiz program will be  acre feet of indigenous groundwater 
all transfers of indigenous groundwater  whether to metropolitan or third parties  will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the management plan 
the transfer fee will reflect a fair market value adjustment  which shall be determined up to once a year 
the transfer fee will be adjusted by one half of any increase or decrease in the fair market value  above or below the base rate 
for example  if the fair market value is per acre foot  then the adjusted transfer fee shall be per acre foot 
each increase or decrease in the transfer fee paid by metropolitan may not exceed cadiz right to sell to third parties within metropolitan s service area includes scheduled access to metropolitan s system at the wheeling rate charged for as available capacity  plus power costs and any standard water stewardship fee that is uniformly charged to metropolitan member agencies or third parties 
depending on availability of system capacity  metropolitan may elect to exchange other water for delivery to cadiz customers and bank the water cadiz has sold 
if indigenous water supplies are determined to exceed  acre feet  metropolitan shall have the first right of refusal to purchase one half of that excess yield 
cadiz groundwater meets all existing federal and state water quality standards 
metropolitan s cra water meets all existing federal and state water quality standards 
metropolitan shall be responsible to ensure  at its expense  that cra water introduced into the cadiz groundwater basin shall  at a minimum  meet all existing and potential future federal and state water quality standards applicable to the cra 
cadiz shall be responsible to ensure  at its expense  that indigenous groundwater introduced into the metropolitan delivery system shall at a minimum  meet all existing and potential future federal and state water quality standards 
if both indigenous groundwater and stored colorado river water exceed any future federal or state water quality standard  then the parties will share compliance with the new standard based pro rata on the contribution to exceeding the standard 
the cadiz program facilities  including spreading basins  extraction wells  conveyance pipeline and a pumping plant are estimated to cost between and million  and both parties will equally share these costs 
each party will be responsible for financing its portion of the capital costs 
metropolitan will be responsible for operational costs of the cadiz program 
however  cadiz will assume pro rata operational costs associated with the sale of indigenous groundwater to third parties 
metropolitan and cadiz shall share equally the capital costs required for mitigation at outset of the cadiz program 
cadiz shall assume remaining mitigation costs  including the ongoing annual cost of operating the management plan 
in addition to the development of its water resources  the company is actively involved in further agricultural development and reinvestment in its landholdings 
such development will be systematic and in furtherance of the company s business strategy to provide for maximization of the value of its assets 
the company also continually evaluates acquisition opportunities that are complimentary to its current portfolio of water and agricultural resources 
sun world currently services its indebtedness and meets its seasonal working capital needs utilizing available internal cash  the sun world revolver and  if necessary  through an intercompany revolver with cadiz 
cadiz currently meets its ordinary working capital needs through a combination of available internal cash  quarterly management fee payments from sun world  payments from sun world under an agricultural lease whereby sun world now operates the company s  acres of developed agricultural property at cadiz  california  the exercise of outstanding stock options  and through an intercompany revolver with sun world 
except for the foregoing  additional intercompany cash payments between sun world and cadiz are subject to certain restrictions under its current lending arrangements 
in the event the company requires additional cash beyond the foregoing to meet its working capital needs  the company believes that additional debt and or equity can be issued as needed for this purpose 
certain trends and uncertainties in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
the company wishes to caution readers that these factors  among others  could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any projected  estimated or forward looking statements relating to the company 
the following factors should be considered in conjunction with any discussion of operations or results by the company or its representatives  including any forward looking discussion  as well as comments contained in press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  or other communications by the company 
in making these statements  the company is not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding the company s business or results  and is not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes to discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  certain of these matters may have affected the company s past results and may affect future results 
risks inherent in agricultural operations 
the company is subject to risks associated with its agricultural operations 
numerous factors can affect the price  yield and marketability of the crops grown on the company s properties 
crop prices may vary greatly from year to year as a result of the relationship between production and market demand 
for example  the production of a particular crop in excess of demand in any particular year will depress market prices  and inflationary factors and other unforeseeable economic changes may also  at the same time  increase operating costs with respect to such crops 
in addition  the agricultural industry in the united states is highly competitive  and domestic growers and produce marketers are facing increased competition from abroad  particularly from mexico 
there are also a number of factors outside of the company s control that could  alone or in combination  materially adversely affect the company s agricultural operations  such as adverse weather conditions  insects  blight or other diseases  labor problems such as boycotts or strikes and shortages of competent laborers 
the company s operations may also be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies  social and economic conditions  and industry production levels 
risks of water development projects 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating losses from its non sun world operations until such time as it is able to receive significant revenues from the development of its water development projects  including the cadiz program 
in addition to the risks associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits with respect to the company s water development projects  the company may also encounter unforeseen technical difficulties  which could result in construction delays  and cost increases or determination that a project is not feasible 
the company is continuing to negotiate the terms and conditions of water storage and supply programs with various california water agencies including metropolitan with respect to preparing the final agreement for the cadiz program 
however  the outcome of these negotiations cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
the circumstances under which transfers or storage of water can be made and the profitability of any transfers or storage are subject to significant uncertainties  including hydrologic risks of variable water supplies  risks presented by allocations of water under existing and prospective priorities  and risks of adverse changes to or interpretations of us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies 
other important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the company or on behalf of the company are discussed elsewhere within this form k in the sections entitled seasonality  regulation  competition  and liquidity and capital resources
