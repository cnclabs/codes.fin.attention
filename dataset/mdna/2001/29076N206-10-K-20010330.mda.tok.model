we are planning to begin commercial manufacturing and distribution of our products and technology as components to oem system manufacturers for near eye and headset applications in products such as entertainment and gaming headsets  handheld internet and telecommunication appliances  and wearable computers 
emagin corporation was originally incorporated as fashion dynamics corporation on january  under the laws of the state of nevada 
for the three years prior to the merger  fashion dynamics corporation had no active business operations  and sought to acquire an interest in a business with long term growth potential 
on march   fashion dynamics corporation acquired fed corporation derived from field emissive device  subsequently changed its name to emagin corporation derived from electronic imaging and listed its common stock on the american stock exchange under the ema trading symbol 
under the terms of the merger  fashion dynamics corporation issued approximately million shares of its common stock to fed corporation shareholders and issued approximately million options and warrants in exchange for existing fed options and warrants 
the total purchase price of the transaction was approximately million  including million of value relating to the shares issued at a fair value of per share  the value of a simultaneous private placement transaction of similar securities  million of value relating to the options and warrants exchanged and million of assumed liabilities 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition as determined by an independent appraisal 
the purchase price was allocated as follows in millions deferred compensation in process research and development fixed assets other intangible assets goodwill we amortize goodwill and other intangible assets acquired over their estimated useful lives of three years 
we recorded approximately million in amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets for the year ended december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 amounts assigned to in process research and development are to be charged to expense as part of the allocation of purchase price 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development related to projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that  until completion of development  had no alternative future use 
these projects require substantial development and testing prior to reaching technological feasibility and may not develop into products that may be sold by us 
for the three years prior to the acquisition of fed corporation  fashion dynamics corporation had no active business operations 
management believes that the comparison of emagin s financial results to that of the operating entity fed corporation provides the most meaningful comparative information to the reader 
accordingly  the following comparative information reflects the operating results of fed corporation for all periods prior to the merger and it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of this prospectus 
the comparison of financial information below for the period ended december  reflects pro forma results of emagin for the period january  through december  and its predecessor fed corporation for the period january  to march   on a combined basis  such that the amounts presented and discussed reflect the full year of operations for each period 
reference is made to our consolidated financial statements that are included herein for further detail on the results of emagin and fed corporation for their respective periods of ownership 
our history has been as a developmental stage company 
we intend to significantly increase our marketing  sales  and research and development efforts  and expand our operating infrastructure 
most of our operating expenses will be fixed in the near term 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues  our net losses in any given quarter could be greater than expected 
as a result  you should consider our prospects in light of the early stage of our business in a new and rapidly evolving market 
the following are descriptions of the revenue and expense components of our statement of operations net contract revenues currently represent revenues mostly from contracts funded by us government programs 
we have historically earned revenues from certain of our research and development activities under both fixed price contracts and cost type contracts  including some cost plus fee contracts 
revenues relating to fixed price contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as costs are incurred cost to cost basis 
revenues on cost plus fee contracts include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profit based on the relationship of costs and the allocation of allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract 
the amount of revenues earned is dependent upon the execution of new government contracts  which may not be predictable or consistent from period to period because of variations in government funds allocated to research and development in our field of technology 
research and development expenses represent salaries  development materials  external contracts  equipment lease and depreciation expense  electronics  rent  utilities and costs associated with operating our manufacturing facility 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we have received cost sharing awards from certain us government agencies to fund certain research and development 
funding from this type of contract is recognized as a reduction in research and development operating expenses during the period in which the services are performed and related direct expenses are incurred 
as of december   the remaining amounts to be incurred and billed on these active cost sharing contracts totaled million 
non cash stock based compensation expense represents expenses associated with stock option grants to our officers and employees at below fair market value as additional compensation for their services and to induce them to lock up their options for a longer time then would normally be specified under the company s standard option grant 
deferred compensation is amortized over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options 
the expense also represents warrant grants with exercise prices below fair market value to security holders of emagin for a reduced number of warrants to induce them to lock up prior to the merger 
amortization of purchased intangibles represents the cost of amortization of the value of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the purchased intangibles are amortized over their expected useful lives of three years on a straight line basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses principally represent the cost of salaries and fees for professional services  legal fees incurred in connection with patent filings and related matters  depreciation and amortization  and other administrative expenses as well as expenses associated with marketing 
basic and diluted net loss per common share is computed by using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period  restated for the effect of the merger upon the number of shares outstanding in the current year  and for the presentation of the net loss per share for the predecessor  a stock split effected during no common stock equivalents have been included in the computation of weighted average shares outstanding  as their effect would be anti dilutive 
results of operations comparison of our financial results for the years ended december   and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
this increase was due primarily to the recognition of revenue from certain government contracts relating to head wearable displays 
research and development expenses gross research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   representing a increase 
of these amounts  we received million in cost sharing from the us government for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the million increase in gross expenses for the year ended december  reflects the additional costs associated with personnel costs  equipment leases  depreciation  and material costs resulting from increased research and development activities and equipment additions at our manufacturing facility 
non cash stock based compensation expense non cash stock based compensation expense was million for the year ended december  versus no activity for the year ended december  the activity  for the year ended december   reflects the amortization of deferred compensation costs related to the issuance of stock options  warrants issued and re priced warrants and options at below fair market values in the first quarter of amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in amortization for purchased intangibles expense is the result of non cash charges related to the amortization of goodwill and intangibles created by the merger 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the merger  we allocated million of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development 
accordingly  these costs were expensed during the year upon finalization of a third party appraisal 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   representing a increase 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases in marketing activity  personnel costs  travel and patent filings 
other income expense other expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due primarily to the amortization of the debt discount from the beneficial conversion of a bridge loan entered into by us prior to the merger 
net loss per common share the following provides a reconciliation of information used in calculating the per share amounts for the year ended december  and december  the loss attributable to common shareholders includes an effect of an induced conversion of convertible preferred stock that took place in june loss attributable to common shareholders net loss   effect of induced conversion of convertible preferred stock  loss attributable to common shareholders   weighted average shares outstanding   basic and diluted loss per common share year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease 
revenues were lower due to reduced us government contract volume as a contract was completed during and the type of us government contract we engaged in changed primarily to cost sharing from cost plus fee contracts 
research and development expenses gross research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease 
the million decrease for reflects lower direct material costs 
of these amounts  we received million in cost sharing from the us government for and million in as of december   the remaining amounts to be incurred and billed on four active cost sharing contracts totaled million 
non cash expense for conversion of debt to common stock in  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the conversion of million of senior debt to  shares of common stock  which reflected a benefit the bondholder received at the date of conversion of the fair market value of the common stock over the contractual conversion price 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  representing a increase 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the establishment of a sales and marketing office in santa clara  california and additional patent filings 
other income expense other expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million was due to higher interest rates and a lower cash balance than in net loss the net loss increased to million in from million in liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including completion of our product development activities  ability to commercialize our products  market acceptance of our products and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our development programs directed at commercializing our products in our target markets  hire and train additional staff  expand our research and development activities  develop and expand our manufacturing capacity and begin production activities 
through december  we have incurred accumulated losses of approximately million since our inception and we anticipate incurring significant losses as we fund our growth 
since inception we have financed our operations through private placements of equity securities  research and development contracts and borrowings 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net loss partially offset by increases from non cash charges 
cash used in operating activities for was million and million in resulting primarily from operating losses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  this represented net cash acquired in acquisition of million  offset by capital expenditures of million 
net cash used by investing activities in was million primarily for capital expenditures 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million primarily for capital expenditures and the acquisition of virtual vision 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a private placement of million offset by decreases in short term debt and capital leases of million 
cash provided by financing activities for was million primarily from the issuance of short term debt and the issuance of preferred stock 
in june of  all of the preferred shareholders voted to convert their shares into common stock at conversion rates that ranged between to shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock 
cash provided by financing activities for was million primarily from the issuance of preferred stock 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future and that our operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
we expect that we will need to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development  selling and marketing activities and expansion of our manufacturing facilities  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in the event that we raise additional equity financing  further dilution to investors could result

accounting for certain derivative instrument and certain hedging activities  which amends the accounting and reporting standards of sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after june  as amended by sfas no 
and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements 
management believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
among other things  fin clarifies the definition of employees  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain of its conclusions cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the company adopted the provisions of fin as of july  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s cash equivalents and investment securities are at fixed interest rates  and as such  the fair market value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   all of the company s cash equivalents and investment securities mature within one year 
accordingly  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is immaterial 
however  in the future  we may invest in securities with maturities of more than one year  which may carry greater interest rate risk 
presently  all of the company s research and development contract payments are made in u 
s 
dollars and  consequently  we believe we have no direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  in the future  we may enter into contracts in foreign currencies  which may subject the company to foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not have any derivative instruments and do not presently engage in hedging transactions
