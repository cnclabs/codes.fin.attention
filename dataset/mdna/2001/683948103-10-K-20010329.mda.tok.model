item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview option care provides specialty pharmaceutical products and related services  infusion therapy and other ancillary healthcare services through a national network of company owned and franchise offices in states 
we derive our revenue from two product line segments specialty pharmacy and infusion and services 
our specialty pharmacy business consists of providing specialty drug distribution and pharmacy consulting services to managed care organizations  third party payors  physician groups and other providers 
our infusion and services business consists of providing a full range of infusion therapies  care management  medical equipment  data management  and other ancillary services through a national network of company owned and franchise owned option care locations 
option care s revenues are derived from two distinct segments i infusion and services  and ii specialty pharmacy 
the infusion and services segment primarily generates revenues by providing infusion and other healthcare services  through royalties due from option care franchises  and from sales and support of the software products created by our wholly owned subsidiary  management by information  inc the specialty pharmacy segment generates revenue through dispensing and delivering biotech and injectable pharmaceuticals to patients and physicians in a variety of settings 
summarized information about our revenues in each segment is provided below 
of of of total total total in thousands revenue infusion and services infusion therapy other healthcare services    royalty fees    product sales other    total infusion and services    specialty pharmacy    total revenue    the majority of our revenues are generated from managed care contracts and other agreements with commercial payors 
however  approximately of our revenues were derived from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
as a provider of specialty pharmacy and other healthcare services  our revenues and growth prospects are affected by trends and developments in governmental healthcare spending 
material changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements to us for products and services could affect our revenues and overall future financial performance 
our gross profit is largely controlled by our ability to negotiate profitable managed care contracts  and by our ability to leverage our size to purchase pharmaceutical products at comparatively low prices 
however  recent government investigations into how the average wholesale price awp for certain pharmaceuticals are determined could result in reduced pricing and margins on certain drugs that we currently supply 
various federal and state governmental agencies have been investigating whether the awp of many drugs is an appropriate or accurate measure of market prices from which governmental payors determine how much they reimburse for the drug 
many governmental payors pay us for some drugs based on that drug s awp  or at a percentage off awp 
in addition  we have also contracted with a number of private payors to sell at awp or at a percentage discount off awp 
awp for most drugs is compiled and published by private companies 
first databank  inc is one of these companies 
it has been reported that there are currently several lawsuits pending against manufacturers of certain drugs 
these government investigations and lawsuits involve allegations that manufacturers have misrepresented the actual selling price of certain drugs to first databank 
first databank has announced that it will base awp on market prices certified by the manufacturer 
first databank has published a market price survey that reduces the awp significantly for a number of the products option care currently supplies to patients 
we cannot predict the eventual results of these investigations  nor the changes made in awp by first databank 
if a reduced set of average wholesale prices became the standard by which we are reimbursed by government payors or private payors  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations  including reducing the pricing and margins on certain of our products 
in addition  there are currently various proposals under development to enact healthcare reform on national  state and local levels 
it is not possible at this time to predict the cash flow impact  if any  which any such changes may have on option care or any other providers of home healthcare services 
results of operations compared to revenue our net revenues increased by from million in to million in the million of revenue growth during was primarily in infusion therapy and specialty pharmacy 
approximately million  or of such increase was attributable to infusion therapy and other healthcare services revenue  of which approximately million was due to business acquisitions completed at various dates in in the cities of bellingham  wa  sterling  va and hemet  ca 
the remaining million increase during was due to same store sales growth over specialty pharmacy revenues increased  or million  primarily due to new managed care contracts  improved marketing of existing products and services and distribution of new products 
royalty revenues increased by due to same store growth within our franchise network 
gross profit option care s gross profit of million represented an increase of million  or  over this increase can be directly attributed to the million year to year increase in net revenues 
however  the overall gross profit percentage decreased from in to in this decrease is due to the stronger growth of the specialty pharmacy segment relative to the infusion and services segment 
the specialty pharmacy segment markets higher cost  lower margin injectables and other pharmaceutical products  and therefore generates a lower gross profit percentage than our infusion and services segment 
the specialty pharmacy segment gross profit percentage in was  as compared to a gross profit percentage of for infusion and services 
the faster growth rate of the specialty pharmacy segment over the infusion and services segment accounts for option care s overall decline in gross profit percentage 
the specialty pharmacy segment gross profit percentage was  while the infusion and services segment gross profit percentage was 
for both segments  the year to year decrease was due to an increase in higher cost  lower margin pharmaceutical product sales 
operating expenses total operating expenses of million were virtually equal to operating expenses of million 
this fact  combined with our million increase in revenues  resulted in operating expenses declining to of revenue in compared to in there are several reasons for this decline in percentage 
the increase in revenues in over came primarily from within our existing operations and facilities 
therefore  we incurred no direct increase in overhead expenses resulting from the increase in revenues 
also  while administrative wages and related costs increased by million  this increase was offset by reductions in other general and administrative expenses 
our provision for doubtful accounts decreased by million  from of revenues in to in goodwill amortization expense increased by thousand due to additional goodwill resulting from our acquisitions and additional payments on our and acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense in was million  which was equal to the million in in  positive operating cash flows of million from continuing operations were offset by payments for acquisitions of million  which consists of million for new businesses and million for additional payments on and acquisitions 
this resulted in a similar average credit line borrowing balance between the two years  and thus similar interest expense 
income taxes income taxes were provided for at a rate in compared to in the reduction in the income tax rate in versus was due to a re evaluation of our overall state tax liabilities  as well as from the favorable resolution of various tax matters previously reserved for as potential liabilities 
earnings per share as a result of the foregoing  option care recorded net income of million in  which represents an increase of million over net income equaled of revenues in compared to of revenues in as a result of the increase in net income  earnings per diluted share increased to in versus in the increase in earnings per share that resulted from our increase in net income was offset by a increase in diluted shares outstanding 
this increase was mostly due to the issuance of new shares of stock for three purposes i payment of stock earnouts under the terms of and acquisitions agreements  ii exercise of non qualified stock options by employees and former employees  and iii issuance of shares to employees who participated in our employee stock purchase plan 
compared to revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over revenues from our specialty pharmacy segment increased million  or  due to an increased focus on marketing and growing this segment 
revenues from our infusion and services segment declined by million  or  due primarily to our decision  made in the second and third quarters of  to terminate participation under contracts to perform network management services 
within the infusion and services segment  revenues from infusion therapy and other healthcare services increased million  or due to same store growth realized by our owned offices 
royalty revenues remained virtually unchanged  as same store growth within our franchise network compensated for a slight reduction in the total number of franchise locations in versus product sales and other revenue of million in consisted mainly of sales of software made through our wholly owned subsidiary  management by information  inc excluding the revenue recognized during under the terminated network management contracts  product sales and other revenue in increased by million as management by information mbi successfully rolled out its mbi homecare software during gross profit gross profit of million for represented an increase of million  or  from the million realized in our gross profit margin for increased to compared to in due primarily to a increase in the gross profit of the specialty pharmacy segment  from in to in improved managed care contract pricing and reduced cost of pharmaceuticals due to volume discounts were the reasons for this improvement 
our infusion and services segment experienced a improvement in gross profit margin in over this was mostly due to termination of our participation under network management service contracts in the second and third quarters of the revenues generated in under these contracts provided little or no gross margin on over million of network management revenue 
during the first quarter of  we changed our methodology for reporting gross profit 
costs deemed to be directly related to the production of revenues  such as pharmacy and nursing  remained in the cost of service  while all other costs  previously reported as patient care services operations were reclassified into selling  general and administrative 
we determined that the new method of reporting was more appropriate and provided a better indication of the actual gross profit provided by the revenue 
certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
operating expenses operating expenses for declined by million  or  to million from million in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or  primarily due to increased productivity 
the provision for doubtful accounts declined by million  or  due to the strong cash collections realized in of outstanding accounts receivable 
amortization of goodwill for was consistent with amortization 
interest expense interest expense declined by million  or  as overall debt was reduced from million at december  to million at december  the decline came in part from our use of cash on hand to reduce debt upon signing the new credit facility in the first quarter of in the third quarter of  we had discontinued our policy of using excess cash flow to pay down on our revolving credit facility 
once the new credit facility was in place  we re instituted this policy and used cash on hand to retire debt 
in addition  in we used our operating cash flow of million  generated by strong cash collections of outstanding accounts receivable and improved management of accounts payable  to minimize outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility 
income taxes income taxes were provided for at a rate reflecting our profitability during comparisons to prior year are not meaningful because we settled outstanding audits and recognized additional tax expense in earnings per share as a result of the forgoing  for the full year of  we recorded net income of million or of revenue  an increase of million over the net loss of million recorded in earnings per diluted share increased for the year from a loss of in to for  due to the increase in net income  offset by an  increase  or  of diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in the diluted shares is due to the increase in the market price of our stock at december  compared to december  and to the issuance of shares under certain and acquisition agreements 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  option care had no cash and cash equivalents 
under the terms of our revolving debt facility  we have the ability to borrow or pay down our existing debt on a daily basis as dictated by our operational cash flows 
this allows us to maintain a zero cash position  thereby minimizing our outstanding debt balance and interest expense 
net cash flows net cash flow provided by operations for was million  a small increase from the million of cash flow provided by operations in while net income increased by million in versus  accounts receivable increased by million  or  due to the fact that th quarter revenues of million exceeded th quarter revenues of million by this same 
this increase in accounts receivable was partially offset by a million decrease in inventory 
december  inventories had been increased as a precautionary measure related to year planning  and also to obtain favorable price reductions based on volume purchases of certain products 
no such temporary inventory increases existed as of december   therefore resulting in a decrease in inventory value compared to the prior year 
changes in other assets and liabilities accounted for the remainder of the year to year change in operating cash flows 
net cash flow used in investing activities for was million compared to million in the million increase was primarily due to million in cash payments for acquisitions 
another million related to payment of additional obligations under our and acquisition agreements compared to million paid in the remaining increase in cash flow used in investing activities consisted of a million increase in capital expenditures and million in additions to other assets  which included loan origination fees paid for securing our million term loan  as well as expenditures for development of our optionmed tm web site 
net cash flow provided by financing activities was million in versus net cash flow used by financing activities of million in  resulting in an million variance 
repayments of debt under our revolving credit facility in due to strong operating cash flows was the reason for the million cash flow usage in that year 
payments for our acquisitions and for obligations related to our and acquisitions exceeded our net operating cash flow 
therefore  the total outstanding obligations under our credit facility increased  resulting in million being provided by financing activities 
debt facility on february   option care entered into a million loan and security agreement with banc of america commercial finance corporation 
this agreement provided for borrowing up to million on revolving loans 
on june   the agreement was amended and restated to increase the total facility to million  consisting of million available on revolving loans  plus million available under term loans 
the purpose of the amendment was to allow option care the available capital to acquire selected franchises and outside healthcare companies upon approval by the lenders and by our board of directors 
under the revised agreement  we may enter into term loans from june  through june  repayments under these term loans will be made on a four year amortization schedule  with the first payment due july   except that the entire million facility is due to expire in february we would be subject to early termination fees if the loan were terminated prior to its natural expiration 
the amended and restated agreement requires option care to meet certain financial covenants including  but not limited to fixed charge coverage ratio  debt ratio  debt to operating cash flow ratio  and limitations on annual capital expenditures 
under this agreement  option care is prohibited from declaring any cash dividend on its common stock 
we paid a facility fee of million when the original agreement was signed in  and paid an additional million upon signing the amended and restated agreement on june  under the facility agreement  option care may elect interest rates on the revolving loan ranging from libor plus  to the bank s reference rate 
interest on the term loan ranges from libor plus  to the bank s reference rate plus 
availability under the overall facility is related to percentages of our outstanding accounts receivable and inventory balances  less certain ineligible amounts  as defined within the amended and restated loan and security agreement 
the facility is secured by all of the issued and outstanding common stock of each of option care s subsidiaries 
overall borrowings allowable under the revolving loan portion of the agreement are limited to the lesser of million or the total allowable collateral base 
we believe that cash flow from operations and amounts available under the existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet the cash needs of the business for the immediate future  including cash repayments due in under existing term loans 
in the event that additional capital is required  management cannot assure that such capital can be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
there are currently various proposals under development to enact healthcare reform on national  state and local levels 
at this time  we cannot predict the cash flow impact  if any  which any such changes may have on providers of home healthcare services and on our franchise and company owned option care offices 
goodwill and other intangible assets net goodwill and other intangible assets increased million  to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the majority of this increase was due to two factors i goodwill and other intangible assets of million resulting from our acquisition of businesses in bellingham  wa  hemet  ca  rockwall  tx  and sterling  va  and ii additional goodwill of million resulting from payments of additional consideration to former owners of businesses we acquired in and  per the applicable purchase agreements 
intangible assets represent of option care s total assets as of december  compared to as of december  this increase was the result of the acquisitions referenced above 
as a percentage of total stockholders equity  intangible assets declined from as of december  to as of december  this change was primarily due to option care s strong net income of million  as well as the issuance of million of new common stock  both of which increased total stockholders equity
