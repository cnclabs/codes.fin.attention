item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview carriage is a leading provider of death care services and products in the united states 
our historical focus has been on operational enhancements at facilities currently owned to increase revenues and gross profit  as well as growth through acquisitions although this activity was curtailed significantly in 
that focus has resulted in high standards of service  operational performance  and an infrastructure containing measurement and management systems 
the operating focus for included institutionalizing internal training  internal growth  and making quality initiatives introduced in an integral part of the culture 
in  the operating strategy was dramatically shifted to focus upon increasing operating cash flow 
in september  we launched a multi faceted  restructuring program  called fresh start  which is designed to increase financial and operating performance  improve cash flow  reduce debt  and assist carriage in fulfilling our mission of being the highest quality funeral and cemetery service organization in the industry 
many elements of this program have already been completed 
the implementation of sab retroactively effective with the beginning of the year had a significant impact on our operating results  particularly on the accounting for cemetery revenues and costs 
the accounting changes are summarized as follows preneed sales of interment rights burial property revenue and all costs are now recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method provides that revenue is recognized in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments equal or exceeds of the contract price related to the interment right 
previously  the revenue and costs were recognized at the time of contract execution with the customer 
preneed sales of merchandise revenue and all costs are now recognized when the merchandise is delivered 
previously  the revenue and costs were recognized at the time of contract execution with the customer 
preneed sales of cemetery service fees primarily openings and closings of burial property and installations of markers revenue and all costs are deferred until the service is performed 
previously  the revenue and costs were recognized at the time of contract execution with the customer 
earnings on cemetery merchandise and services trusts the trust earnings are deferred until the underlying merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
previously the earnings were recognized as they were earned on the trust investments 
preneed cemetery trust funds previously  cemetery trust funds were netted against preneed liabilities on the balance sheet 
the amount of these trusts  beginning january   are included in the non current asset section of the balance sheet 
preneed funeral contracts and deferred preneed funeral contract revenue the amount of the preneed funeral contracts receivable  the amount of the funds deposited in trust and the amount of life insurance contracts are recognized as an asset on the balance sheet titled preneed funeral contracts 
the amount of the preneed funeral contracts is also recognized in the liability section of the balance sheet titled deferred preneed funeral contracts revenue 
previously  these assets and liabilities were not recorded on the balance sheet 
the following table presents selected financial data for the years through on a pro forma basis assuming the application of the change in accounting principle at the beginning of the earliest year presented pro forma year ended december  in thousands revenue  net funeral     cemetery     total net revenues     gross profit funeral     cemetery   total gross profit     general and administrative expense     special and other charges  operating income     interest expense  net     settlement of litigation  income before income taxes    provision for income taxes    net income before extraordinary item    extraordinary item  net income loss after extraordinary item    preferred stock dividends net income loss available to common stockholders    all of the following through amounts  and comparisons thereto in the overview  results of operations and year ended december  compared to year ended december  sections  have been adjusted for the pro forma effect of applying the change in accounting to those periods for comparability 
the principal reason for the change between the revenues and gross profits when comparing the results for the year ended december   to the historical results for the year ended december  is the implementation of sab income from operations  which we define as earnings before special and other charges  interest and income taxes increased  as a percentage of net revenues  from in  to in  to in  and decreased to in income from operations  as a percentage of net revenues  for the year ended december   decreased to 
gross margins for funeral homes increased from in to in and decreased to in and to in as a percentage of cemetery net revenues  cemetery gross profit increased from in  to in  to in  and to in we have experienced significant growth since the end of when we owned facilities 
we acquired facilities in  facilities in  facilities in and two additional facilities in in a deliberate and managed process  we increased personnel and related infrastructure as a function of the increase in our revenue run rate 
as a consequence  general and administrative expenses increased from million in  to million in  to million in  to million in  excluding the special charge of million  and to million in  excluding the special and other charges totaling million 
however  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues over these periods  were in  in  in  in  exclusive of the special charge  and in  exclusive of the special and other charges 
the additional personnel filled critical roles in expanding the geographic coverage of both operations and preneed sales and marketing activities  as well as the financial  data processing and administrative functions needed to support the growing number of locations operating in a decentralized management fashion with timely financial and management information 
during this time we restructured and expanded the preneed funeral and cemetery sales organization significantly 
a key element of the fresh start program was the subsequent downsizing of our corporate organization  which was completed during the fourth quarter of a significant percentage of this overhead reduction related to the elimination of our national preneed funeral sales organization whose costs had been previously capitalized 
during  we acquired funeral homes and ten cemeteries for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
we acquired funeral homes and seven cemeteries during for approximately million 
during  we acquired funeral homes and cemeteries for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
we funded these acquisitions through cash flow from operations  additional borrowings under our credit facilities and issuance of preferred and common stock 
during  we reduced the price we were willing to pay for businesses as compared to the two most recent years  which resulted in a decline in acquisitions and related spending for in  acquisition activity was limited to one funeral home and a long term agreement to manage a municipal cemetery 
by the middle of it became clear that we were losing market share in certain of our markets and costs were not being reduced where we were losing business 
as part of our fresh start program  a rigorous review of the funeral home and cemetery businesses was conducted during the third and fourth quarter of  and our businesses was stratified into three groups core  underperforming and targeted for sale 
an estimate of the fair value less costs to sell was determined for each of the businesses that are categorized as targeted for sale 
impairment charges aggregating approximately million are included in special and other charges in the statement of operations for those businesses targeted for sale to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
proceeds on sales of businesses during the second half of totaled approximately million 
long term cash flow forecasts were prepared to evaluate the carrying value for those businesses categorized as underperforming 
in those instances in which our investment in the long lived assets of particular businesses was determined to exceed estimated future cash flows  the investment was written down  through an impairment charge  to the present value of those future cash flows 
impairment charges totaling million are also included in special and other charges in the statement of operations for the businesses that are categorized as underperforming 
for the year in our funeral segment  the core group represented of funeral home revenues and of field level cash flow  the underperforming group of revenues and of cash flow  and the sold and targeted for sale group of revenues and of cash flows 
in the statement of operations  other items included in special and other charges  that totaled million  consists of costs related to employee termination severance costs as a result of downsizing the corporate organization  accruals for office closures  write offs of other assets and adjustments to depreciation and amortization that resulted from restructuring actions 
special charges totaling million are included in accrued liabilities at december   substantially all of which are expected to be paid by december  because a substantial portion of the impairment charges were recorded against names and reputations at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter  the amount on the balance sheet was reduced from million at june  to million at december  amortization of names and reputations for the fourth quarter was million  or

operations acquired or opened during either year being compared are referred to as acquired operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  funeral home segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from our funeral home operations during the years ended december  and year ended december  change pro forma amount percent dollars in thousands net revenues    gross profit    existing operations performed fewer services in  compared to  at an average price that was higher than  resulting in a decrease in revenue of  from to acquired operations provided an increase in revenue of  and there was a decrease in revenue in comparing to of  because of businesses that were sold or discontinued during the period 
the impact on field level revenues by the three groups was as follows average number of revenue per revenues increase decrease as compared to services service in s core  underperforming  targeted for sale gross profit decreased from to primarily because of the operating results of the underperforming and targeted for sale groups and higher operating costs that were not passed through in way of higher prices to the consumer 
within our existing businesses  the decline in gross profit was very pronounced in the underperforming and targeted for sale groups 
higher operating costs occurred in the form of casket and merchandise price increases  insurance increases  as well as general inflation in salaries and wages 
additionally  depreciation and amortization were higher in  compared to cemetery segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from cemetery operations for the years ended december  and year ended december  change pro forma amount percent dollars in thousands net revenues    gross profit   cemeteries acquired in and contributed additional revenues of approximately million and attributed to the majority of the increase in gross profit 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased million or over as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in interest expense for the year ended december   increased million or over resulting from higher financing costs and interest rates  and higher debt levels resulting from the prior year acquisitions 
special and other charges for the year ended december  were million as discussed in the previous overview section compared to million for the year ended december  the special and other charges related to compensation charges in connection with contract extensions to certain top executive officers

carriage provided for income taxes and tax benefits on income before income taxes and extraordinary item at a combined state and federal tax rate of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of names and reputations related to certain acquisitions  which is nondeductible  is the primary cause of our effective rate exceeding the combined federal and state statutory income tax rates in the sale of properties in generated substantial losses for income tax purposes 
the low tax rate for the year is due to the limitation on the tax benefit  of those losses  to the amount that can reasonably be expected to be refunded in the foreseeable future from carrybacks of the tax loss 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  funeral home segment 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from our funeral home operations during the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands net revenues existing operations    acquired operations    total net revenues    gross profit existing operations   acquired operations    total gross profit    not meaningful 
as a result of carriage s rapid growth  existing operations represented only of the total funeral revenues and only of the total funeral gross profit for the year ended december  total funeral net revenues for the year ended december   increased million or over the higher net revenues reflect an increase of million in net revenues from acquired operations and an increase in net revenues of million or from existing operations 
for existing operations there was a increase in the average revenue per funeral service  and a increase in the number of funeral services performed 
total funeral gross profit for the year ended december   increased million or over the higher total gross profit reflected an increase of million from acquired operations and a slight decrease from existing operations 
gross profit for existing operations decreased primarily due to the increase in the percent of funeral services which involved cremations compared to the prior year  as well as a higher portion of incentive compensation payable in cash rather than in stock options 
total gross margin decreased from for to for cemetery segment 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from cemetery operations for the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands net revenues existing operations   acquired operations    total net revenues    gross profit existing operations   acquired operations   total gross profit    not meaningful

total gross margin decreased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to our acquisition of cemeteries during  and increased preneed marketing expenditures 
other during  the board of directors authorized new five year contracts to certain top executive officers 
a special compensation charge in the amount of million was recorded in general and administration expenses in connection with the contract extensions 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased million or over the increase was million or without the special compensation charge 
as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased  without including the special compensation charge  as the expenses were spread over a larger volume of revenue 
interest expense for the year ended december   increased million or over due to higher financing costs and interest rates and increased borrowings for acquisitions 
all of the series f redeemable preferred stock  or approximately million  were converted to class a common stock by december  dividends on this preferred stock were per annum 
preferred dividends of  for and  for were subtracted from net income in computing earnings attributable to common stockholders  for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per common share 
the reduction in preferred stock dividends from to was due to conversions of preferred stock to common stock during the year 
carriage provided for income taxes on income before income taxes and extraordinary item at a combined state and federal tax rate of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of names and reputations related to certain acquisitions  which is nondeductible  is the primary cause of our effective rate exceeding the combined federal and state statutory income tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   representing an increase of  from december  for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by operations was principally a result of a decrease in the growth of receivables  inventory and preneed funeral costs 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in  primarily due to a slowing in the number of acquisitions in as compared to the number in in  cash flow used by financing activities amounted to approximately million  primarily due to the payments to prior owners on acquisition related obligations incurred in prior years  and the fees associated with the modification of our financial covenants  a critical element in our fresh start restructuring program 
at december   the company had additional obligations of contingent payments to prior owners outstanding totaling up to million 
approximately half of these obligations are anticipated to be due in the second quarter of with the remainder due in the first quarter of aside from these obligations  for the next two years the company currently intends to utilize the majority of free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of assets to reduce the amount of debt outstanding and thereby improve credit ratios 
on june   the company s subsidiary  carriage services capital trust  completed the sale of  units of convertible preferred securities  with a maturity in years  resulting in approximately million in net proceeds to the company  of which million was used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the company s credit facility  with the remaining million used for general corporate purposes 
on july   the company issued million in senior debt notes and used the proceeds to reduce the amount outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit 
the notes are unsecured  mature in traunches of million in five  million in seven and million in nine years and bear interest at the fixed rates of  and  respectively 
historically  we have financed our acquisitions with proceeds from debt and the issuance of common and preferred stock 
as of december  and  we had  shares of series d preferred stock issued and outstanding 
the series d preferred stock is convertible into class b common stock 
the holders of series d preferred stock are entitled to receive cash dividends at an annual rate of 
to 
per share depending upon when such shares were issued 
the company may  at its option  redeem all or any portion of the shares of series d preferred stock then outstanding at a redemption price of per share  together with all accrued and unpaid dividends 
such redemption is subject to the right of each holder of series d preferred stock to convert such holder s shares into shares of class b common stock 
on december   we must redeem all shares of series d preferred stock  then outstanding  at a redemption price of per share  together with all accrued and unpaid dividends 
during the twelve months ended december   holders of series d preferred stock converted no shares into shares of class a common stock 
at december   the company had a credit facility with a group of banks for a million revolving line of credit 
on november   we finalized our modified credit agreement to include a reduction in our bank revolving credit facility from million to million 
the reduction in the revolving credit capacity reflected our intention to not make any additional large acquisitions and  therefore we did not wish to continue paying a commitment fee for availability that was not going to be used 
with million available under our revolving credit facility at march   the company is currently positioned with adequate financial liquidity 
we have no significant maturities until and expect to have sufficient free cash flow to satisfy or refinance our scheduled maturities as they occur 
at december   the company s debt to total capitalization was 
the company s credit facility and senior notes modifications included new covenants containing the following flexibility in the minimum net worth requirement to allow for restructuring charges  the addition of a limit on the maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which becomes more restrictive over time  and the addition of a provision limiting acquisitions above a certain size without prior approval 
while the company projects that we will be able to stay within our financial covenants  there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
similar modifications to the senior notes agreements additionally require that a significant portion of any proceeds from the sales of assets be offered to the note holders as prepayment of the amounts outstanding 
at december   there was million in principle amount outstanding under these notes 
in the first quarter of prepayments were made in the amount of million related to the million proceeds from the sales of assets in the fourth quarter of during the company modified its approach to marketing preneed funeral contracts to emphasize insurance products over trust products  eliminate the national and regional overhead management structure and outsource a significant portion of the administration 
these changes significantly reduced the cash investment that has historically been required to generate this backlog of business 
in  million of preneed funeral sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
in  million of preneed funeral sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
in  it is anticipated that both the level of preneed funeral sales and the related cash outlay will be further reduced 
during the twelve months ended december   the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily related to constructing new funeral home facilities at a number of our locations 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility should be sufficient to fund any acquisitions and anticipated capital expenditures as well as other ongoing operating requirements 
during  the company spent approximately million for the acquisition of a cemetery municipal agreement  one funeral home and other acquisition related activity 
acquisition spending during is anticipated to be less than the amounts during either of the two preceding years 
the company anticipates that the capital expenditures in will primarily be limited to those that are required to maintain the revenue capability of its existing businesses 
it does not anticipate making significant capital expenditures to grow or enhance new revenue streams or acquire new businesses 
because future cash flows and the availability of financing are subject to a number of variables there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to fund its capital needs 
additional debt and equity financings may be required in the future 
the availability and terms of these capital sources will depend on prevailing market conditions and interest rates and the then existing financial condition of the company 
accounting changes in december  the securities and exchange commission the commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which  as amended  was implemented for the fourth quarter of  and applied retroactively to the first three quarters of this fiscal year  to provide guidance related to recognizing revenue in circumstances in which no specific authoritative literature exists 
members of the death care industry  in consultation with the commission  have agreed to certain changes in the manner in which cemetery preneed sales and costs are recorded 
the change that is most meaningful to the company is a change from recording cemetery merchandise and service revenue and their related costs at the time the contract is executed  to the period in which they are delivered 
these accounting changes do not result in a material change in net cash flows nor the amount of revenues we ultimately expect to realize 
the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for which the effective date was deferred to years beginning after june  by sfas no 
 and amended by sfas no 
to establish accounting and financial reporting standards for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
the key provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  are that every derivative will be recognized as an asset or liability at its fair value and that later changes in fair value are generally reported in earnings or other comprehensive income 
the company is currently engaged in interest rate swaps that have a notional amount of million to hedge against rising interest rates on its variable rate long term debt 
the swaps  which had a fair value of million and  at december  and december   respectively  are currently carried off balance sheet  but will be reflected on the balance sheet at fair value when the company implements sfas effective january  potential accounting change the financial accounting standards board has issued an exposure draft  which would change certain aspects in the manner in which businesses account for business combinations 
we expect these changes to be prospective in the nature of adoption 
the most significant of the proposed changes to carriage would be the elimination of the amortization of names and reputations  which would have an estimated pre tax impact of approximately million or 
per diluted share per year  and testing to determine impairments  if any  for long lived assets 
the final pronouncement may change from the exposure draft 
seasonality although the death care business is relatively stable and fairly predictable  our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  death rates are higher during the winter months 
in addition  our quarterly results may fluctuate depending on the magnitude and timing of acquisitions 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of carriage s operations during the last three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure carriage is exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
carriage is currently exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
our variable rate long term borrowings primarily consist of the million outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit maturing in any change in the floating rate will cause a change in interest expense 
we seek to minimize the risk that interest rates will increase by entering into interest rate swap transactions 
as of december   we were engaged in two interest rate swaps in which we exchange the floating rate payments for fixed rate payments at day intervals 
the interest rate swaps have a combined notional amount of million  mature in  and have a weighted average fixed rate of and a fair value of  at december  any decrease in market interest rates  assuming all other things being equal  causes the fair value of our interest rate swaps to decrease 
the remainder of carriage s long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease
