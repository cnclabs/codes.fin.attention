see item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a million special charge 
the special charge is comprised of the following non recurring items dollars in s asset valuation accrued liabilities total impairment of carrying value of restaurants   impairment or write off of certain assets  principally technology assets reserve for franchise notes receivable   closure of restaurants    closing of field offices  severance and exit costs  settlement of vendor litigation total    statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 requires impairment losses to be recognized for long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the estimate of undiscounted cash flows is not sufficient to recover asset carrying amounts 
sfas no 
also requires long lived assets held for disposal to be carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less costs of disposal  once management has committed to a plan of disposal or closure 
the company determined that certain domestic restaurants were impaired due to specific operational performance indicators 
certain domestic restaurants operational performance declined during due to increased competition and increased operating expenses  such as salaries  reflecting general operating conditions 
in addition  the performance of certain acquired markets did not meet expectations in  which indicated that some of the acquired restaurants were impaired 
during our review for potentially impaired restaurants  we considered several indicators  including individual restaurant profitability  annual comparable sales  operating trends  as well as actual operating results 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we estimated the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated lives of the assets for each of our restaurants that met certain impairment indicators and compared these estimates to the carrying values of the underlying assets 
the forecasted cash flows were based on our assessment of the individual store s future profitability which is based on the restaurant s historical results  the maturity of the restaurant s market as well as our future plans for the restaurant and its market 
in estimating forecasted cash flows  we used a discount rate of which approximates the return we would expect on those types of investments 
based on our analysis  we determined that restaurants were impaired by a total of million 
the impairment or write off of certain assets was principally comprised of technology assets  including the development of our on line ordering capabilities 
the company reviewed the future use of certain technological and other assets and determined that the assets were no longer beneficial to the company or the carrying value of the assets was impaired due to lower future cash flows based on our updated strategy to focus on our primary business activities 
based on an asset analysis and an analysis of estimated future cash flows in accordance with sfas no 
 a charge of million was recorded 
we established a reserve of million for franchisee notes receivable 
we concluded the reserve was necessary due to certain franchisees deteriorating economic performance and underlying collateral value 
substantially all of the reserve  approximately million  relates to notes receivable with a related party franchisee 
prior to year end  we identified and committed to close restaurants in due to deteriorating economic performance and poor outlook for improvement 
a charge of million was recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to close field offices to reduce future costs and to allow our operations area supervisors and district managers to spend more time in our restaurants 
we also eliminated certain positions in the fourth quarter to reduce future administrative costs 
these actions resulted in a charge of million in the fourth quarter 
in december  the company agreed to pay  to settle a lawsuit with a vendor 
the special charge resulted in a write down of asset carrying value of million and the establishment of accrued liabilities for cash payments of million 
we paid approximately  during the fourth quarter related to these liabilities 
we anticipate paying a majority of the remaining liabilities associated with this special charge during the payments are expected to be made from operating cash flow 
the impairment of the restaurant and other corporate assets in will reduce depreciation and amortization in approximately million as compared to the closing of the field offices and the severance and exit costs will reduce salaries and operating expenses approximately  in as compared to pre opening and other general expenses decreased to million in from million in pre opening costs of million  relocation costs of million and net gains on restaurant and other asset dispositions of  were included in the amount  as compared to pre opening costs of  relocation costs of million and net losses on restaurant and other asset dispositions of million in depreciation and amortization was of revenues in compared to for  due primarily to a full year of depreciation on the corporate headquarters facility  a full year of goodwill amortization on the perfect pizza acquisition in as compared to only a partial year impact of each of these items in  as well as the goodwill amortization related to restaurants purchased during the purchase of perfect pizza in november resulted in million of goodwill

through december  we earned approximately million million in  million in and million in of an expected million in incentives under the kentucky jobs development act in connection with the relocation of the corporate offices 
we expect to earn the remaining million of such incentives through impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs  particularly labor  benefits  food  utilities and fuel costs  could have a significant impact on us 
thus far in  we have continued to experience higher than normal utility and fuel costs and ongoing wage rate pressures 
our restaurant and commissary margins continue to be impacted by these cost factors 
cheese costs appear to be returning to more historical levels  after being unusually low throughout most of  however  this increase in costs will not begin to impact our restaurant margins until the third quarter of due to our existing cheese purchasing arrangement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this annual report  particularly information regarding future financial performance and plans and objectives of management  is forward looking 
certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  our ability and the ability of our franchisees to obtain suitable locations and financing for new restaurant development  the hiring  training  and retention of management and other personnel  competition in the industry with respect to price  service  location  and food quality  an increase in food cost due to seasonal fluctuations  weather  and demand  changes in consumer tastes and demographic trends  changes in federal and state laws  such as increases in minimum wage  and risks inherent to international development  including operational or market risks associated with the planned conversion of perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s in the united kingdom 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s debt at december  is principally comprised of a million outstanding principal balance on the million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is variable and is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
an increase in interest rate of basis points would increase interest expense approximately million annually 
the weighted average interest rate on the revolving line of credit was in and as of december  in march  we entered into a million interest rate collar  which is effective until march the collar establishes a floor and a ceiling on the libor base rate on a no fee basis 
substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations do not have a significant impact on the company 
cheese  representing approximately to of our food cost  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  availability  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
we have entered into a purchasing arrangement with a third party entity formed at the direction of the franchise advisory council for the sole purpose of reducing cheese price volatility 
under this arrangement  we are able to purchase cheese at a fixed quarterly price  based in part on historical average cheese prices 
gains and losses incurred by the selling entity will be used as a factor in determining adjustments to the selling price over time 
ultimately  we will purchase cheese at a price approximating the actual average market price  but with less short term volatility
