item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general over half of the company s processing volumes consist of aluminum tolled for its customers 
tolling revenues reflect only the processing cost and the company s profit margin 
the company s processing activities also consist of the processing  recovery and specialty alloying of aluminum and zinc metal and the production of value added zinc products for sale by the company 
the revenues from these sales transactions include the cost of the metal  as well as the processing cost and the company s profit margin 
accordingly  tolling business produces lower revenues and costs of sales than product sales business 
variations in the mix between tolling and product sales business could cause revenue amounts to change significantly from period to period while not significantly affecting gross profit 
as a result  the company considers processing volume to be a more important determinant of performance than revenues 
the facilities acquired by the company since see acquisitions below are primarily engaged in product sales activities as opposed to tolling  therefore  the company has experienced higher levels of product sales relative to tolling in than in prior periods 
this higher level of sales has also increased the company s working capital requirements and  as a result  has subjected the company to the additional risks associated with price fluctuations in the zinc and aluminum commodity markets 
the following table shows total pounds processed  the percentage of total pounds processed represented by tolled metals  total revenues and total gross profits in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  pounds processed    percent of pounds tolled revenues    gross profits    in addition to its increased emphasis on the product sales business  the company has also entered into an increasing amount of metal brokerage transactions each year under which the company buys metal from primary and other producers and then sells the metal to end users 
these transactions involve buying and selling metal without processing it 
also  in order to facilitate acquiring metal for its production process  the company occasionally enters into metal swap transactions whereby the company agrees to exchange its recycled finished goods for scrap raw materials 
as with the product sales business  the brokerage business increases the company s working capital requirements and subjects the company to greater price risk associated with fluctuations in the metals commodity markets

fiscal special factors and fiscal outlook certain of the statements below contain projections and estimates based on current expectations for these statements are forward looking in nature and actual results may differ materially due to a number of reasons  as more fully described under the section titled cautionary statement for purposes of forward looking statements below 
these statements do not reflect the potential impact of acquisitions or divestitures that may be completed or unforeseen events that may occur after the date of this filing 
during  market factors that negatively affected the company s results of operations and financial condition included 
reduced volume at its aluminum recycling facilities due to lower market demand from customers serving the aluminum can stock market  
markedly higher natural gas fuel costs in both the aluminum and zinc segments  
softening of market conditions for its customers serving the truck  trailer and construction sectors  
higher costs of scrap coupled with lower selling prices for its finished aluminum products due to excess overall industry capacity at the company s aluminum alloying facilities  and 
lower margins in both the aluminum and zinc segments 
the reduction in demand for company recycling services from aluminium can stock customers  which are also generally major primary processors  began in the second half of  when competition for ubc s drove ubc and scrap prices higher for these customers 
this price increase resulted in these customers increasingly satisfying their supply needs for can stock production from their primary aluminum processing capacity  instead of using secondary recycling services 
this trend continued through and is expected to continue until lower prices for ubc s or higher prices for can stock improve these customers margins 
as a result of these market factors  the company decided in  to reduce some of its capacity and reallocate that processing work to other facilities 
in january it permanently closed its bedford  indiana aluminum facility and its chicago  illinois zinc oxide plant 
it also temporarily shut down its wendover  utah facility  due to a decrease in dross processing from primary aluminum customers in the pacific northwest caused by capacity curtailments by those customers due to high power rates 
the post falls  idaho facility will handle the wendover plant s volumes until primary production at commercial levels resumes in the pacific northwest 
in  the company closed an aluminum processing facility in sikeston  missouri 
for fiscal  the company expects many of the conditions currently prevailing to continue 
continued weak demand from can stock customers and lower margins in the alloys business  coupled with higher fuel costs  should continue to negatively impact the company s results of operations for its aluminum alloys and aluminum recycling businesses 
however  management anticipates some margin improvement for its aluminum segment in  due to expected increased demand in the automotive sector  changes in company scrap buying procedures  reduced inventories  and reallocation of processing volumes among its aluminum plants 
the company s zinc segment experienced declining margins during the fourth quarter of  due to the impact of higher fuel prices and a zinc price decline due to weaker us economic conditions 
the company is continuing to focus on its cost reduction initiatives 
in the aluminum alloys business  the company is working to improve margins by revising contract terms with suppliers and customers where possible 
the company has reduced personnel headcount by seven percent from the beginning of and is reducing discretionary spending 
closing less efficient facilities and reallocating those facilities processing work to other facilities should result in future cost savings 
in addition  the company is beginning to recover a portion of the higher gas costs it experienced in through escalation clauses that form a part of some customer contracts 
these escalator provisions generally take effect following the periods in which the company actually incurs the higher fuel costs 
in certain instances where contracts do not provide for escalator clauses  the company has added natural gas surcharges to its tolling or sales prices 
additional positive factors which may positively affect fiscal results include programs to improve the allocation of processing work throughout the company s network of facilities  new rotary furnaces designed to consume less energy  and furnace burner technology retrofits to reduce energy consumption and increase processing productivity 
the company is also continuing to review expansion opportunities  particularly in europe and in latin america  through expansion of its major customer relationships  and project venture partnering opportunities 
further expansions of the vaw imco joint venture facilities are planned in as well 
no assurances can be made that any of these anticipated results will actually be achieved 
in addition  the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
fiscal charges during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded pretax charges of million  including a million charge related primarily to the shutdown of the bedford facility 
acquisitions in july  the company completed the acquisition of us zinc corporation for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in february  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of an aluminum alloying facility located in shelbyville  tennessee for approximately  in cash not including acquisition costs 
also in february  the company acquired  through its wholly owned subsidiary  midwest zinc corporation  substantially all of the assets of a zinc oxide production facility located in clarksville  tennessee for approximately  in cash not including acquisition costs 
both acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
results of operations fiscal year vs 
fiscal year production 
during  the company melted billion pounds compared with billion pounds in the aluminum and zinc segments accounted for and  respectively  of the overall production increase for tolling activity in represented of total pounds processed compared to in the following table shows the total pounds processed and the percentage tolled for the aluminum and zinc segments in thousands  except percentages for the year ended december  pounds processed aluminum   zinc   total pounds processed   percentage tolled aluminum zinc total percentage tolled aluminum production during  the company melted about the same amount of aluminum as it did during the results reflected increases from the shelbyville  tennessee facility acquired in february  and from the uhrichsville  ohio facility 
the increase in the ohio facility was the result of adding two new reverberatory furnaces in late these increases were offset by decreases  primarily in the can stock business 
production declined at the rockwood  tennessee and post falls  idaho facilities due to the reduction in volumes from a major customer at each of these locations 
additionally  an overall weakening in demand  caused by the slowing economy  affected production 
the decrease in aluminum percentage tolled is primarily due to the shelbyville  tennessee facility  the production of which is dedicated primarily for product sales instead of tolling  and to a lesser extent  increased product sale business at the plants where toll customers reduced volumes 
zinc production during  the company melted more zinc than it did during the increase in zinc production was due to strong demand for value added products 
the decrease in zinc percentage tolled is primarily due to including a full year of production from the clarksville  tennessee facility acquired in february  which is virtually dedicated to product sales 
revenues 
during  the company s consolidated revenues increased to  compared to revenues of  in the aluminum and zinc segments accounted for and  respectively  of the overall increase of revenues 
the following table shows the total revenues for the aluminum and zinc segments in thousands for the year ended december  revenues aluminum   zinc   total revenues   aluminum revenues during  the company s aluminum revenues increased compared to  due to slightly higher aluminum production volumes as a result of facility expansions and the shelbyville  tennessee acquisition  and a decrease in the proportion of volumes from tolling versus product sales see aluminum production above 
increased product sales generally result in a greater increase in revenues than a similar increase in tolling business 
zinc revenues during  the company s zinc revenues increased compared to zinc revenues increased primarily due to higher zinc production volumes and higher zinc product sale prices due to increased demand for value added zinc products such as zinc oxide 
gross profits 
during  the company s consolidated gross profits decreased to  compared to gross profits of  in the aluminum segment contributed to the overall decline in segment income by a decrease of over this decrease was off set by a slight increase of in zinc segment income 
the following table shows the total income for the aluminum and zinc segments and a reconciliation of segment income to the company s consolidated gross profits in thousands for the year ended december  segment income aluminum   zinc   total segment income   items not included in gross profits plant selling expense   management sg a costs   equity in earnings of affiliates   other income gross profits   aluminum income during  the company s aluminum income decreased compared to the decrease was primarily due to weaker volumes at several aluminum recycling plants  particularly those that serve the can stock producers  coupled with lower margins in the specification alloys business and much higher natural gas costs at all plant locations 
the weak aluminum alloys margins resulted from both higher raw material costs and weaker selling prices for aluminum alloys 
recent capacity increases in the aluminum alloys business resulted in heightened competition for available scrap metal units  which the company uses as raw material in its aluminum alloys production 
this  in turn  produced more intense competition for metal units  causing higher purchase costs  and drove selling prices lower 
lower demand from a weakening economy during was also a major contributor to the overall decline in aluminum income 
zinc income during  the company s zinc income increased compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for value added zinc products 
sg a expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to  compared to  in the increase is primarily due to more production facilities on line in compared to and increased incentive compensation expense for payments to certain senior management employees of the company s zinc segment under the terms of an earn out agreement 
selling expenses trended higher in as well  primarily due to the increase in product sales 
product sales require additional marketing efforts and associated expenses  as opposed to tolling transactions 
amortization expense 
amortization expense in increased to  compared to  in the increase is due almost entirely to amortization of additional goodwill recorded as a result of the shelbyville and clarksville  tennessee acquisitions see acquisitions above 
interest expense 
interest expense in increased to  compared to  in the increase is the result of increased interest rates during and higher amounts of debt outstanding in compared to  primarily resulting from additional working capital requirements and higher capital spending levels 
fees on receivables sale 
on november   the company and certain of its originating subsidiaries entered into a receivables sale facility with a qualified special purpose entity qspe subsidiary of the company  under which the originators sold their right  title and interest in and to certain trade accounts receivable pooled receivables to the qspe  which in turn sold undivided interests in the receivables pool to an unaffiliated issuer 
fees in connection with this transfer for the year ended december   were  see note c sale of receivables of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net earnings 
net earnings decreased to  in compared to  in the decrease was primarily the result of lower profits in the aluminum segment business see gross profits and aluminum income above 
in addition  the increases in amortization expense  interest expense  and selling  general and administrative expense reduced net earnings 
at december   earnings contributed by vaw imco  the company s joint venture  were  see the vaw imco financial statements under
