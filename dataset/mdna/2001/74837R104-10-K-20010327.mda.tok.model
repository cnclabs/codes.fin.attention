liquidity and capital resources general the following discussion compares the company s financial condition at december  and for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  was spent on acquisition and development activities 
the capital program was financed from operations  additional borrowings  a restructured bank facility  monetization of a portion of acquired section tax credits and the sale of subordinated notes 
cash flow the company believes that its capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of its business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and gas prices  and there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
as part of the acquisition of the cms properties and terra energy ltd  on march   the company amended the agreement setting forth the terms of its credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility is a three year revolving credit facility that matures on march  and permits the company to obtain revolving credit loans and to issue letters of credit for the account of the company from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
the borrowing base is million and is subject to semi annual determination and certain other redeterminations based upon a variety of factors  including the discounted present value of estimated future net cash flow from the company s natural gas and crude oil production 
the next scheduled re determination date will be as of april   based on december  assets and proved reserves 
at the company s option  loans may be prepaid  and revolving credit commitments may be reduced in whole or in part at any time in certain minimum amounts 
as of year end  the company can designate the interest rate on amounts outstanding at either the london interbank offered rate libor or bank prime 
at december   the company s interest rate was through april  on million 
the collateral for the credit facility consists of substantially all of the existing assets of the company and any future reserves acquired 
the loan agreements prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends by the company and contain other restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require the maintenance of a minimum current ratio 
the company currently is in compliance with all such restrictions 
at december   the company had  available under the credit facility  which terminates march  the company s principal operating sources of cash include sales of natural gas and crude oil and revenues from transportation and processing 
the company sells approximately of its natural gas production under long term  fixed price contracts  and swap agreements 
as a result  the company benefits from significant predictability of its natural gas revenues 
commodity market prices affect cash flow for that portion of natural gas not under contract as well as the company s crude oil sales 
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase resulted from higher earnings  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the cms properties  and higher non cash charges 
net cash used in investing for the year ended december  was  investing activities were comprised primarily of additions to oil and gas properties through the acquisition of the cms properties million  development activity and  to a lesser extent  additions of field service assets 
net cash from financing activities for the year ended december  was  the cms acquisition was financed through restructuring of quicksilver s senior bank facility  the sale of million in subordinated notes  and the monetization through a major financial institution of a portion of the accompanying internal revenue code section income tax credits related to the cms properties

recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities amended by sfas no 

this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if hedge accounting criteria are met  the change in a derivative s fair value for a cash flow hedge is deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the hedge item to the extent the hedge is effective 
the ineffective portions of hedge returns are recognized currently in earnings 
all derivatives within the company have been identified as of january  the company has designated  documented and assessed the hedging relationships  all of which are cash flow hedges 
adoption by the company of this accounting standard as of january  resulted in the recognition of million of derivative liabilities with a cumulative effect of million after tax as a decrease to other comprehensive income 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements which summarized the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company does not believe the adoption of staff accounting bulletin will have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations since it recognizes revenue upon completion of the earnings process 
sales from producing wells are recognized as the title passes to the purchasers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has established policies and procedures for managing risk within its organization  including internal controls 
the level of risk assumed by the company is based on its objectives and capacity to manage risk 
quicksilver s primary risk exposure is related to natural gas commodity prices 
the company has mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of swaps  futures and forward contracts  however  it has also limited future gains from favorable movements 
commodity price risk the company enters into various financial contracts to hedge its exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas production 
these contracts have included price ceilings and floors  no cost collars and fixed price swaps 
quicksilver sells approximately  mcf day of natural gas under long term fixed price contracts at mcf through march approximatley of the volumes sold under long term contracts are third party volumes controlled by the company 
approximately  mcf day of its equity natural gas are hedged using fixed price swap agreements 
as a result  the company benefits from significant predictability of its natural gas revenues 
commodity price fluctuations affect the remaining natural gas volumes as well as the company s crude oil and ngl volumes 
up to  mcf day of natural gas is commited at market price through may additional gas volumes of  mcf day are committed at market price through september a portion of the natural gas volumes sold under these contracts are third party volumes controlled by quicksilver 
utilization of the company s hedging program may result in natural gas and crude oil realized prices varying from market prices that the company receives from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
as a result of the hedging programs  revenues in and were  and  respectively  lower than if the hedging program had not been in effect 
the following table summarizes the company s open positions as of december  related to natural gas production 
based on the financial fixed price hedge positions  for each per mcf increase in the price of natural gas the company s annualized revenue would increase by approximately  of which  would be reduced due to the existing hedges 
contract weighted ave product type time period volume price per mcf fair value gas fixed price jan apr  mcfd  gas fixed price jan oct mcfd  gas fixed price jan apr  mcfd  gas fixed price jan apr  mcfd  gas fixed price jan apr  mcfd  fair values were determined based on current market prices at december   as quoted by recognized dealers without regard to market liquidity 
the actual gains or losses ultimately realized by the company from such hedges may vary significantly from the foregoing amounts due to the volatility of the natural gas commodity markets 
interest rate risk the company has an interest rate swap agreement covering million of its variable rate debt through june  that converts the debt floating libor base rate to a fixed rate 
the fair value of this swap was a loss of  as of december  on october   the company entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement covering million of its variable rate debt through march   which converts the debt floating libor base rate to a fixed rate 
the fair value of this swap was a loss of  as of december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  lower as a result of interest rate swaps 
if interest rates on the company s remaining variable debt increase or decrease by one percentage point  the company s annual pretax income would decrease or increase by  credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
the company sells its oil and gas production directly under long term contracts and through cinnabar energy services trading  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary  to creditworthy counterparties  such as utilities  major oil companies or their affiliates  industrial customers  large trading companies or energy marketing companies  refineries and other users of petroleum products 
in this manner  quicksilver reduces such credit risk 
performance risk performance risk results when a financial counter party fails to fulfill its contractual obligations such as commodity pricing or volume commitments 
typically  such risk obligations are defined within the trading agreements 
the company manages performance risk through management of credit risk 
each customer and or counter party of the company is reviewed as to credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit and on a regular basis thereafter 
foreign currency risk the company s canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk
