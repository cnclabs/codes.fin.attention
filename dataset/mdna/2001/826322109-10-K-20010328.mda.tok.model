overview we derive revenues from our health maintenance organizations  managed indemnity  military health care services and workers compensation insurance subsidiaries 
to a lesser extent  we also derive additional specialty product revenues from non hmo and insurance products consisting of fees for workers compensation administration  utilization management services and ancillary products  professional fees consisting primarily of fees for providing health care services to non members and co payment fees received from members  and investment and other revenue 
our principal expenses consist of medical expenses  military contract expenses  specialty product expenses  and general  administrative and marketing expenses 
medical expenses represent capitation fees and other fee for service payments paid to independently contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care providers to cover members  as well as the aggregate expenses to operate and manage our multi specialty medical groups and other provider subsidiaries 
as a provider of health care management services  we seek to positively affect quality of care and expenses by employing or contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers at negotiated price levels  by adopting quality assurance programs  monitoring and managing utilization of physicians and hospital services and providing incentives to use cost effective providers 
military contract expenses represent the expenses of delivering health care  as agreed to in the tricare contract with the federal government  as well as administrative costs to operate the military health care subsidiary 
specialty product expenses primarily consist of losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses and other general and administrative expenses associated with our workers compensation insurance subsidiaries 
general  administrative and marketing expenses generally represent operational costs other than those associated with the delivery of health care services  military contract services and specialty product services 
calendar year was one of significant challenges and successes for sierra 
in the first quarter  we engaged a consulting firm to assist us in evaluating our texas operations 
one of the results of this evaluation was the development of action plans to improve our texas operations 
this started with a major restructuring of the dallas ft 
worth hmo operations of txhc  which included replacement of the senior management  reduction in staffing along with consolidation of certain services to las vegas and a revision of product strategy 
in the second quarter  we implemented another part of the plan by closing certain of our texas clinic facilities and reducing the physician and support staff 
we initiated plans to terminate our contracting relationship with our affiliated medical provider operations in dallas ft 
worth 
we stopped actively marketing our medicare hmo product in texas while we assessed its cost structure 
we then re evaluated our goodwill asset related to our texas operations and determined that future cash flows would be insufficient to recover this asset and we completely wrote off the asset 
we also decided to sell our texas real estate 
the market valuations we received resulted in fixed asset impairment charges of approximately million 
concurrently  our real estate holdings in arizona and one of our underperforming las vegas  nevada clinics were also determined to be impaired based on market valuations  which resulted in fixed asset impairment charges and a re evaluation of goodwill related to our prime holdings  inc acquisition of and a subsequent goodwill impairment charge 
as a result of the asset impairment and other changes in estimate charges we took in the second quarter  we were not in compliance with our bank line of credit facility financial covenants 
we were able to obtain temporary waivers from the banks by paying additional fees  pledging certain assets and having some of our subsidiaries guarantee the credit facility debt  which at june   was million 
while continuing to negotiate with the banks on a new credit agreement  we undertook steps to conserve our cash by delaying non essential capital expenditures and reducing our corporate general and administrative expenses 
we also commenced initiatives to sell our non core assets including the majority of our las vegas real estate in a sale leaseback transaction  our corporate airplane  our corporate residence in utah used to entertain clients and our houston hmo membership 
in the third quarter  we completed the sale of our affiliated medical provider group in dallas ft 
worth and our corporate residence in utah 
in the fourth quarter  we completed the sale of our corporate airplane  the houston hmo membership and the sale leaseback of the majority of our las vegas real estate 
in addition  we were able to renegotiate the credit facility agreement with the banks in december and we are now in compliance with all financial covenants 
we used million of the sale leaseback proceeds to permanently pay down the credit facility debt and at december   our credit facility debt balance was million

net loss income 
year ended december  compared to total operating revenues for increased approximately to billion from billion for medical premium revenues accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in medical premiums as a percentage of total revenues in is primarily due to the increase in specialty product and military contract revenues and a decrease in hmo membership in texas 
continued medical premium revenue growth is principally dependent upon continued enrollment in our products and upon competitive and regulatory factors 
the change in operating revenues was comprised of the following o an increase in medical premiums of million o an increase in military contract revenues of million o an increase in specialty product revenues of million o a decrease in professional fees of million o a decrease in investment and other revenues of million medical premiums from our hmo and managed indemnity insurance subsidiaries increased million or 
the million increase in premium revenue reflects a increase in medicare member months the number of months of each year that an individual is enrolled in a plan offset by a decrease in commercial member months 
the growth in medicare member months contributes significantly to the increase in premium revenues as the medicare per member premium rates are over three times higher than the average commercial premium rate 
hmo premium rates for commercial groups increased approximately in nevada  in dallas ft 
worth and in houston 
our managed indemnity rates increased approximately and medicare rates increased approximately 
over of our las vegas  nevada medicare members are enrolled in the social hmo medicare program 
the health care financing administration  or hcfa  may consider adjusting the reimbursement factor or changing the program for the social hmo members in the future 
if the reimbursement for these members decreases significantly and related benefit changes are not made timely  there could be a material adverse effect on our business 
military contract revenues increased million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to additional accrued bid price adjustment revenues related to a true up of prior periods information received from the government in the third quarter of partially offsetting this was a decrease recorded in the first quarter for a reduction in the at risk health care population of beneficiaries as additional beneficiaries enrolled with military treatment facility primary care managers 
we are not at risk for those tricare eligibles and receive less revenue related to them from the government 
military contract revenue is recorded based on the contract price as agreed to by the federal government  adjusted for certain provisions based on actual experience 
in addition  we record revenue based on estimates of the earned portion of any contract change orders not originally specified in the contract 
specialty product revenues increased million or 
revenue increased in the workers compensation insurance segment by million  which was offset by a slight decrease in administrative services revenue of million 
the increase in the workers compensation insurance segment was primarily due to a larger amount of direct written premiums with an composite increase in premium rates for all states and a increase in production growth 
net earned premiums are the end result of direct written premiums  plus the change in unearned premiums  less premiums ceded to reinsurers 
direct written premiums increased by due primarily to growth in california and nevada 
partially offsetting the growth in direct written premiums was an increase in premiums ceded to reinsurers  which increased by 
the growth in ceded reinsurance premiums was lower than the growth in direct written premiums primarily due to the expiration of our low level reinsurance agreement on june  and new lower cost reinsurance agreements  all of which reduced the percentage of premiums being ceded 
as compared to the low level reinsurance agreement that expired on june   the new lower cost reinsurance agreements result in higher net earned premium revenues  as we retain more of the premium dollars  but also leads to our keeping more of the incurred losses 
this may result in a higher loss and loss adjustment expense  or lae  ratio if the percentage increase in the additional incurred losses should be greater than the percentage increase in the additional premiums we retained 
the effect on the balance sheet will result in a lower amount of reinsurance recoverables 
however  due to the length of time that it typically takes to fully pay a claim  we should see an increase in operating cash flow and amounts available to be invested 
professional fees decreased million or 
the revenue for included the pharmacy operations in texas until they were sold during the fourth quarter of and the inpatient operations at the mohave valley hospital until they were closed during the first quarter of the fees in also reflect staffing reductions and subsequent closure or sale of our affiliated medical groups in texas and arizona 
investment and other revenues decreased million or  due primarily to a decrease in the average invested balance during the year 
medical expenses increased million or 
excluding the effects of changes in estimate charges  medical expenses increased approximately million or 
medical expenses as a percentage of medical premiums and professional fees decreased from to  excluding changes in estimate charges and premium deficiency as described below 
the improvement is primarily due to the closing and sale of operations with higher medical care ratios  primarily in texas and rural nevada  offset by an increase in medicare members as a percentage of fully insured members 
the cost of providing medical care to medicare members generally requires a greater percentage of the premiums received 
medical expenses reported in the first quarter of included million of prior period reserve strengthening 
in the second quarter of  we recorded changes in estimate charges of million for reserve strengthening primarily due to adverse development on prior years medical claims  million in premium deficiency medical expenses for the texas operations and million for other changes in estimate charges 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a premium deficiency medical charge accrual of million related to losses in underperforming markets  primarily in arizona and rural nevada  all of which was used during in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a premium deficiency charge accrual of million for estimated deficient premiums associated with contracts in the texas market of which  million was included in premium deficiency medical expenses and million was recorded in asset impairment  restructuring  reorganization and other costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded changes in estimate charges of million primarily related to an adjustment to the estimate for medical expenses recorded in previous years and million primarily related to contractual settlements with providers of medical services the medical expenses for include the utilization of million of premium deficiency reserve to offset losses on contracts in texas compared to the utilization of million in see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the remaining premium deficiency medical reserve of million  as of december   is adequate and that no revision to the estimate is necessary at this time 
military contract expenses increased million or 
the increase is consistent with the increase in revenues discussed previously 
health care delivery expense consists primarily of costs to provide managed health care services to eligible beneficiaries in accordance with sierra s tricare contract 
under the contract  smhs provides health care services to approximately  dependents of active duty military personnel and military retirees and their dependents through subcontractor partnerships and individual providers 
health care costs are recorded in the period when services are provided to eligible beneficiaries  including estimates for provider costs  which have been incurred but not reported to us 
also  included in military contract expenses are costs incurred to perform specific administrative services  such as health care appointment scheduling  enrollment  network management and health care advice line services  and other administrative functions of the military health care subsidiary 
specialty product expenses increased million or 
of the increase  approximately million is a direct result of the costs associated with the increase in workers compensation premiums and associated loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we recorded net adverse loss development for prior accident years of million in compared to million in the net adverse development recorded in and for prior accident years was largely attributable to higher costs per claim  or claim severity  in california 
higher claim severity has had a negative impact on the entire california workers compensation industry 
the majority of the adverse loss development occurred on accident years that were not covered by our low level reinsurance agreement 
while the low level reinsurance agreement is in run off effective july   california premium rates have been increasing  which we believe will largely mitigate the loss of this very favorable reinsurance protection 
the premium rate increases on policies renewed in california during the year ended december  were approximately and for the second half of the year alone  averaged approximately 
in the first two months of  the average renewal rate increase for our california policies was approximately 
we recorded a higher loss and lae ratio for the accident year  which resulted in an increase of approximately million in specialty product expense 
the majority of the increase is due to the termination of the low level reinsurance agreement on june   which results in a higher risk exposure on policies effective after that date and a higher amount of net incurred loss and lae 
in addition  in light of the lower premium rates on policies written in  inflationary trends in health care costs  the fact that we have seen our reserves develop adversely for the past two years and that projecting ultimate reserves cannot be done with accuracy  we believed it prudent to establish reserves at a higher loss ratio to mitigate any future adverse loss development that may occur 
the loss and lae reserves booked as of december  reflect our best estimate of the ultimate loss costs for reported and unreported claims occurring in accident year as well as those occurring in accident years prior to and is slightly in excess of our independent actuary s estimate 
loss and lae reserves have a significant degree of uncertainty when related to their subsequent payments 
although reserves are established on the basis of a reasonable estimate  it is not only possible but probable that current reserves will differ from their related subsequent developments 
any subsequent change in loss and lae reserves established in a prior year would be reflected in the year when the change is identified 
workers compensation claim payments are made over several years from the date of the claim 
until the final payments for reported claims are made  reserves are invested to generate investment income 
under our low level reinsurance agreement  we reinsure of the first  of each claim  of the next  and of the next  the maximum net loss retained on any one claim ceded under this agreement is  this agreement covered all policies in force at july  and continued until june  when we executed an option to extend coverage to all policies in force as of june  for policies effective from july   we obtained excess of loss reinsurance for of the losses above  and less than  we already had an existing excess of loss reinsurance agreement that covered of the losses above  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the combined ratio is a measurement of underwriting profit or loss and is the sum of the loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio and policyholders dividend ratio 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit 
our combined ratio was compared to for the increase was primarily due to a higher loss and lae ratio of percentage points and policyholders dividend ratio of percentage points  offset slightly by a decrease in the underwriting expense ratio of percentage points 
the increase in the loss and lae ratio was due to an increase in net adverse loss development which represents percentage points of the change in the loss and lae ratio  and a higher loss and lae ratio on the accident year of million  which represents percentage points of the change in the loss and lae ratio 
general  administrative and marketing expenses  or g a  decreased million or 
as a percentage of revenues  g a costs for were compared to in due primarily to higher revenues in as a percentage of medical premium revenue  g a costs improved from for down to for excluding the utilization of premium deficiency reserves for maintenance costs of million for and million for  g a costs decreased million or for the year 
the million decrease was primarily attributable to the consolidation of much of the texas g a services with our existing operations in las vegas as well as overall reductions in the texas operations 
this was offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million 
asset impairment  restructuring  reorganization and other costs consist of the following asset impairments 
during the first quarter of  we closed all inpatient operations at mohave valley hospital  a bed acute care facility in bullhead city  arizona  and terminated over employees 
we recorded a charge of million for the write off of goodwill associated with these operations 
in the first quarter of  we engaged a consultant to help us assess our texas operations 
in late february  the consultant issued its report and we implemented strategic action plans to turn around the texas operations 
these actions included the replacement of the texas senior management  a reduction in staffing along with a consolidation of certain services to las vegas and a revision of product strategy 
the new management was charged with further assessing the dallas ft 
worth health care delivery system 
in may  we decided that the delivery system  which emphasized our affiliated medical group as the primary provider network  would be replaced by an expanded network of contracted physician groups and individuals 
in addition  the contracted hospital network would be significantly expanded 
as a result  during the second quarter of  we adopted and announced a further restructuring of the dallas ft 
worth operations  which entailed a significant reduction of physicians and staff and the closing of several clinic sites 
in addition  management decided that the real estate assets would be sold 
management also adopted a plan in the second quarter of to discontinue medical delivery operations in mohave county  arizona and to sell the real estate assets located there  as well as an underperforming medical clinic in las vegas 
in connection with the restructuring plans we adopted and announced in the second quarter of  we re evaluated the recoverability of certain long lived assets  primarily associated with the texas operations  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas no 
 and accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets  or apb no 
 and determined that the carrying values of certain goodwill and other long lived assets were impaired 
in assessing the asset impairment of the long lived assets  we first allocated a portion of related goodwill to the fixed assets to be disposed of  in accordance with sfas no 
the fixed assets were then written down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell  which was determined from independent valuations 
the remainder of the related goodwill was then assessed for recoverability in accordance with apb no 
based on projected discounted cash flows 
the charges recorded for the write off of goodwill totaled million for the texas operations and million related primarily to the prime holdings  inc acquisition 
the charges recorded for fixed asset impairment totaled million for the texas operations and million for the arizona and nevada operations 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off capitalized costs of million related to the application development of an information system software project for the workers compensation operations  that was canceled because the vendor was unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
the amounts written off included software and consulting costs of million and capitalized internal personnel costs of million 
restructuring and reorganization 
in the first quarter of  we incurred  for certain legal and contractual settlements and  to provide for our portion of the write off of start up costs at our equity investee  triwest healthcare alliance 
in the first quarter of  we announced a restructuring of our managed health care operations in texas 
as a result of this restructuring  we incurred approximately million of severance pay for employees who were terminated 
the restructuring involved changes in senior management at our texas facilities and the centralization of key services to las vegas 
also in the first quarter of  we incurred million of costs  consisting primarily of consulting fees  in conjunction with a review and reorganization of our managed care operations in texas 
in the second quarter of  we adopted a plan and announced additional restructuring of our managed health care operations  primarily in texas and arizona 
as a result of this restructuring  we recorded charges in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring of approximately million 
of the costs recorded  million was for severance  million was related to clinic closures and lease terminations and million was for other costs 
the severance charge resulted from the termination of employees at our subsidiaries and affiliated medical groups 
as compared to the quarter ended june   the restructuring and reorganization activities resulted in cash flow savings of approximately to million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of premium deficiency maintenance 
based on financial projections for  we recorded a million premium deficiency at the end of  relative to our texas operations 
of this amount  million was recorded in medical expenses and million was recorded in asset impairment  restructuring  reorganization and other costs 
the million was an estimate of g a costs  in excess of those covered by premiums  expected to be incurred to service the dallas ft 
worth contracts 
the premium deficiency maintenance costs of million  recorded in the second quarter of  were an estimate of general and administrative costs  in excess of those covered by premiums  we would incur to service the texas contracts 
the amount reflects anticipated cost reductions from the restructuring and reorganization actions noted above 
other 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred settlement expenses totaling million related to the settlement of a competitor s protest for the region tricare contract 
also during the fourth quarter of  we incurred integration  transition and other charges totaling million related primarily to our acquisition of the texas operations of kaiser foundation health plan of texas 
in addition  we incurred certain legal expenses totaling million  resulting primarily from the tricare settlement  acquisition and integration activity 
the million of charges in the fourth quarter of consisted primarily of legal and contractual settlements 
the remaining million of costs recorded in the second quarter of relate primarily to the write down of certain receivables and an accrual for legal settlements

the remaining other costs of million are primarily related to legal claims 
we believe that the remaining reserves as of december  are adequate and that no revisions to the estimates are necessary at this time 
interest expense and other  net increased million or  due primarily to an increase in the average balance of outstanding debt and an increase in the average cost of borrowing 
our average credit facility debt balance was million in compared to million in and our average interest rate on the credit facility was in compared to in benefit for income taxes was recorded at million for compared to a tax benefit of million recorded for during  due to a change in tax law  we were able to utilize a million net operating loss carryover that had previously not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainty about its realization 
the effective tax rate for was compared to for which is exclusive of the effect of the change in tax law described above 
the decrease in tax rate is due primarily to the impact of the charge for goodwill impairment combined with the magnitude of the loss for compared to the difference between the effective tax rate  excluding the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance  and the statutory rate is due primarily to non deductible goodwill amortization 
the effective tax rate for is projected to range from to 
the difference between the anticipated tax rate and the statutory tax rate is due primarily to tax preferred investments offset by state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to total operating revenues for increased approximately to billion from billion for the increase was primarily due to increases in premium revenue of million and military contract revenues of million  offset by a decrease in specialty product revenue of million 
medical premium revenues accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively

medical premiums from the hmo and managed indemnity insurance subsidiaries increased million or 
excluding the effect of the kaiser texas acquisition  premium revenue increased million or

the revenue recorded in is a result of the provision of health care services for twelve months 
revenue recorded in was comprised of revenue earned for five months of contract implementation and seven months of health care delivery 
specialty product revenues decreased million or 
of the decrease  million was due to a decrease in revenue in the workers compensation insurance segment and million was due to a decrease in administrative services revenue 
the decrease in the workers compensation insurance segment was primarily due to a full year of additional ceded reinsurance premiums on the low level reinsurance agreement effective july   totaling million 
this agreement was entered into in the fourth quarter of in addition  ongoing price competition  especially in california  was contributing to the reduction in revenue 
the decrease in administrative services revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in membership 
professional fees increased million or  primarily due to our medical group operations in dallas ft

excluding the effect of the dallas ft 
worth operations  as well as the changes in estimate charges  medical expenses increased million or compared to the prior year 
medical expenses as a percentage of medical premiums and professional fees increased from to  or excluding the changes in estimate charges 
the increase in the medical care ratio reflects the kaiser texas membership  which has a higher medical care ratio  and the charges discussed previously  as well as an increase in medicare members as a percentage of fully insured members  and higher pharmacy costs 
pharmacy costs increased as the management of the pharmacy benefit was transitioned from a capitated pharmacy benefits contract to in house management in the third quarter of the costs under capitation contracts were substantially below actual claims experience

during  workers compensation claims were reinsured between  and million per occurrence 
for claims occurring in that are below  we obtained low level quota share and excess of loss reinsurance 
under this agreement  which was not reflected in the financial statements until the fourth quarter of  we reinsure of the first  of each claim  of the next  and of the next  claims occurring in the third quarter of were accounted for as retroactive reinsurance 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the combined ratio for the workers compensation insurance business was in compared to for the prior year 
the increase was due to a basis point increase in the net loss and lae ratio  a basis point increase in the underwriting expense ratio and basis points of policyholders dividend expense incurred in the increase in the loss and lae ratio was primarily due to net adverse loss development of million on prior accident years compared to net favorable loss development of million 
the increase in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily due to the lower net earned premium base that resulted from higher ceded reinsurance premiums in the adverse development recorded in for the prior accident years was primarily attributable to increased california claim severity 
higher claim severity has had a negative impact on the entire california workers compensation industry 
the historical claim frequency development patterns have not significantly changed in in addition  continuing price competition in california has negatively affected operating ratios 
general  administrative and marketing expenses  or g a  increased million or 
as a percentage of revenues  g a costs for were  which was consistent with of the million increase in g a  million was due to additional g a related to the acquired hmo business in the dallas ft

liquidity and capital resources we had cash in flows from operating activities of million for the year ended december  compared to cash out flows of million in the improvement over is primarily attributable to cash from earnings and the change in assets and liabilities 
the increase in cash flow resulting from the change in assets and liabilities of million was primarily due to the following o a source of cash due to the increase in reserve for loss and lae of million in our workers compensation business o a source of cash due to the increase in medical claims payable  including military claims  of million as a result of the overall increase in medical premiums and military contract revenues o a source of cash due to the decrease in other current assets of million o a use of cash due to the increase in the deferred tax asset of million o a use of cash due to the increase in reinsurance recoverable of million primarily in our workers compensation business o a use of cash due to the decrease in other liabilities of million primarily related to the decrease in the deferred tax liability o a use of cash due to an increase in military accounts receivable of million o various other changes in assets and liabilities accounting for the remaining source of cash of million smhs receives monthly cash payments equivalent to one twelfth of its annual contractual price with the department of defense  or dod 
smhs accrues health care revenue on a monthly basis for any monies owed above its monthly cash receipt based on the number of at risk eligible beneficiaries and the level of military direct care system utilization 
the contractual bid price adjustment  or bpa  process serves to adjust the dod s monthly payments to smhs  because the payments are based in part on dod estimates for beneficiary population and beneficiary population baseline health care cost  inflation and military direct care system utilization 
as actual information becomes available for the above items  quarterly adjustments are made to smhs monthly health care payment in addition to lump sum adjustments for past months 
in addition  smhs accrues change order revenue for dod directed contract changes 
during the second and fourth quarters of  smhs received million and million  respectively  as partial payments from the bpa process covering the period june  through december  as a result of preliminary data accumulated from the bpa process  smhs received a partial upward adjustment of approximately million to its monthly dod payments for january through december our business and cash flows could be adversely affected if the timing or amount of the bpa and change order reimbursements vary significantly from our expectations 
smhs is in the process of finalizing a financing arrangement for its accounts receivable balance in order to improve the availability of cash 
the military accounts receivable balance was million as of december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during january  smhs reached an agreement with dod on a settlement of million related to contract modifications issued prior to july  smhs received an immediate payment of million for outstanding receivables and the remainder of the settlement is to be paid evenly on a monthly basis until the end of the contract 
of the total settlement  smhs estimates that approximately million is owed to subcontractors 
net cash used for investing activities during included million in capital expenditures associated with continued implementation of new computer systems  as well as construction  furniture  equipment and other capital needs to support our growth  offset by net proceeds of million for property and equipment dispositions 
the net cash change in investments for the year was a decrease of million as investments were sold to fund working capital needs 
cash flows from financing activities included net proceeds from long term borrowings proceeds less payments of million and proceeds of million related to the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
on december   we sold the majority of our las vegas real estate holdings in a sale leaseback transaction 
the transaction was recorded as a financing obligation of million offset by mortgage notes receivable of million  a payoff of related real estate mortgages of million and a permanent reduction on our revolving credit facility of million for a net increase in liabilities of million 
revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility balance decreased from million to million during the year 
as a result of the asset impairment and other changes in estimate charges we took in the second quarter  we were not in compliance with our financial covenants at june  on december   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement and have been in compliance with all covenants since that date 
at december   the credit facility was reduced to million as a result of our payment of million that we received from the sale leaseback transaction 
we are required to make semi annual principal payments  ranging from million to million  on the credit facility starting in june these payments result in permanent reductions in the size of the credit facility 
interest under the credit facility is variable and is based on the bank of america prime rate plus a margin 
the rate was at december  which is a combination of the prime rate of plus a margin of 
we can reduce the margin in the future by completing certain transactions and meeting certain financial ratios 
of the outstanding balance  million is covered by an interest rate swap agreement 
to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuation on the credit facility  we entered into a five year million interest rate swap agreement during the fourth quarter of the intent of the agreement was to keep our interest rate on million of the borrowing relatively fixed 
in the fourth quarter of  million of the interest rate swap agreement was terminated 
the average cost of borrowing on this credit facility for  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreements  was approximately 
going forward  under certain circumstances  we will be required to make prepayments on the credit facility and the amount available to us under the credit facility will be reduced 
for example  of any excess cash flow that we have in each year must be applied to a repayment of the credit facility 
in addition  if we or one of our subsidiaries other than a regulated subsidiary and other specified subsidiaries engage in an asset sale or a sale leaseback transaction with the exception of assets specified in the new credit agreement  of the net cash proceeds must be applied to a repayment of the credit facility and a reduction of the amount available under the credit facility 
in addition  of the net cash proceeds of a debt issuance excluding issuances by cii financial  a wholly owned subsidiary must be applied to a repayment of the credit facility and a reduction in the amount available under the credit facility 
we are also limited in the amount of funds we can transfer to our texas and military operations with a maximum of million and million  respectively 
subject to normal qualifications and exceptions  sierra and cii financial have covenants that  among other things  will restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  or make capital expenditures and which otherwise restrict certain corporate activities 
at february   our credit facility had outstanding borrowings of million 
unused credit facility balances are primarily reserved for our working capital purposes 
any availability under the credit facility generated from our excess cash flow must be converted annually to permanent reductions in accordance with the terms of the credit facility 
convertible subordinated debentures in september  cii financial  inc  or cii  the workers compensation holding company  issued convertible subordinated debentures 
as of december   million in debentures were outstanding 
the debentures pay interest at per annum  which is due semi annually on march and september  and mature september  each  in principal is convertible into shares of common stock of sierra at a conversion price of per share 
the debentures have no financial ratio covenants 
the primary covenants include the timely payment of principal  premium  interest and taxes 
other covenants include cii s agreement to maintain their existence  business properties and an office where the debentures can be surrendered for payment  transfer or conversion 
there are also covenants regarding cii s offering to purchase the debentures upon specified non approved mergers and changes in control 
since our acquisition of cii was approved by cii s board of directors and shareholders  we were not required to offer to purchase the debentures 
the debentures are obligations of cii only and are not guaranteed by us 
cii is a holding company and its only significant asset is its investment in california indemnity insurance company 
of the million in cash and cash equivalents it held at december   approximately million were designated for use only by the regulated insurance companies 
cii has limited sources of cash and is dependent upon dividends paid by california indemnity 
the payment of stockholders dividends by california indemnity is regulated by the california insurance code and  at a minimum  requires a workday prior notice to the california department of insurance 
if a payment of a dividend or distribution whose fair market value  together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of ten percent of the insurer s surplus or its net income for the preceding year end  then the insurance commissioner has up to days to disapprove it 
the california insurance department will not allow a payment of a dividend or distribution if it will cause an insurer s policyholders surplus to be unreasonable in relation to the insurer s liabilities and the adequacy of the insurer s financial needs 
in making this determination  the department of insurance considers a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the size of the insurer  the amount  type and geographic concentration of insurance it writes  the quality of its assets and reinsurance programs  and operating trends 
in addition  california law provides that an insurer may not pay a dividend without the prior approval of the state insurance commissioner to the extent the cumulative amount of dividends or distributions paid or proposed to be paid in any year exceeds the amount shown as unassigned funds reduced by any unrealized gains included in such amount on the insurer s statutory statement as of the previous december as of december   california indemnity had unassigned funds of  from which it could pay a dividend without prior approval 
california indemnity declared and paid no dividends to cii financial in but paid million of dividends to it in and million in we advanced cii  in order to enable them to make the september  interest payment on the debentures 
our amended and restated bank credit facility will limit our ability to make any future advances to cii 
since we do not believe that cii will have sufficient readily available sources of cash to pay the maturing debentures  cii has filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and is proposing to exchange the debentures for a combination of cash and or new senior subordinated debentures 
the sources for the cash portion of the proposed exchange offer include a dividend by california indemnity to cii of up to million 
on february   the california department of insurance approved the payment by california indemnity of an extraordinary dividend of up to million 
cii will depend on loans from us and or other affiliates for the balance of the cash portion of the exchange consideration 
however  these types of loans are limited by our credit facility 
in addition  in order to issue the new senior subordinated debentures in the proposed exchange offer  we will need the consent of a two thirds majority in principal amount of the lenders under our credit facility 
on march   cii announced that the interest payment due march  on the debentures was not made as scheduled 
the debentures have a day grace period that applies to the scheduled march interest payment and are not in default unless payment is not made during the grace period 
cii is working to complete the proposed exchange offer 
if the proposed exchange offer is unsuccessful and cii were to default on the payment of interest or the debentures when they mature  then there will be a cross default on our credit facility debt and the banks may demand that cii perform on its payment guaranty 
if cii then had to sell its insurance subsidiaries  the net cash proceeds would probably be substantially less than if the sale were to occur when they were not in a default situation 
under certain circumstances  the california department of insurance could  among other things  exercise its oversight powers to preserve the assets of the insurance companies for the benefit of the policyholders and claimants and could prevent or significantly delay a possible sale of the insurance subsidiaries 
cii s only significant short term non insurance liquidity need is the repayment of the million in debentures  which are due on september  as discussed above 
if the proposed exchange offer for the debentures is successful and cii financial issues new senior subordinated debentures with an extended maturity date  then their long term non insurance liquidity needs will be to service this new debt 
cii financial expects to service this new debt from future cash flows  primarily from dividends that will be paid by their insurance subsidiaries from their future earnings 
statutory capital and deposit requirements our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain certain deposits and must also meet certain net worth and reserve requirements 
the hmo and insurance subsidiaries had restricted assets on deposit in various states totaling million at december  the hmo and insurance subsidiaries must also meet requirements to maintain minimum stockholders equity  on a statutory basis  as well as minimum risk based capital requirements  which are determined annually 
additionally  in conjunction with the kaiser texas acquisition  txhc entered into a letter agreement with the texas department of insurance whereby txhc agreed to maintain a net worth of million  on a statutory basis 
of the million in cash and cash equivalents held at december   million was designated for use only by the regulated subsidiaries 
amounts are available for transfer to the holding company from the hmo and insurance subsidiaries only to the extent that they can be remitted in accordance with the terms of existing management agreements and by dividends 
the holding company will not receive dividends from its regulated subsidiaries if such dividend payment would cause violation of statutory net worth and reserve requirements 
other we have a capital budget of million as limited by our revolving credit facility 
the planned expenditures are primarily for the expansion of clinics and other leased facilities  the purchase of computer hardware and software  furniture and equipment and other normal capital requirements 
our liquidity needs over the next months will primarily be for the capital items noted above  debt service and expansion of our operations 
we believe that our existing working capital  operating cash flow and  if necessary  equipment leasing  divestitures of certain non core assets  restructuring of the convertible subordinated debentures and amounts available under our credit facility should be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and debt service 
additionally  subject to unanticipated cash requirements  we believe that our existing working capital and operating cash flow should enable us to meet our liquidity needs on a long term basis 
in the second quarter of  our board of directors authorized a million line of credit from us to our chief executive officer  or ceo 
in april  our board of directors authorized an additional million loan from us to the ceo 
the entire principal balance along with accrued interest is due on june  at the end of  the aggregate principal balance outstanding and accrued interest for both instruments was million 
all amounts borrowed bear interest at a rate equal to the rate at which we could have borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility at the time of the borrowing plus basis points 
the amounts outstanding are collateralized by certain of the ceo s assets and rights to compensation from us 
inflation health care costs continue to rise at a rate faster than the consumer price index 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation  including setting commercial premiums based on our anticipated health care costs  risk sharing arrangements with our various health care providers and other health care cost containment measures including member co payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future  our ability to manage medical costs will not be negatively impacted by items such as technological advances  competitive pressures  applicable regulations  increases in pharmacy costs  utilization changes and catastrophic items  which could  in turn  result in medical cost increases equaling or exceeding premium increases 
government regulation our business  offering health care coverage  health care management services  workers compensation programs and  to a lesser extent  the delivery of medical services  is heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels 
government regulation of health care coverage products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  including legislative proposals to eliminate or reduce erisa pre emption of state laws  that would increase potential litigation exposure and interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change from time to time 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion in promulgating regulations and in interpreting and enforcing laws and regulations 
while we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or the impact on us of any particular change  our operations and financial results could be negatively affected by regulatory revisions 
for example  any proposals affecting underwriting practices  limiting rate increases  increasing litigation exposure  requiring new or additional benefits or affecting contracting arrangements including proposals to require hmos and ppos to accept any health care providers willing to abide by an hmo s or ppo s contract terms may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the continued consideration and enactment of anti managed care laws and regulations by federal and state bodies may make it more difficult for us to manage medical costs and may adversely affect financial results 
in addition to changes in applicable laws and regulations  we are subject to various audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to the erisa  which regulates insured and self insured health coverage plans offered by employers  the federal employees health benefit plan  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and laws relating to utilization management and the delivery of health care 
any such government action could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which  as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes additional accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position 
this statement also defines and allows companies to apply hedge accounting to its designated derivatives under certain instances 
it also requires that all derivatives be marked to market on an ongoing basis 
this applies whether the derivatives are stand alone instruments  such as warrants or interest rate swaps  or embedded derivatives  such as call options contained in convertible debt investments 
along with the derivatives  in the case of qualifying hedges  the underlying hedged items are also to be marked to market 
these market value adjustments are to be included either in the income statement or other comprehensive income  depending on the nature of the hedged transaction 
the fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over the counter market 
in cases where derivatives relate to financial instruments of non public companies  or where quoted market prices are otherwise not available  such as for derivative financial instruments  fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
we do not believe that we have any significant derivative instruments or any significant hedging activities 
the majority of our investments are held by insurance companies  which are regulated as to the types of investments they may hold 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab clarifies existing accounting principles related to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we were required to comply with the provisions of sab in our quarter ended december  and it did not have any impact on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current  long term and restricted investments 
of the investments  approximately million is classified as available for sale investments and million is classified as held to maturity investments 
these investments are primarily in fixed income  investment grade securities 
our investment policy emphasizes return of principal and liquidity and is focused on fixed returns that limit volatility and risk of principal 
because of our investment policies  the primary market risk associated with our portfolio is interest rate risk 
assuming interest rates were to increase by a factor of  the net hypothetical loss in fair value of stockholders equity related to financial instruments is estimated to be approximately million after tax of total stockholders equity 
we believe that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows  as it is unlikely that we would need or choose to substantially liquidate our investment portfolio 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term net income  cash flow and fair value was determined based on commonly used interest rate sensitivity analyses 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors  including duration and prepayment 
fair value was estimated based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  assuming an immediate increase in interest rates 
because duration is estimated  rather than a known quantity  for certain securities  other market factors may impact security valuations and there can be no assurance that our portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit facility 
the average cost of borrowing on this credit facility for  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreements  was approximately 
if the average cost of borrowing on the amount outstanding as of december  were to increase by a factor of  annual income before tax would decrease by approximately million 
as of december   cii had convertible subordinated debentures outstanding of  of which  were held by sierra health services  inc and is eliminated on consolidation 
purchase activity for the debentures  to parties other than cii or sierra  is believed to be minimal and there is no known market quotation system for the debentures 
the fair value of the debentures at december  and was estimated to be  and  respectively 
the december  value is our best estimate and was based on  stated value debentures that we purchased for  in september and may not be indicative of the actual market value since we are not aware of any other recent debenture purchases or market quotes 
the december  price is based on the estimated market price on december  if interest rates were to fluctuate by a factor of  we do not anticipate a material change in the fair value of the debentures based on the current market for them 
our outstanding financing obligations related to the sale leaseback transaction are not publicly traded and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates
