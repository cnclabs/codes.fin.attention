item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of organogenesis inc organogenesis inc a tissue engineering company designs  develops and manufactures medical products containing living cells and or natural connective tissue 
we are the developer and manufacturer of the only mass produced product containing living human cells to gain fda marketing approval 
our product development focus includes living tissue replacements  a cell based organ assist device and other tissue engineered products 
our lead product  apligraf our lead product  apligraf living skin substitute  gained fda marketing approval for use in the treatment of healing resistant venous leg ulcers in in june  apligraf was approved for use in the treatment of healing resistant diabetic foot ulcers 
novartis pharma ag novartis has exclusive global apligraf marketing rights 
in addition to being marketed in the us  apligraf is also available in select international markets 
novartis expects to submit for marketing approval across the european union in the spring of our pipeline our research and development pipeline includes a living dermal replacement product candidate  vitrix  which we anticipate beginning human pivotal clinical trials in spring  a coronary vascular graft and a liver assist device 
additionally  a business unit technology ventures has been formed to commercialize  through partnerships and distributorships  our engineered collagen and conditioned medium technologies 
results of operations we are currently at low volume production as apligraf has  to date  shown a gradual ramp up in sales 
we expect production costs to exceed product sales for at least the next months due to the high costs associated with low volume production 
we expect production volume to increase due to recent medicare progress with coverage for apligraf  fda approval of apligraf for use in diabetic foot ulcers and expanded novartis sales and marketing support 
revenues sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  was issued in december and summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of  effective january   and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to all up front non refundable research and development support payments recognized in prior periods of  of this amount   was recognized as revenue in  and the remainder will be recognized ratably through december  in accordance with sab s guidance 
total revenues for the years  and consisted of research  development and milestone support from related party   product sales to related party    research and development grants   other revenues    in  research  development and milestone support from related party of  includes a  milestone payment related to the diabetic foot ulcer indication and  of deferred revenue recognized in the current year 
no such revenues were earned in in  we received  of payments primarily related to the venous leg ulcer indication 
the increase in product sales to related party over the last three years is due to increased unit sales of apligraf to novartis 
we expect apligraf commercial sales to continue to increase 
research and development grants revenue increased primarily due to a full year of grant work performed during compared to one month performed during and no grants in refer to the grant section under the commitments footnote to the financial statements for a full description 
other revenues decreased in and increased in  primarily due to changes in the level of novartis funding for publication study programs 
total revenues for the years and have not been adjusted for the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
costs and expenses cost of product sales to related party our cost of product sales was  in  compared to  in these expenses increased due to higher unit sales of apligraf to novartis and a higher amount of fixed costs due to infrastructure increases needed to support anticipated future higher unit volume levels 
cost of product sales includes the direct costs to manufacture and package apligraf and an allocation of our production related indirect costs 
all costs of production prior to were included in research and development expense due to insignificant commercial sales and low production volume associated with early stage commercialization 
cost of product sales exceeded product sales due to the high costs associated with low volume production 
we expect production volume to increase and our margins to improve in we expect that we will have to revise standard costs and the allocation of costs to product sales in the future as we continue to modify our manufacturing processes 
research and development research and development expenses r d consist of costs associated with research  development  clinical  process development  facilities and engineering support excluding the allocation of our production related indirect costs 
these expenses decreased to  for from  in and  in the decrease in versus was primarily due to a decrease in clinical related costs due to completion of the apligraf diabetic foot ulcer pivotal trial partially off set by an increase in operations support for supplies  personnel costs  and increases in depreciation expense on significant leasehold improvements put into service during the increase in versus was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs  outside services  supplies  and occupancy costs to support our ongoing programs  including vitrix and the liver assist device  and costs to support publications studies and other sponsored programs 
this was partially off set by a decrease in clinical related costs because included non recurring expenses related to fda approval and because the apligraf diabetic foot ulcer pivotal trial was at its peak  and by a decrease in operating related expenditures 
process development  facilities and engineering support expenses included in research and development were   and  for the periods  and  respectively 
we expect that our r d expenses will increase moderately during included in r d for is a non cash charge of  relating to the purchase of incomplete technology to be used specifically in our liver assist device research and development efforts refer to the commitments footnote to the financial statements for a full description of this technology 
the purchase was made to strengthen our resources and intellectual property position 
the charge to expense was due to the early stage of the technology that had not provided proof of principle 
additionally  the time and cost to prove this principle was not known 
we expect it will cost millions of dollars and take a minimum of to years before we could develop a product which might be approved for commercial sale 
it is our intent that if proof of principle is established  we will seek a partnership for this project 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses g a include the costs of our corporate  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
these expenses were  for   for and  for the decrease was primarily due to decreased personnel costs and professional service fees 
the increase from  in was primarily due to personnel additions and increased outside professional fees  occupancy costs and consolidating administrative facilities  and the estimated fair value of warrants issued relating to a consulting contract 
we expect that our g a expenses will decrease during as we expect to use less outside services 
other income and expense interest income increased primarily due to the increase in funds available for investment 
interest expense increased to  for compared to  in  primarily due to a full year of convertible debenture and term loan interest in compared to interest expense was  for due to the issuance of convertible debentures in march net loss we incurred a net loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  or per share basic and diluted and a net loss effected for the change in accounting principle of  or per share basic and diluted for  compared to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted for and a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted for cumulative effect of change in accounting principle sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  was issued in december and summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of  effective january   and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to all up front non refundable research and development support payments recognized in prior periods of  or per share basic and diluted for  with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue which will be recognized in future periods 
the impact of adopting sab is not reflected in the amounts presented in the results of operations for the years ended december  and see financial statements and related notes for additional details related to this change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources funds used in operations at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in the aggregate amount of  and working capital of  compared to  and  respectively  at december  working capital increased in due primarily to the excess of financings over operating cash flows 
cash equivalents consist of money market funds  which are highly liquid and have original maturities of less than three months 
investments consist of securities that have an a or a rating or better with a maximum maturity of two years 
cash used in operating activities was  in  compared to  in  primarily for financing our ongoing research  development and manufacturing operations  offset by  cash received from novartis in for achievement of a milestone related to the diabetic foot ulcer indication 
capital spending capital expenditures were  and  during and  respectively  primarily related to the further build out of existing facilities to support apligraf manufacturing  as well as the acquisition of equipment for research and development programs and manufacturing 
we will continue to utilize funds during to expand our existing facility in the areas of apligraf manufacturing  packaging and other process development improvement programs  including funds which we will receive from novartis to upgrade our manufacturing facility and for the facility investment needed for approval and sale of apligraf in the european union 
novartis support payments during march  we received  from novartis  which represented a support payment received in advance of achievement of a milestone related to the diabetic foot ulcer indication 
in june  we recognized support revenue when achievement of the milestone was met upon fda approval of apligraf for use in diabetic foot ulcers 
we did not receive any support payments from novartis in and received equity and support payments totaling  in refer to the related party transactions and other agreements footnote to the financial statements for a full description 
financing from inception  we have financed our operations substantially through private and public placements of equity securities and convertible debt  as well as the receipt of research  development and milestone support payments and contract revenues  interest income from investments  sale of products and receipt of royalties 
during  financing activities provided cash of  primarily from the sale of common stock that generated net proceeds of  and the exercise of stock options that generated  partially offset by the redemption of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock in cash for  and payment of a term loan for  financing activities provided cash of  during from the sale of convertible debentures and warrants to purchase common stock that generated net proceeds of  the issuance of a term loan that generated proceeds of  and the exercise of stock options of  offset by the purchase of treasury stock totaling  during march  we redeemed in cash shares of series c convertible preferred stock representing all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock  for approximately  on february   the securities and exchange commission declared effective a shelf registration for the placement of up to  shares of common stock with an aggregate offering price not to exceed  in february and march  we completed private placements for  shares of common stock under this shelf registration yielding net proceeds of approximately  in december  the board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for up to  additional shares 
subsequent to december   we repurchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  the stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time 
liquidity based upon our current plans  we believe existing working capital at december   together with the proceeds of product and other revenues in and proceeds available from exercising a portion or all of a  equity security put with novartis  which is at our discretion  will be sufficient to finance operations through at least the first quarter of we expect to raise additional funds in through equity financing 
however  this statement is forward looking and changes may occur that would significantly decrease available cash before such time 
factors that may change our cash requirements include 
sales volume forecasts not achieved  
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals of products in different countries  if needed  and subsequent timing of product launches  
delays in commercial acceptance and reimbursement when product launches occur  
changes in the progress of research and development programs  and 
changes in the resources devoted to outside research collaborations or projects  self funded projects  proprietary manufacturing methods and advanced technologies 
any of these events could adversely impact our capital resources  requiring us to raise additional funds 
management believes that additional funds may be available through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners  capital lease arrangements  or other sources of financing in the future 
there can be no assurances that these funds will be available when required on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we would need to delay  scale back or eliminate certain research and development programs or license to third parties certain products or technologies that we would otherwise undertake ourselves  resulting in a potential adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
taxes at december   we had federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  these losses and tax credits are available to reduce federal and state taxable income and income taxes  respectively  in future years  if any 
however  the realizability of deferred tax assets is not assured as it depends upon future taxable income 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against these assets 
we are required to recognize all or a portion of net deferred tax assets  with corresponding increases to net income  when we believe  given the weight of all available evidence  that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other credits will be realized 
however  there can be no assurance that we will ever realize any future cash flows or benefits from these losses and tax credits 
ownership changes  as defined in internal revenue code  may result in future limitations on the utilization of net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income 
impact of inflation although it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation on our costs and revenues in connection with our products  we do not anticipate that inflation will materially impact our costs of operation or the profitability of our products when marketed 
impact of new accounting pronouncement in june of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
we will adopt sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
in to date  we have not utilized derivative instruments or hedging activities and  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the exposure of market risk associated with risk sensitive instruments is not material  as our sales are transacted primarily in united states dollars  invest primarily in money market funds and have not entered into hedging transactions
