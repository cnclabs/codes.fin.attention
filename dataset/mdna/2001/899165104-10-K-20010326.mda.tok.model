item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview since our founding in november  we have been engaged in the discovery and development of a broad range of novel  orally available drugs  most of which act through the regulation of gene expression 
our research programs include cancer  cmv disease  inflammation  immune disorders  lipid disorders  diabetes  bacterial diseases and obesity 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we expand our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  non equity payments from collaborators  capital lease financings and interest income 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we received aggregate research funding under research and development collaborations between and as follows year ended december  in millions research funding received we expect our sources of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist primarily of payments under corporate collaborations and interest income 
the process of developing our products will require significant additional research and development  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approval 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we will not receive product revenue unless we or our collaborative partners complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize one or more of our products 
in order to accelerate product commercialization and finance research activities  we are currently engaged in collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies as summarized below collaborator research area commencement date japan tobacco metabolic diseases june knoll obesity november ending october  japan tobacco lipid disorders september roche bioscience inflammation july japan tobacco obesity diabetes september under the terms of the collaborations identified above and taking into consideration knoll s decision to terminate the obesity program effective october   as of december   our partners had agreed to provide future research funding of up to approximately million over a five year period as set forth in the table below  including million subject to possible cancellation  as well as additional payments upon the achievement of specific research and development milestones and royalties upon commercialization of any products 
research funding expected to be received in the future under existing collaborations was as follows as of december  year ended december  in millions contractual future research funding if we do not enter into new corporate collaborations  collaborative research and development revenue and cash received from collaborative partners will decline for the foreseeable future 
license agreement effective september   we executed a license agreement with eli lilly under which we obtained an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to make  use and sell pharmaceutical products containing a compound that we refer to as t and that was formerly known as lometrexol 
in connection with this agreement  we paid million to eli lilly as an initial license fee and agreed to pay specified milestones and royalties upon successful commercialization of t under the agreement  eli lilly granted us a license to its proprietary technology relating to t and also a sublicense under an exclusive license granted to eli lilly by princeton university relating to t eli lilly has specified obligations under the agreement to maintain the license from princeton university 
eli lilly has a right to match the material terms of any offer made by a third party for commercialization rights relating to t products 
we may terminate the agreement with eli lilly upon written notice 
eli lilly may terminate our license in specified major countries if we fail to use reasonable diligence to develop t products in these countries  and may terminate the agreement if we fail to use appropriate diligence to develop t products in a predetermined number of major countries 
if eli lilly terminates the agreement  eli lilly obtains a nonexclusive  royalty bearing  worldwide license to our technical improvements to t at the date of the license agreement  t had completed the first of three phases of clinical trials required to seek regulatory approval from the fda 
no trials had been commenced that could have demonstrated  with statistical significance  the effectiveness of t as a treatment for any type of cancer 
these trials  necessary to establish the technological feasibility of t  will not be completed for at least several years 
in addition  t has no known alternative future uses 
accordingly  the initial license payment was allocated to acquired in process research and development and expensed at the time of the agreement 
results of operations years ended december   and collaborative research and development revenue 
collaborative research and development revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in was principally attributable to revenue from a new corporate collaboration agreement in the area of metabolic diseases signed in june with japan tobacco 
the effect of this new agreement was partially offset by the conclusion of the collaborations with taisho and sumitomo during the first quarter of the increase in was principally attributable to revenue from new corporate collaboration agreements signed in the second half of these included agreements with japan tobacco in the area of lipid disorders and with knoll in obesity 
the effect of these new agreements was partially offset by lower revenue from the collaboration with merck  which ended in march unless we enter into new corporate collaborations  we expect collaborative research and development revenue to decline for the foreseeable future as the knoll collaboration terminates and other existing collaborations expire at the end of their terms 
research and development expenses 
excluding deferred compensation  research and development expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in is primarily due to increased preclinical and clinical studies and related manufacturing costs 
in addition  new research in metabolic diseases contributed to higher research and development costs in the second half of compared to the second half of the increase in was primarily attributable to increases in employee costs  pre clinical and clinical costs and higher occupancy costs associated with our second building at our south san francisco facility that we occupied in january we also incurred a million expense for in process research and development in the fourth quarter of in connection with the license agreement we executed with eli lilly for t in september we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in future periods  particularly as new and existing product candidates advance into later stages of development 
additionally  we expect that corporate collaborations will fund a smaller percentage of our research and development expenses than historically 
general and administrative expenses 
excluding deferred compensation  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in these increases reflected higher employee costs associated with growth of most functional areas in support of our expanding research and development activities 
the increase in is primarily due to non cash  stock based consultant compensation  higher patent legal expenses and the increased costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
during this three year period  general and administrative expenses increased an aggregate compared with a growth in research and development expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued growth of our research and development efforts and to accommodate the demands associated with operating as a public company 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in  million in and  in we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in and  in for options awarded to employees with exercise prices below the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
we reduced deferred stock compensation by  in to reflect the cancellation of unvested stock option shares from certain and awards 
interest income  net 
net interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase was due primarily to higher interest bearing balances as a result of our public offerings in december and march as compared to balances in the decrease was due primarily to lower interest bearing balances and lower interest rates as compared to liquidity and capital resources since inception  our primary sources of funds have been the sale of equity securities  capital lease financings  non equity payments from collaborators and interest income 
as of december   we had received net proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities  including million from collaborators  million from our initial public offering in december and million from our public offering in march non equity payments received from collaborators since our inception were million through december  aggregate interest income earned since our inception was million through december  we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million at december   an increase of million from december  cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million 
cash used for purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements totaled million during the year ended december  cash received from equipment financing during the year ended december  was million 
the annual interest rates of these financings ranged from to  and the financing arrangements have terms of approximately four years each 
as of december   we had million available under equipment financing arrangements  which we expect to utilize in repayments of long term obligations totaled million during the year ended december  cash received from stock option exercises during the year ended december  was million 
we expect operating spending to increase in the future as we expand operations to support the development of new and existing product candidates 
capital spending is not expected to increase from levels substantially as increases in equipment spending are offset by a reduction in spending resulting from the completion in of leasehold improvements in our second building 
during the three year period ended december   cash used in operating and investing activities was million and million  respectively 
uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund net losses 
uses of cash in investing activities included million used for net purchases of available for sale securities  million for capital expenditures and million for purchases of long term and restricted investments 
financing activities provided cash of million during the three year period ended december  this amount largely represented proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from existing collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through mid we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our pre clinical and clinical development activities  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to establish and maintain current and new collaboration and licensing arrangements  our ability to achieve our milestones and receive funding under collaboration arrangements  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve for at least several years  we expect to finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaborations and debt financing as well as interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot assure you that additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
you should read note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally limited to our cash equivalents and investments that have maturities of less than two years and two equity investments resulting from private investments that converted into publicly traded common shares 
we maintain an investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are therefore subject to interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest
