average borrowings outstanding on the variable rate credit facility with california bank trust after july  was million 
based on actual borrowings  a increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense on the company s variable interest rate debt by approximately  a substantial part of the company s revenue and capital expenditures are transacted in us dollars  but the functional currency for foreign subsidiaries is not the us dollar 
as a result of the company or its subsidiaries entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  the company recognized a foreign currency remeasurement gain of  during the year ended december  the company enters into foreign forward exchange contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts are largely offset by gains or losses on the underlying transactions and  consequently  a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates should not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
the company is likely to be subject to increased foreign currency transactions and associated risks of depreciation of value and volatility of cashflows following the acquisitions of ideal  rdi  fti and tenex data 
to the extent the company is unable to manage these risks  the company s results and financial position could be materially adversely affected
