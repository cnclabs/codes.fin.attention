results of operations net income late in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a repositioning of its balance sheet within the mortgage banking component of the company s operations to facilitate a strengthening of the overall credit quality within the loan portfolio  to allow for a reduction of the company s wholesale funding and to balance more evenly the level of interest rate risk between loans  deposits  and other funding vehicles 
this repositioning primarily involves the transfer of the mortgage banking segment s mortgage loan portfolio to a larger bank affiliate  subject to regulatory approval 
in addition  approximately million of subprime  out of market mortgage loans were reclassified as held for sale in december the sale of these loans was completed in february  and the company no longer originates these types of loans 
the recognition of an increased provision for loan losses for these types of loans and the difference between the book value and market value of the loans transferred to held for sale had a significant impact on earnings 
net income for was  or per share as compared to net income of  or per share 
net income for was  or per share compared to  or per share reported for an increase in net interest income and an expansion of the company s insurance operation were primarily responsible for the increased net income in these increases were partially offset by an increase in loan loss provision and higher personnel costs 
net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income in declined  or from results while net interest income increased  or over net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
for the net interest margin was compared with for and for the company s net interest margin declined in and  as did net interest income in the decline in net interest margin resulted from a combination of flat loan yields and loan growth  and increased costs of wholesale funding to offset declines in core deposits 
wholesale funding represented a total of of total funding sources for compared with of funding sources for further  the mortgage banking division s use of wholesale funding sources in a rising interest rate environment reduced the division s net interest margin by approximately basis points in compared with also contributing to the increased cost of funds was the general rise in interest rates during the latter half of and first half of the company s employment of various asset growth strategies during late and throughout also contributed to the decline in the net interest margin 
these asset growth strategies consisted of affiliate banks investing proceeds from fhlb borrowings in investment securities in order to more effectively utilize capital in excess of requirements 
while these strategies increased the dollar amount of net interest income  they have net interest margins ranging from to  and thus reduce the overall net interest margin percentage 
the increase in net interest income during was largely attributable to loan growth 
while net interest income increased the net interest margin declined 
the decline in net interest margin was attributable to a more competitive pricing environment for loans and deposits and an increased reliance on wholesale funding sources

provision for loan losses the company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses  which totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
these provisions were made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
the increase in provision in was due to an increase in charge off experience in the mortgage division s sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loan portfolio and overall loan growth throughout the company 
the increase in resulted from loan growth and an increase in the allowance for the mortgage division s sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loan portfolio 
as discussed previously  the company sold its subprime  out of market residential real estate portfolio in february  and the company no longer originates these types of loans 
a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management  the results of which will be used to determine provisions for loan losses

non interest expense non interest expense increased  or in following an increase of  or during the increase in resulted largely from increased personnel costs  merger and acquisition related expenses and collection costs primarily associated with the subprime  out of market residential loan portfolio

these facilities were completed and placed into service in the latter half of and first half of also contributing to the increases was the continued implementation of a wide area network and associated operating and application systems at the retail banking affiliates 
these systems are expected to provide long term benefits with regard to improved quality of customer service and control of personnel expenses  and in some cases were in preparation for the year professional fees increased in due in large part to merger and acquisition activities in during  professional fees declined 
a significant portion of the costs associated with acquisitions completed in early was expensed during  resulting in the lower level of professional fees in advertising and promotion expenses declined in following an increase of in increases in were attributable to the introduction of the corporate identity program at new affiliates and to the implementation of a customer information system for all banking affiliates

provision for income taxes the company records a provision for current income taxes payable  along with a provision for deferred taxes payable in the future 
deferred taxes arise from temporary differences  which are items recorded for financial statement purposes in a different period than for income tax returns 
the major item affecting the difference between the company s effective tax rate recorded on its financial statements and the federal statutory rate of is interest on tax exempt investments and loans 
other components affecting the company s effective tax rate include affordable housing tax credit investments  state income taxes and non deductible merger costs 
the company s effective tax rate was  and  respectively  in   and the lower effective tax rate in was attributable to a lower level of taxable income due primarily to the provision for losses on loans held for sale  a state tax law clarification in which allowed a portion of the company s revenues to be apportioned outside indiana and an increase in the level of tax exempt investments and affordable housing credits

risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in their loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s affiliate banks 
loan personnel at each bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
executive and board loan committees active at each bank serve as vehicles for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
these committees provide valuable input to lending personnel  act as an approval body  and monitor the overall quality of the banks loan portfolios 
the corporate loan committee  comprised of members of the company s executive officers and board of directors  strive to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program for its affiliate banks  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable credit losses identified during its loan review process 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b allocated reserves for certain loan categories and industries  large and out of market loans  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on trends in the type and volume of the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors 
specific reserves are provided for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

the company discontinued new sub prime out of market residential real estate lending during  and the portfolio of these loans was sold  as discussed previously 
refer also to the section entitled provision for loan losses in the discussion regarding the results of operations 
nonperforming assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due ninety days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents an analysis of the company s non performing assets 
the unfavorable trend in nonaccrual loans is primarily attributable to sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans 
the repositioning of the balance sheet regarding these types of loans during the fourth quarter of and subsequent sale of approximately million in principal balance of loans during the first quarter of is expected to mitigate the upward trend in non accrual loans 
this is a forward looking statement  see the cautions regarding forward looking statements included in item of this report for factors that could affect adversely the future levels of non performing assets  including non accrual loans  which cautionary statement is herein incorporated by reference 
approximately million of the total other real estate owned at year end was attributable to properties acquired in satisfaction of sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans 
approximately  of the increase in other real estate owned in was related to one commercial property 
non performing assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      past due loans      restructured loans total nonperforming loans      other real estate    total nonperforming assets      non performing loans to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans 
interest income recognized on nonperforming loans for was  the gross interest income that would have been recognized in on nonperforming loans if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms is  loans are placed on nonaccrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
accounting standards require recognition of loan impairment if a loan s full principal or interest payments are not expected to be received 
loans considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of collateral  by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to such loans 
the total dollar amount of impaired loans at december  was  for additional detail on impaired loans  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
the affiliate banks source of funding is predominately core deposits  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
funds management committees at the holding company and each affiliate bank monitor compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see the following section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the holding company and its affiliate banks 
primary market risks which impact the company s operations are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to decrease in the event of an increase in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to increase in the event of a decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands 
interest rate sensitivity as of december  net portfolio value net portfolio as a of present value value of assets changes in rates amount change npv ratio change base  the above discussion  and the portions of management s discussion and analysis that are referenced in the above discussion contains statements relating to future results of the company that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements relate to  among other things  simulation of the impact on net interest income from changes in interest rates 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied therein as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties expressed above  those that are described in management s discussion and analysis in item of this report  and those that are described in item of this report  business  under the caption forward looking statements  which discussions are incorporated herein by reference
