as of december   we had more than  customers  including over  under recurring contract 
during the year ended december   our quarterly revenue increased rapidly  climbing from million in the first quarter ended march  to million in the fourth quarter ended december  we derive revenue primarily from the sale of our content delivery and streaming services under contracts with typical terms of to months 
in addition  we provide certain streaming content delivery services on an individual live event basis 
we also derive revenue from our interactive portal  streaming related products and services  software licensing and professional services 
we recognize revenue from our content delivery and streaming services based on the amount of data delivered through our network  including minimum monthly usage commitments 
we record installation and set up fees as deferred revenue and recognize these fees ratably over the life of the customer contract 
we recognize revenue from licensed software when delivery has occurred  the fee for the software is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and a written software license agreement has been signed by us and our customer 
we recognize revenue from streaming related products and services such as encoding  production and equipment when the services are performed or the equipment is shipped and accepted by the customer and we have no further performance obligations 
we recognize revenue from our interactive portal based on monthly contracted fees paid by our portal technology partners for their participation in the portal 
finally  we recognize revenue from professional services when these services are performed 
we expect that revenue from our content delivery services will continue to represent the majority of our revenue through fiscal we also expect to leverage our proprietary content delivery technology into new revenue generating opportunities in fiscal  such as enterprise and private content delivery networks and technology licensing 
for the year ended december   over of our revenue was derived from customers located in the united states 
we expect revenue from international locations to increase in for the year ended december   apple computer represented of our total revenue and each other customer represented less than of revenue 
for the year ended december   apple computer and yahoo accounted for and of our total revenue  respectively 
we expect revenue from apple computer to decline as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal although our revenue has consistently increased from quarter to quarter  we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology  build out our world wide network  sell and market our products and support our operations 
we have also incurred significant amortization expense from the acquisition of businesses 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the 
table of contents future 
we believe that our success is dependent on increasing our customer base  developing new services and expanding our world wide network 
in order to execute our business plan  we intend to continue to invest in sales  marketing  engineering and development  and we will continue to incur increasing general and administrative costs 
we will also have significant non cash expenses in the future  including the amortization of deferred compensation and goodwill and other intangible assets

the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price of million  based on the fair value of the consideration paid plus direct acquisition costs  was allocated to net tangible assets of million and goodwill and other intangible assets of million

see acquired in process research and development

the purchase price of million  based on the fair value of the consideration paid plus direct acquisition costs  was allocated to net liabilities assumed of  and million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have included the results of operations of cts subsequent to july  in our statement of operations for the year ended december  as of december   we had unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets of billion on the balance sheet 
we assess the carrying value of these intangible assets quarterly for the existence of facts or circumstances both internally and externally that may suggest impairment 
to date  we believe that no such impairment has occurred 
we expect that amortization expense for these intangibles over the next three years will be million in  million in  and million in results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the period from inception august  through december  revenue 
revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
revenue increased primarily due to the significant growth of our content provider customer base  an increase in content delivery for many of these customers and new products and services sold to these customers 
revenue also increased in as we acquired new customers such as network providers and technology providers 
these customers primarily resell our services and purchase technology licenses  portal 
table of contents services and professional services 
resellers accounted for approximately of our revenue in collectively  revenue from technology licenses  portal services and professional services were approximately of our revenues in while we believe that revenues from network providers and technology providers will grow in  these are early stage markets for us and our future revenue from these markets is uncertain and subject to volatility 
we expect revenue to increase in the future as we add new customers and sell new services 
revenue increased from in the period from inception august  through december  to million in due to the commercial introduction of our services in april cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid to network providers for bandwidth  monthly fees for housing our servers in third party network data centers and depreciation of network equipment used in providing our services 
in addition  cost of revenue includes network storage costs  live event costs such as costs for production  encoding and signal acquisition  cost of equipment and costs of professional services 
we enter into contracts for bandwidth with third party network providers with terms typically ranging from one to three years 
these contracts commit us to pay minimum monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above the contracted level or may commit us to share with the third party network providers a portion of the revenue recognized from customers that use these third party networks 
under the akamai accelerated networks program  internet service providers make available to us rack space for our servers and access to their bandwidth at little or no cost 
we do not recognize as revenue any value to the internet service providers associated with the use of our servers and do not expense the value of the rack space and bandwidth that we receive at no cost 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
cost of revenue increased from  in the period from inception august  through december  to million in cost of revenue increased in both periods primarily due to greater depreciation expense on our servers and increased bandwidth costs as we expanded our network 
gross margins  defined as revenue less cost of revenue  were in compared to in gross margins increased in due to an increase in network utilization  a decline in the ratio of bandwidth costs to our content delivery prices and the introduction of high margin services and licensing revenue 
while gross margins are expected to increase in the future  fluctuations are possible as fixed costs increase due to the rapid expansion of our global network 
furthermore  uncertainty in revenue growth from new services and licensing to content providers  network providers and technology providers could cause volatility in our future gross margins 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs and costs related to the design  development  testing  deployment and enhancement of our services and our network 
to date  we have expensed our engineering and development costs as incurred 
we believe that product development is critical to our future objectives and we intend to continue to enhance our technology to meet the challenging requirements of market demand 
engineering and development expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
engineering and development expenses increased from  in the period from inception august  through december  to million in engineering and development expenses increased in both periods primarily due to personnel and payroll related expenses due to an increase in headcount 
we expect engineering and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue to increase headcount and invest in new technology 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of marketing  sales  operations and finance personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  advertising costs  legal and accounting services  and depreciation expense on internal use property and equipment 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased from  in the period from inception august  through december  to million in sales  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increased personnel and payroll related expenses  increased sales commissions  advertising campaigns initiated during the year  and increased 
table of contents depreciation associated with property and equipment 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in due to increased personnel and payroll related expenses and increased advertising expenses 
we expect that sales  general and administrative costs will increase in the future as we hire personnel  expand our operations  initiate marketing programs  establish sales offices in new locations and incur additional costs to grow our business and operations 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill  acquired in business combinations 
amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to  in and  in the period from inception august  through december  the increase in amortization of intangible assets in was due to the acquisitions of network  intervu and cts in we expect that amortization expense for these intangibles over the next three years will be million in  million in  and million in acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development  which we refer to as ipr d  consists of a nonrecurring charge of million in for the value of development projects acquired from intervu that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
ipr d was identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by management regarding four products under development 
development projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as completed technology and are being amortized over three years 
projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses were classified as ipr d and were charged to expense on the date of the acquisition 
the value of ipr d was determined based on each project s stage of development  the time and resources needed for completion  the contribution of core technology and the projected discounted cash flows of completed products 
the discount rate was determined considering our weighted average cost of capital and the risks surrounding the successful completion of the projects under development 
as of december   the four development projects are continuing on schedule and there has not been a significant change in the revenue and cost assumptions used to determine the total ipr d 
equity related compensation 
equity related compensation consists of the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the grant of stock options or shares of restricted stock to employees at exercise or sale prices deemed to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date  and the intrinsic value of modified stock options or restricted stock awards  measured at the modification date  for the number of awards that  absent the modification  would have expired unexercisable 
equity related compensation increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the modification of vesting of stock options for terminated employees 
as of december   the balance in deferred compensation  a component of stockholders equity  was million 
this amount will be amortized ratably over the remaining vesting periods of the associated restricted stock awards or stock options 
we expect to amortize deferred compensation to equity related compensation by approximately million in  million in and million in interest income  net 
interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances  which are invested in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate obligations and certificates of deposit 
interest income  net  increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
interest income  net  increased due to interest earned on proceeds from the sale of our convertible notes in june and from our initial public offering in november  partially offset by interest expense accrued on our convertible notes 
interest income  net  increased from  in the period from inception august  through december  to million in the increase was due primarily to interest earned on proceeds from various preferred stock offerings  offset by interest expense on subordinated notes issued to finance our operations prior to our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in november  we financed our operations primarily through private sales of our capital stock and issuances of senior subordinated notes totaling approximately 
table of contents million in net proceeds through december  in november  we sold shares of common stock through our initial public offering 
net proceeds to us from the initial public offering were million after deducting an aggregate of million in underwriting discounts and commissions to the underwriters 
in june  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes for aggregate net proceeds of million  net of offering expense of million 
the convertible notes are due july   and are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share equivalent to shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment in certain events 
interest on the convertible notes is payable semiannually on january and july of each year 
in january  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that will enable us to sell up to million of equity or debt securities in one or more public offerings over the next two years 
to date  we have not offered or sold any securities under this registration statement 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totalled million 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was  for the period from inception august  through december  cash used in operating activities increased in each period due to increased losses from operations and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we expect cash flows from operating activities to be negative through at least cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was million for the period from inception august  through december  cash used in investing activities in reflects purchases of marketable securities of million  sales and maturities of marketable securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million  consisting primarily of servers for the deployment and expansion of our network  information systems used to operate our business  and facility improvements 
also during  we made a cash payment of million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of network  we acquired million in cash from the acquisition of intervu  and we made a cash payment of  in connection with the acquisition of cts 
cash used in investing activities in reflects purchases of property and equipment 
we expect to continue to expand our infrastructure by making approximately million of additional capital expenditures for fiscal we expect to finance these capital expenditures through current available cash and marketable securities or future vendor financing 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities was million for the period from inception august  through december  cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the sale of our convertible notes and the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  the sale of convertible preferred stock  the issuance of demand notes and an equipment line of credit 
in december  we exercised our right to pay off outstanding senior subordinated notes  of which million was paid in december and the remainder was paid during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in the period from inception august  through december  was primarily from the sale of convertible preferred stock 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
as new opportunities and needs arise  we may sell additional equity and debt securities in the future 
if additional funds are raised through issuances of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
it is our intention to at all times maintain cash on hand and borrowing capacity to meet funding needs for to months in the future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the standard requires that we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
to date  we have not engaged in derivative and hedging activities  and accordingly do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures 
akamai will adopt sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
in fiscal year in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b  which is effective no later than the quarter ended december  sab clarifies the sec s views regarding the recognition of revenue 
we adopted sab in fiscal the adoption of sab did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin primarily clarifies a the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock option awards and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
the application of fin did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate obligations and certificates of deposit 
an increase in interest rates of and basis points would decrease the fair value of our investment portfolio as of december  by approximately  and million  respectively 
a decrease in interest rates by and basis points would increase the fair value of our investment portfolio as of december  by  and million  respectively 
we expect to hold our marketable debt securities until maturity and do not expect to realize significant losses on the sale of marketable debt securities prior to maturity 
we also hold investments in the common or preferred stock of several public and private companies 
the fair value and cost of these investments at december  was million and million  respectively 
due to the limited operating history of these companies  many of which are in the start up stage  we may not be able to recover our initial investment of million 
we have foreign operations in europe 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do not expect that changes in foreign exchange rates will have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations  which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations
