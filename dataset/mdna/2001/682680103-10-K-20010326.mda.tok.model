operating environment and outlook the energy industry has undergone tremendous changes throughout the past decade 
the company s strategy has been and continues to be one of growth through acquiring assets that complement and strengthen each other  maximizing the earnings potential of existing assets through asset rationalization and consolidation and introducing regulatory initiatives that benefit the company and its customers 
the company believes that the energy markets will continue to see deregulation  although it may be different than how certain markets have been deregulated to date 
furthermore  management believes that the natural gas and electricity markets will continue to converge and consolidate providing additional opportunities for growth 
the company also believes that demand for natural gas will increase due in part to the construction of a significant amount of gas fired electric generating plants necessary to maintain adequate supply in the marketplace 
as this occurs  we anticipate natural gas prices to remain strong  although lower than the historic high prices in with these changes  company management also expects to see increased exploration for natural gas 
the company will continue to focus on enhancing the earnings potential of its existing assets through acquiring assets that grow the company s operations into new market areas and complement its existing asset base 
in  the company will further develop its trading capabilities by marketing and trading energy from its megawatt  gas fired electric generating plant configured to supply electric power during peak periods 
operating highlights acquisitions and capital expenditures the company made two significant asset acquisitions that greatly enhanced its gathering and processing  transportation and storage and marketing and trading segments 
the combined acquisitions included natural gas processing plants with a combined capacity of bcf d  approximately  miles of gathering and transmission lines  natural gas storage facilities with a combined capacity of approximately bcf and contributed to a significant increase in trading 
the acquisition of these assets demonstrates execution of the company s strategy of growing through acquisition of assets that strengthen and complement each other 
the company spent approximately million in and approximately million in constructing the million spring creek power plant expected to be completed and operational in june however  if the company continues on its existing schedule  the plant may be operational earlier than planned 
the company s production segment increased its common ownership interest in magnum hunter resources  inc mhr from nine percent to over twenty one percent in early this investment contributed approximately million in earnings during the growth of mhr through recent successful exploration and strong natural gas prices is expected to continue contributing to the company s earnings 
unbundling the company was subject to several unbundling and regulatory initiatives during some of the more significant actions include removal from regulation of the company s gathering and storage assets that were previously regulated by the occ 
ong and ogt will be considered as two separate regulated utilities on a prospective basis 
the two utility operations will be able to function independently in pursuing their respective targets and objectives 
kgs was successful in obtaining approval of weather normalization on a test basis and obtaining permanent approval of the weatherproof bill program that had been a temporary program 
the company believes that the successful implementation of these initiatives and programs will lead to increased opportunities

gathering  compression and dehydration revenues increased in compared to as a result of the assets acquired from kmi and dynegy 
the company hedged a portion of their ngl sales during since ngl prices were higher than the hedged price  the company did not realize the full benefit of higher prices 
however  the company also hedged a portion of their natural gas costs  which led to a reduction in natural gas costs since the average market price was higher than the hedged price 
the net effect of these hedges was a reduction in margin of approximately million 
operating costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization increased as a result of the assets acquired from kmi and dynegy acquisitions and the related goodwill 
the increase in operating costs is primarily attributable to increased personnel and related benefit costs resulting from the additional employees gained through the kmi and dynegy acquisitions and additional lease expense resulting from the bushton lease 
other income consists of the gain on the sale of the company s interest in the indian basin processing plant 
revenues increased in fiscal due to the acquisition of the midstream assets from koch 
the average ngl price per gallon for fiscal was lower than fiscal the increase in prices  in late fiscal  corresponded in time with the increase in volumes from the koch acquisition 
operating costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization also increased due to the additional assets and the cost of operating those assets

the average gas price realized increased due to the market increase in natural gas prices 
the increase in total gas gathered  gas processed  ngl sales and gas sales is primarily due to increased processing and fractionation capacity acquired in the kmi and dynegy acquisitions in early also  the results include a full year of operations from the koch acquisition in april the increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the company consolidating its plants in texas to optimize recoveries and lower operating costs 
in addition  the company had a full year of capital expenditures relating to the assets acquired from koch in april as compared to a partial year of capital expenditures in the fiscal year capital was required to sustain operations 
the increase in total assets is primarily attributable to a million increase in property  plant and equipment acquired in the kmi and dynegy acquisitions and a million increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to both increased business and increased prices

the increase in retained fuel revenues in  contributed million to transportation revenues 
this increase is primarily due to increased transportation volumes and higher prices 
storage revenues increased during compared to due to increased capacity of approximately bcf resulting from the acquisition of certain storage facilities from kmi 
although  storage revenues increased due to the acquisition  overall storage volumes as a percent of working capacity were down significantly because summer winter pricing differentials were not as prominent as in prior years 
the cost of sales increased as a result of the increase in retained fuel revenues 
gross margin on gas sales relate to merchant gas sales by westex that was acquired in april other revenues include fees for the leasing of the palo duro pipeline to enogex and the lease of the sayre storage facility to ngpl 
the increase from is primarily related to the leasing fees related to the palo duro pipeline 
this pipeline was acquired from kmi in operating costs and depreciation  depletion  and amortization increased in compared to primarily as a result of the kmi acquisition

working gas in storage represents both company owned and third party gas available to be withdrawn from the storage facilities and allow the storage facilities to retain the operating integrity of the storage facility 
the decrease in working gas in storage at december  compared to august   is primarily due to timing 
typically  in the summer months gas is purchased and injected into storage to be withdrawn in the winter months 
accordingly  since december  is in the middle of the heating season  working gas in storage is lower than at august  the company s storage levels are currently at approximately percent  which is considerably lower than the historic five year average of percent 
the low storage level at december   is due to the increased demand for natural gas 
total assets increased due to a million increase in property  plant and equipment and a million increase in accounts receivable  which are primarily due to the kmi acquisition 
regulatory initiatives in a may occ order  the company s transportation assets in oklahoma included in the transportation and storage segment became a separate regulated utility from the distribution segment 
pursuant to a july  order by the occ  the company s gathering and storage assets and related services in oklahoma were removed from utility regulation effective november  gathering and storage assets  including current gas in storage  of million were removed from rate base 
the distribution segment issued bids for upstream and downstream services in the fall of with bids awarded in the spring of through the bidding process  the transportation and storage segment maintained percent of the distribution segment s transportation services

operational highlights in may  ong settled a rate case with the occ that addressed a number of regulatory and unbundling issues 
see the highlights of this rate case below under regulatory initiatives

the impact of these decreases on gross margin was partially offset by million of gross margin resulting from additional as available gas sales during the year 
pcl  ect and other revenues have remained flat and are expected to increase slightly or remain flat due to the increased competition in rates 
the decrease in operating costs in compared to has resulted from a continued successful cost containment program and decreased salary and related benefit costs resulting from fewer employees 
the decrease in depreciation  depletion  and amortization is the result of the extension of estimated useful lives for assets located in oklahoma 
the revised estimated lives were approved by the occ in a rate order granted in may  which reduced depreciation expense and revenues by approximately million annually for oklahoma assets and the transfer of certain transportation assets from the distribution segment to the transportation and storage segment 
fiscal was the first complete year of service to the  customers added in the western acquisition 
however  warmer than normal weather  particularly in kansas  which was percent warmer than normal and where there was no temperature normalization  reduced net revenues and more than offset the effect of having a full twelve months of gas sales volumes and revenues

the increase in kansas gross margin per mcf for commercial customers is largely due to the company reducing its minimum capacity requirements for customers to become eligible for ect services pursuant to a regulatory order 
this resulted in several commercial customers becoming ect customers and the remaining commercial customers are low volume  high margin customers 
the decrease in kansas industrial gross margin per mcf is primarily due to a tariff rate reduction

year ended years ended december  august  volumes mmcf gas sales residential    commercial    industrial    total volumes sold    pcl and ect    total volumes delivered    the decrease in pcl and ect volumes is primarily due to some customers that use significant quantities of gas in their manufacturing process suspending manufacturing operations in late due to historically high natural gas prices 
in addition  volumes decreased due to warmer than normal temperatures in early these decreases were partially offset by the company reducing its minimum capacity requirements for customers to become eligible for pcl and ect services pursuant to a regulatory order 
the reduction of the minimum requirements allowed more low volume  high margin customers to be added to the customer base that  in turn  increased the total gross margin per mcf 
regulatory initiatives a rate case was settled between ong and the occ on may  in oklahoma resolving a number of regulatory and unbundling issues 
the more significant issues resolved include the following 
gas storage and gas gathering were deregulated and the related investments were removed from the regulated oklahoma distribution segment s rate base 
a million annual base rate reduction  effective with the first billing cycle in june  spread among all customer classes 
the pcl rider was terminated and the million balance was moved to base rates and included in the revenue reduction  thereby creating a net annual reduction of approximately million 
the company was allowed to recover approximately million annually from its distribution customers through a gathering rider 
the kgs oklahoma regulated services were consolidated with ong  which allows the kgs oklahoma customers to be served under the ong rate structure and allows the company to discontinue separate regulatory reporting and rate case activity for kgs oklahoma 
however  the company did sustain an annual margin reduction estimated at million related to this change since the previous kgs oklahoma rates were generally higher than the comparable ong rates that will now apply to these customers 
as a provision of this order  ong and ogt  included in the transportation and storage segment  will be considered two separate regulated utilities on a prospective basis 
the two utility operations are able to function independently in pursuing their respective targets and objectives 
during  the kcc issued an order allowing kgs to recover additional costs of its gas purchase hedging program established to protect the price paid by customers for gas purchases 
this year s unprecedented market volatility and natural gas prices prompted this action by the kcc 
the kcc also approved kgs s weatherproof bill program that had been a temporary program while being tested 
this plan allows customers  at their discretion  to fix their monthly payment 
the kcc also granted kgs weather normalization that prevents weather related revenue fluctuations 
ong began taking bids for transportation services in the fall of with bids awarded in spring for service beginning on november  as a result of this competitive bid process  ogt retained approximately percent of ong s upstream transportation requirements 
as contracts with pcl customers expire  these contracts may be renewed with the distribution segment  the transportation and storage segment or nonaffiliated service providers 
consequently  this could result in reduced revenues in the distribution segment

pcl and ect revenues and volumes decreased primarily due to the loss of three customers and the effect of warm weather including the temporary shut down of two power plants served by the distribution segment 
the volume decrease was partially offset by an increase in rates 
operating costs decreased due to reductions in labor expense  employee benefits  and other operating efficiencies 
the distribution segment continues its strategy of increased operational efficiency while maintaining quality customer service

 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
as the company continues to unbundle its services  certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for following sfas  and accordingly  a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required 
the company does not anticipate these costs to be significant 
production operational highlights the company s strategy is to concentrate ownership of hydrocarbon reserves in the mid continent region in order to add value not only to its existing production operations but also to the related gathering and processing  marketing  transportation  and storage businesses 
accordingly  the company focuses on exploitation activities rather than exploratory drilling 
as a result of a growth strategy through acquisitions and developmental drilling  the number of wells the company operates has increased 
in its role as operator  the company controls operating decisions that impact production volumes and lifting costs 
based on an industry survey  the company s production segment is one of the lowest cost small independent producers in the country 
the company continues to focus on reducing finding costs 
consistent with the company s strategy of acquiring assets that strengthen and complement each other  the production segment focuses its efforts on acquisitions and exploitation activities 
during  the company acquired approximately million in gas and oil properties 
the company also increased activities relating to its developmental drilling program 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company consummated the strategic alliance with magnum hunter resources mhr adding million in producing properties and becoming an equity owner in mhr at a cost of million 
the company also closed on two other properties with a purchase price of million adding reserves located in oklahoma 
the company purchased natural gas and oil reserves from oxy usa  inc oxy in fiscal the reserves are located in oklahoma and kansas and include more than wells 
net production was approximately million cubic feet of gas per day and barrels of oil per day upon acquisition and includes a gas sweetening plant 
the purchase price was approximately million 
based on estimated reserves  this transaction almost doubled the company s oil and gas reserves  at that time 
a percent equity interest in k 
stewart petroleum corp 
k stewart  was acquired on june  the acquisition creates opportunities to expand ownership of oil and gas reserves in the anadarko basin and for the company to achieve its strategic objective of growing its reserves base in areas where it has other energy related operations 
risk management since the volatility of energy prices has a significant impact on the profitability of this segment  the company utilizes commodity derivative instruments to offset this risk

the company hedged the majority of their production  which limited the company s ability to capitalize on the high natural gas prices that prevailed in the impact of slightly higher commodity prices realized by the company on revenues was partially offset by natural declines in production 
the production declines result from the fact that the majority of the company s reserves are located in the mid continent region  which are characteristically mature fields

new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement  was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in june  statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under statement  entities are required to record all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedge exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company  substantially through its nonutility segments  is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations and to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  ngls and crude oil 
market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices 
the company s primary exposure arises from fixed price purchase or sale agreements which extend for periods of up to months  gas in storage inventories utilized by the gas marketing and trading operation  and anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production 
to a lesser extent  the company is exposed to risk of changing prices or the cost of intervening transportation resulting from purchasing gas at one location and selling it at another hereinafter referred to as basis risk 
to minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  ngls and crude oil  the company uses commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts  swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements  existing physical gas in storage  and basis risk 
the company adheres to policies and procedures that limit its exposure to market risk from open positions and monitors its exposure to market risk 
to minimize the impact of weather on the distribution segment s operations  the company has used weather derivative swaps to manage the risk of fluctuations in heating degree days hdd during the heating season 
under the weather derivative swap agreements  the company receives a fixed payment per degree day below the contracted normal hdd and pays a fixed amount per degree day above the contracted normal hdd 
the swaps contain a contract cap that limits the amount either party is required to pay 
at december   the company is not a party to any weather derivative swaps 
in the past  kansas gas service used derivative instruments to hedge the cost of some anticipated gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas 
at december   kgs did not have any derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of gas purchases 
interest rate risk the company is subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business 
the company manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and interest rate swaps 
in the fourth quarter  the company unwound its interest rate swap 
accordingly  the company had no interest rate swaps at december  at december  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would result in an annual million change in interest costs related to short term and floating rate debt based on principal balances outstanding at these dates 
value at risk disclosure of market risk oneok measures entity wide market risk in its trading  price risk management  and its non trading portfolios using value at risk 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance  to determine risk targets and set position limits 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation 
oneok relies on value at risk to determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period 
oneok s value at risk exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for its trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and gas in storage assuming hypothetical movements in commodity market assumptions with no change in positions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
value at risk does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur because actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices  operating exposures and timing thereof  and the changes in the company s trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts 
at december   the company s estimated potential one day favorable or unfavorable impact on future earnings  as measured by the value at risk  using a percent confidence level and diversified correlation assuming one day to liquidate positions was million for its trading portfolio and million for its non trading portfolio
