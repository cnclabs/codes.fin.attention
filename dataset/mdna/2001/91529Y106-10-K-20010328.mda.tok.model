item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction on june   unum corporation unum merged with and into provident companies  inc provident under the name unumprovident corporation 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the historical financial results discussed herein give effect to the merger as if it had been completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein in item this discussion of consolidated operating results and operating results by segment excludes net realized investment gains and losses from revenue and income loss before taxes 
the company s investment focus has been on investment income to support its insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains 
due to the nature of the company s business  a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
the realization of investment gains and losses will impact future earnings levels as the underlying business is long term in nature and requires that the company be able to sustain the assumed interest rates in its liabilities 
however  income excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income as a measure of the company s profitability 
the trends in new annualized sales in the employee benefits  individual  and voluntary benefits segments are indicators of the company s potential for growth in its respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new products 
the company has closely linked its various incentive compensation programs to the achievement of its goals for new sales 
results of operations significant transactions and events during  the company completed a series of strategic transactions designed to more closely focus its operations on its core businesses  increase its financial flexibility  support its present credit and claims paying ratings  increase the risk based capital ratios of the insurance subsidiaries involved  and lower its leverage ratios 
the primary transaction involved agreements under which reassure america life insurance company reassure america  an affiliate of swiss re life health america inc swiss re  reinsured on a percent indemnity coinsurance basis substantially all of the individual life insurance and corporate owned life insurance policies written by the company s insurance subsidiaries  as well as a small block of individually underwritten group life insurance 
the reinsurance agreements were effective as of july  separately  the company and max re ltd 
entered into an agreement whereby max re ltd 
reinsured on a percent indemnity coinsurance basis the future claim payments on one of the company s insurance subsidiaries long duration group long term disability claims which were incurred prior to january  the agreement was effective january  during  the company entered into a reinsurance agreement with manulife reinsurance limited and scor reinsurance company under which one of the company s insurance subsidiaries will cede through a net quota share reinsurance agreement percent of the group life volume above the aggregate retention limit 
the treaties are five year quota share treaties ceding percent of premium  life volume  and paid claims to each reinsurer 
the reinsurance agreements were effective as of october  also in  the company purchased a single premium annuity for its retirees 
the pension plan transaction allowed the company to provide a higher level of administrative service for its retirees while also locking in favorable pension plan performance 
the proceeds from the transaction were partially offset by actions to further strengthen the company s financial position  namely reserve adjustments of million in the company s long term disability business and million in the reinsurance operations  asset write offs and loss provisions of million in the reinsurance operations  and consolidation and benefit accruals of million 
see the discussions of segment operating results contained herein for further information 
during  tax legislation was enacted in the united kingdom that allowed additional group tax relief among companies with common ownership 
the company expects to realize foreign tax benefits as a result of this legislation 
significant transactions and events as a result of the aforementioned merger at june   certain accounting policy changes were made during the following summarizes these changes as well as the expenses related to the merger and the early retirement offer to employees 
generally  because of the effort and time involved  reviews and updates of assumptions related to benefit liabilities are periodically undertaken over time and are reflected in the calculation of benefit liabilities as completed 
many factors influence assumptions underlying reserves  and considerable judgment is required to interpret current and historical experience underlying all of the assumptions and to assess the future factors that are likely to influence the ultimate cost of settling existing claims 
prior to the june  merger  unum s process and assumptions used to calculate the discount rate for claim reserves of certain disability businesses differed from that used by provident 
while unum s and provident s methods for calculating the discount rate for disability claim reserves were both in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believed that the combined entity should have consistent discount rate accounting policies and methods for applying these policies for similar products 
the previous unum methodology used the same investment strategy for assets backing both liabilities and surplus 
provident s methodology  which allows for different investment strategies for assets backing surplus than those backing product liabilities  was determined by management to be the more appropriate approach for the combined entity 
accordingly  at june   the company adopted provident s method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves 
the impact on earnings related to the change in method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves was million before tax and million after tax 
the charge was reflected in the employee benefits  individual  and other segments as an increase in benefits to policyholders of million  million  and million  respectively 
subsequent to the merger date  the company began to integrate the valuation procedures of the two organizations to provide for a more effective linking of pricing and reserving assumptions and to facilitate a more efficient process for adjusting liabilities to emerging trends 
included in this integration activity were a review and an update of assumptions that underlie policy and contract benefit liabilities 
the purpose of the study was to confirm or update the assumptions which were viewed as likely to affect the ultimate liability for contract benefits 
accordingly  as a result of the merger  the company accelerated the performance of its normal reviews of the assumptions underlying reserves to determine the assumptions that the newly merged company will use in the future for pricing  performance management  and reserving 
the review resulted in an increase in the benefits and reserves for future benefits for the company s domestic group long term disability unpaid claim liabilities 
as a result of the review  the company increased its policy and contract benefit liabilities million in the third quarter of  which reduced results million before tax and million after tax 
during  the company recorded before tax expenses related to the merger of approximately million million after tax for severance and related costs  exit costs for duplicate facilities and asset abandonments  and investment banking  legal  and accounting fees 
the company also recorded in a before tax expense of approximately million million after tax related to the early retirement offer to the company s employees 
these expenses are reported in the corporate segment as other operating expenses and are further discussed in the section corporate segment operating results 
additionally  in the company expensed million million after tax of incremental costs associated with the merger 
these incremental costs consist primarily of compensation  training  integration  and licensing costs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges and liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of capital and financing needs 
during the company also recognized million of before tax charges related to its reinsurance operations 
these charges were as follows in millions north american reinsurance operations loss on sale of a h and ltc reinsurance management operations includes write off of million of goodwill loss on reinsurance of a h and ltc risk participations provision for losses on retained business international reinsurance operations provision for losses on lloyd s of london syndicate participations provision for losses on reinsurance pool participations other than lloyd s goodwill impairment excluding amount recognized on sale total before tax charge see other segment operating results and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges and the company s reinsurance operations 
a portion of the losses recognized in relating to the company s reinsurance operations does not receive a tax benefit  which unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate 
additionally  a portion of the expenses related to the merger was non deductible for federal income tax purposes  resulting in a tax rate that was less than the us federal statutory tax rate of percent 
in  the company recorded refunds from the internal revenue service relating to the final settlement of remaining issues for the through tax years 
the refund of taxes was million  and interest on the refunds was million 
overall  including interest and the tax provision thereon  results increased million due to settlements of prior year tax issues

employee benefits new annualized sales  on a submitted date basis  decreased percent to million in from million in and million in on an effective date basis  sales decreased percent to million in from  million in and million in although total year over year comparisons show a decrease  submitted sales during the last half of increased million over sales submitted during the last half of sales that combine long term disability  short term disability  and group life products also increased from prior year  showing continued strong integrated sales and collaboration in the field 
during  percent of all new sales were with long term disability  short term disability  and group life combined coverage  compared to percent in sales related to employee benefits can fluctuate significantly due to large case size and timing of sales submissions 
several factors contributed to the decrease in sales compared to and  including rate increases and turnover in the field sales force during the first half of the company has a number of initiatives underway to help maintain the sales momentum achieved during the last half of  including targeted incentive plans  organizational changes to create a greater focus on the customer  and enhanced communication with producers 
in order to give the appropriate focus to the company s primary business markets  the company has established national practice groups to focus on large employers  executive benefits  and voluntary benefits 
these national practice groups partner with the company s sales force and representatives from claims  customer service  and underwriting to present coverage solutions to potential customers and to manage existing customer accounts 
the company expects that these actions will continue to favorably impact sales growth  but management intends to maintain pricing discipline to balance sales growth and profitability  which may slow the rate of long term sales growth 
the company monitors persistency and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current period s amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
actual persistency experienced during for group disability  group life  and accidental death and dismemberment products compared unfavorably to the persistency expected  resulting in additional amortization of million during the adverse persistency during relates primarily to large case terminations and an aggressive renewal program that was heavily concentrated in the first half of the year 
it is expected that persistency for the foreseeable future will continue to be lower than historical levels for group disability as well as group life 
the company s renewal program was generally successful at retaining business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated 
it is expected that the additional premium and related profits associated with this renewal activity will emerge throughout the company intends to maintain a disciplined approach in the re pricing of renewal business  while balancing the need to maximize persistency and retain producer relationships 
this approach may lead to lower profit margins on affected cases than originally planned 
revenue from the managed disability line of business  which includes genex services  inc and options and choices  inc  totaled million in compared to million in and million in group disability group disability revenue was  million in compared to  million in new annualized sales for group long term disability on a submitted date basis were million in and million in new annualized sales for group short term disability were million in compared to million in on an effective date basis  new annualized sales for long term disability and short term disability were million and million in and million and million in a critical part of the company s strategy for group disability during involved executing its renewal program and managing persistency  both of which management expects will have a positive impact on future premium growth and profitability 
however  the high terminations and slow sales have decreased the earned premium growth compared to that experienced during and the company is implementing pricing changes in the group disability line 
prices will increase or decrease by market segment  as appropriate  to respond to current claim experience and other factors and assumptions 
net investment income is expected to continue to increase due to the increase in the level of invested assets allocated to this line of business and the increased duration on new investments 
group disability reported income of million for compared to a loss of million for included in the income for was an increase of million in group long term disability claim reserves  which represents approximately percent of total group long term disability claim reserves 
the increase  which resulted from lengthening the projected average claim duration for certain of the company s group long term disability claims  was not a result of deteriorating experience but was believed appropriate based on the company s assessment of the ultimate settlement of these claims 
the loss of million was the result of the million charge resulting from lowering the discount rate used to calculate certain of unum s disability claim reserves to conform with provident s process and assumptions and the million charge resulting from the revision in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the ultimate cost of unpaid group long term disability claims  as discussed in the preceding results of operations 
excluding the adjustments to the disability claim liabilities discussed in the preceding paragraph  the benefit ratio for group disability was percent in compared to percent in for long term disability  the ratio for compared unfavorably to  but showed slight improvement throughout the paid claim incidence for long term disability compares favorably to due to lower claim acceptance rates  and claim resolution experience continued to improve during the submitted claim incidence rate for long term disability was higher than the rate for the benefit ratio for short term disability decreased marginally from the ratio 
the incidence of submitted claims for short term disability remained relatively constant throughout and  declining slightly in compared to the rate 
negative impacts on the benefit ratio in were the average claim duration  which increased to its highest level in recent periods during  and an increase in the average weekly indemnity 
additionally  the increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs had a negative impact on income 
this increase resulted from million of additional amortization necessitated by the higher level of group long term and short term disability terminations experienced during relative to that which was expected at the time the business was written 
however  the disability business retained is relatively more profitable than the business that terminated 
the additional amortization during was million 
income in was positively impacted by a percent revenue increase and an improvement in both the commission and operating expense ratios 
as previously discussed under results of operations  during the company entered into a percent indemnity coinsurance agreement to cede the future claim payments on one of its insurance subsidiaries long duration group long term disability claims which were incurred prior to january  the agreement was effective january  group disability revenue increased to  million in compared to  million in premium income growth was driven primarily by prior period sales 
as previously discussed  the rate of growth in new sales declined during new annualized sales  on a submitted date basis  for group long term disability were million in compared to million in new annualized sales for group short term disability were million in as compared to million in on an effective date basis  new annualized sales for long term disability and short term disability were million and million in and million and million in net investment income increased during due to the increase in the level of invested assets allocated to this line of business and also due to the portfolio restructuring which occurred subsequent to the merger 
group disability reported a loss of million for  as compared with million of income for the loss was the result of the million second quarter charge and the million third quarter charge as previously discussed 
excluding the effect of these two charges  this line reported an percent benefit ratio for the benefit ratio for was percent  excluding the effect of the fourth quarter of claims disruption charge discussed in the following paragraphs 
the incidence rates for new claims submitted for long term disability increased during over the level experienced in  but new claim incidence rates in the third and fourth quarters of improved relative to levels experienced in the first half of and the last half of small case business continues to perform well  and large case and mid size business showed improvement in the incidence rates for new claims submitted for short term disability improved during as compared to as explained in more detail below  the actual increase in claims durations during was greater than the increase assumed in the fourth quarter of claims disruption charge  resulting in a negative impact on the benefit ratio 
additionally  the benefit ratio was positively impacted by the updated factors used in calculating social security offset amounts 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for includes million of additional amortization due to the higher than expected level of terminations for long term and short term disability experienced during the fourth quarter of also included in is million of amortization related to the write off of the unamortized balance of deferred costs related to certain discontinued products in the foreign operations 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge for the group long term disability line of business in the employee benefits segment for the expected increase in claims durations due to management s expectation that productivity in the claims organization would be impacted as a result of planning  consolidation  and integration efforts related to the merger 
management expected the claims integration efforts to have some benefits  primarily related to claims incurred in future periods  as well as the potential for improved customer satisfaction and lower ultimate claim costs as best practices in return to work and claims management were implemented 
as benefits related to the integration become known  reserve assumptions will be revised  if appropriate 
insurance policies that are impacted by the temporary change in claim resolution rates will not perform as anticipated when priced 
since the cause of the additional claim cost is of a temporary nature  it is not anticipated to have an effect on future policy pricing 
during  the claim operations integration activities progressed as assumed 
at december   management assumed the revised group disability claim resolution rates for the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of to be    and percent of assumptions  respectively  before adjusting for the impact of the claim operations integration activities 
the actual experience was percent for the first quarter of  percent for the second quarter  percent for the third quarter  and percent for the fourth quarter 
if the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim durations had not been anticipated at december   the loss for the group long term disability line of business would have been negatively impacted by million 
however  the shortfall of the actual experience below that assumed resulted in a negative effect on results of million 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  claim resolution assumptions underlying existing claim reserves were revised in the third quarter of  resulting in an increase in benefit liabilities of million 
in selecting the revised claim resolution assumptions  consideration was given to claims operations integration activities referenced here as well as other factors expected to impact the future effectiveness of the claims operations 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as discussed under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the company s business 
components of claims experience  including but not limited to  incidence levels and claims duration  may be worse than expected 
management monitors claims experience in group disability and responds to changes by periodically adjusting prices  refining underwriting guidelines  changing product features  and strengthening risk management policies and procedures 
the company expects to price new business and re price existing business  at contract renewal dates  in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these and other factors  including interest rates  on new claim liabilities 
given the competitive market conditions for the company s disability products  it is uncertain whether pricing actions can entirely mitigate the effect 
the company  similar to all financial institutions  has some exposure if a severe and prolonged recession occurs  but management believes that the company is well positioned if a weaker economy were to occur 
many of the company s products can be repriced  which would allow the company to reflect in its pricing any fundamental change which might occur in the risk associated with a particular industry or company within an industry 
the company has a well diversified book of insurance exposure  with no unusual concentrations of risk in any one industry 
because of improvements made in the claims organization in recent years  the company believes it can respond to increased levels of submitted claims which might result from a slowing economy 
group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care reported income of million in compared to million in new annualized sales on a submitted date basis decreased to million in as compared to million in on an effective date basis  new annualized sales were million in compared to million for group life and long term care both reported an increase in revenue for compared to due to increases in premium income and net investment income 
offsetting the revenue increase was an increase in the benefit ratio when compared to group life reported an unfavorable benefit ratio in compared to the prior year due to an increase in the average paid claim size and waiver incidence  partially offset by favorable paid mortality incidence 
the benefit ratio for accidental death and dismemberment compares unfavorably with the increase in the average paid claim size contributed to the unfavorable comparison 
submitted incidence for accidental death and dismemberment has improved relative to the reinsurance transaction with reassure america  discussed under item contained herein  reduced group life and accidental death and dismemberment premium income and benefits approximately million and million  respectively 
the reinsurance transaction with manulife reinsurance limited and scor reinsurance company  under which an insurance subsidiary of the company cedes through a net quota share reinsurance agreement percent of the group life volume above the aggregate retention limit  does not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and is therefore accounted for as a deposit 
as such  there is no effect on reported premium income or benefits 
the only impact on the income statement is the risk charge paid to the reinsurers 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the reinsurance transactions 
group long term care reported a higher benefit ratio for compared to the long term care net claim resolution rate for is below the average rate for  primarily due to a decrease in claim recoveries 
the incidence rates for both submitted and paid claims improved over the prior year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for includes million of additional amortization due to the higher level of terminations for group life and accidental death and dismemberment products experienced during relative to that which was expected at the time the policies were written 
positively impacting income was an improvement in the commission and operating expense ratios 
group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care reported income of million in compared to million in the increase resulted from the growth in premium income  which was driven by strong prior period sales  and a lower operating expense ratio 
the results also benefited from higher net investment income and a higher volume of business 
there was a slight increase in the benefit ratio  from percent in to percent in  primarily due to an increase in the average claim size in the group life line of business 
new annualized sales on a submitted date basis increased to million in compared to million in on an effective date basis  sales were million in and million in premium persistency for group life in was lower than historical levels  and subsequently the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for includes million of additional amortization due to the higher than expected level of terminations

individual life  which was previously included in the individual segment  is no longer actively marketed and is now reported in the other segment 
historical by segment results have been reclassified 
see other segment operating results for further discussion of the individual life line of business 
individual disability new annualized sales in the individual disability line of business were million in compared to million in and million in as discussed in the employee benefits segment operating results  several factors have contributed to the decrease in sales 
however  persistency of existing individual disability income business remained high during and the company has developed a new individual disability product portfolio which was released for sale in approved states early in the fourth quarter of this product line consolidates the current offerings of the company s insurance subsidiaries into one new simplified product portfolio 
the new portfolio utilizes a modular approach offering customers a range of product options and features 
this portfolio was designed to combine the best features from prior company offerings and includes return to work incentives and optional long term care conversion benefits and or benefits for catastrophic disabilities 
management expects that premium income in the individual disability line will grow on a year over year basis  contingent on further state approvals of the new product portfolio  as the portfolio transition produces increasing levels of new sales of individual disability products and as a result of an increased focus on integrated disability sales in group and individual  as well as other sales initiatives discussed under employee benefits segment operating results 
revenue was  million in compared to  million in the growth in revenue was driven primarily by the growth in premium income as well as net investment income and other income 
premium income in included million from an inforce block of individual disability business reinsured effective january  other income benefited from the income on assets held in trust under this reinsurance arrangement 
net investment income for individual disability increased due to the increase in the level of invested assets allocated to this line of business 
income in the individual disability line of business was million in  an increase of million from the prior year 
as discussed in the preceding results of operations  in the second quarter of the company lowered the discount rate used to calculate certain of unum s disability claim reserves to conform with provident s process and assumptions  which decreased individual disability income by million in excluding this adjustment  individual disability income decreased million in compared to this line reported an increase in the benefit ratio for compared to last year s ratio  excluding the discount rate change 
submitted incidence for is slightly higher than the average for the year  while paid incidence has improved relative to the prior year 
the claim acceptance rate has been declining throughout and  and the net claim resolution rate for compares favorably with offsetting these favorable trends was an increase in reserves for existing claims and claims in dispute 
individual disability benefited from improved commission and operating expense ratios for as compared to the amortization of value of business acquired increased in primarily as a result of the amortization on the block of inforce business reinsured effective january  income in the individual disability income line of business increased to million in from million in excluding the discount rate change of million  this line reported an increase in the benefit ratio in compared to the claim resolution rate compared unfavorably with  but showed improvement throughout new claims for were fairly level with this line benefited from higher net investment income and a favorable operating expense ratio for as compared to as noted in the employee benefits segment operating results  claim resolution rates were revised downward in the fourth quarter of for claim operations integration activities related to the merger 
the company recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of in the individual segment related to the revised claim resolution rates for individual disability 
at december   management assumed the revised individual disability claim resolution rates for the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of to be    and percent of assumptions  before adjusting for the impact of the claim operations integration activities 
the actual experience for the company was percent in the first quarter  percent in the second quarter  percent in the third quarter  and percent in the fourth quarter of if the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim durations had not been anticipated at december   income for the individual disability line of business would have been negatively impacted by million in in addition  the excess of the actual experience over that assumed resulted in a positive effect on income of million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
individual long term care the individual long term care line of business reported increased premium income for both and as compared to the previous years  primarily due to continued new sales growth 
new annualized sales were million in  million in  and million in the company expects the strong sales momentum in individual long term care to continue 
net investment income continues to increase due to the growth in this line of business 
income for was million  compared to losses of million in and million in the increase in revenue  as well as improvements in both the benefit ratio and operating expense ratios  contributed to the year over year increases 
voluntary benefits segment operating results in millions of dollars year ended december change change revenue premium income net investment income other income total revenue benefits and expenses benefits and change in reserves for future benefits commissions deferral of policy acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs amortization of value of business acquired operating expenses total benefits and expenses income before federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses the voluntary benefits segment includes the results of products sold to employees through payroll deduction at the workplace 
these products include life insurance and health products  primarily disability  accident and sickness  and cancer 
revenue in the voluntary benefits segment increased to million in from million in and million in sales growth and continued favorable persistency were the primary factors contributing to the increase in premium income 
new annualized sales in this segment were million in  million in  and million in management continues its efforts to increase sales through the sales initiatives discussed under employee benefits segment operating results 
the investment income growth in as compared to was due to the repositioning of the investment portfolio subsequent to the merger 
income for increased percent over  primarily due to revenue growth of million 
an additional positive impact on income was a favorable operating expense ratio attributable to costs savings resulting from the merger 
the benefit ratio was unfavorable compared to the primary drivers were unfavorable results in the life product line and an increase in the incurred and paid loss ratios for the cancer product line 
income in the voluntary benefits segment in was million versus million in the increase in income for was primarily due to the increase in premium income in all of the product lines and an increase in investment income  partially offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the life  accident and sickness  and disability product lines

it is expected that revenue and income in this segment will decline over time as these business lines wind down 
management expects to reinvest the capital supporting these lines of business in the future growth of the employee benefits  individual  and voluntary benefits segments 
the closed blocks of business have been segregated for reporting and monitoring purposes 
individual life and corporate owned life as previously discussed  during the company reinsured substantially all of the individual life and corporate owned life insurance blocks of business 
the company ceded approximately billion of reserves to the reinsurer 
the million before tax and million after tax gain on these transactions was deferred and is being amortized into income based upon expected future premium income on the traditional insurance policies ceded and estimated future gross profits on the interest sensitive insurance policies ceded 
the company recognized a before tax realized investment loss of million on the fixed maturity securities transferred to the reinsurer 
in connection with this realized loss  the company retrospectively adjusted deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired related to interest sensitive individual life policies with credits to current period amortization of million and million  respectively  to reflect investment experience

the cost associated with these office closures was approximately million  which represents the cost of future minimum lease payments less any estimated amounts recovered under subleases 
also  certain physical assets  primarily computer equipment  redundant systems  and systems incapable of supporting the combined entity  were abandoned as a result of the merger  resulting in a write down of the assets book values by approximately million

investments investment activities are an integral part of the company s business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results 
invested assets are segmented into portfolios  which support the various product lines 
generally  the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset durations with related expected liability durations and to maximize investment returns  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s investments 
subsequent to the june  merger and continuing through the first half of  the company actively pursued its strategy of extending the duration of its investments and shifting the mix of assets for approximately billion of its investments in order to reduce vulnerability to interest rate risk in the future and increase investment income 
excluding net investment income attributable to the individual life and corporate owned life insurance blocks of business ceded effective as of july   net investment income for increased percent over due to increased yields and growth in the asset base 
during  the company reported net realized investment losses before tax of million  including the realized investment loss of million on the investment grade fixed maturity securities transferred to the reinsurer in connection with the individual life and corporate owned life reinsurance transactions 
the loss on these transferred securities was driven by a change in market interest rates and was not attributable to any credit deterioration 
excluding the reinsurance transaction related loss  the company reported net gains of million from the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities 
offsetting these gains was a million realized investment loss recognized as a result of management s determination that the value of certain fixed maturity investments had other than temporarily declined 
the following table provides the distribution of invested assets for the years indicated 
policy loans are reported on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition and in the table below 
as of december   billion of policy loans were ceded  and the investment income thereon is no longer included in income 
december investment grade fixed maturity securities below investment grade fixed maturity securities equity securities mortgage loans real estate policy loans other invested assets total fixed maturity securities the company s investment in mortgage backed securities was approximately billion and billion on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
at december   the mortgage backed securities had an average life of years and effective duration of years 
the mortgage backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal 
the company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities at december   was  million  representing percent of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans  below the company s internal limit of percent of invested assets for this type of investment 
the company s exposure to below investment grade fixed maturities totaled  million at december   representing percent of invested assets 
below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
management does not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by the investments in below investment grade securities  nor does it expect these investments to adversely affect its ability to hold its other investments to maturity 
mortgage loans and real estate the company s mortgage loan portfolio was  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company uses a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each mortgage loan and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
the company establishes an investment valuation allowance for mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
the mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types 
the incidence of new problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity has remained low in and  reflecting improvements in overall economic activity and improving real estate markets in the geographic areas where the company has mortgage loans 
management expects the level of delinquencies and problem loans to remain low in the future 
no new mortgage loans were added to the company s investment portfolio during other than one purchase money mortgage for million associated with the sale of real estate 
at december  and  impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
included in the impaired loans at december  were million of loans which had a related  specific investment valuation allowance of million and million of loans which had no related  specific allowance 
impaired mortgage loans are not expected to have a material impact on the company s liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
restructured mortgage loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and represent loans that have been refinanced with terms more favorable to the borrower 
interest lost on restructured loans was immaterial for and real estate was million and million at december  and investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets the company s investment criteria 
if investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value 
occasionally  investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets the company s investment criteria 
real estate held for sale  which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell  amounted to million at december   and million at december  investment valuation allowances for mortgage loans and real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets as well as on an overall portfolio basis  considering the value of the underlying assets and collateral 
if a decline in value is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired  the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value  and the reduction is recorded as a realized investment loss 
management monitors the risk associated with the invested asset portfolio and regularly reviews and adjusts the investment valuation allowance 
as a result of management s most recent review of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and based on management s expectation that delinquencies and problem loans will remain low  the valuation allowance on mortgage loans was reduced million during at december   the balance in the valuation allowance for mortgage loans and real estate was million and million  respectively 
other the company s exposure to non current investments totaled million at december   or percent of invested assets 
these non current investments are foreclosed real estate held for sale and fixed income securities and mortgage loans that became more than thirty days past due in principal and interest payments 
the company utilizes interest rate futures contracts  current and forward interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  and options on forward interest rate swaps  forward treasuries  or specific fixed income securities to manage duration and increase yield on cash flows expected from current holdings and products 
all transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative 
almost all transactions are associated with the individual and group disability product portfolios 
all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations  principally in its insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  and operating expenses as well as purchases of new investments 
the company has established an investment strategy that management believes will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations were  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million and  million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
the company believes the cash flows from its operations will be sufficient to meet its operating and financial cash flow requirements  excluding the strain placed on capital as a result of the charges recorded in connection with the merger 
as a result of the effect on capital during of the merger related charges  the company raised approximately million through the debt markets during the fourth quarter of by securing million of one year bank debt and by issuing commercial paper 
the company is dependent upon payments from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its stockholders and to pay its expenses 
these payments by the company s insurance and non insurance subsidiaries may take the form of interest payments on amounts loaned to such subsidiaries by the company  operating and investment management fees  and or dividends 
at december   the company had outstanding from its insurance subsidiaries a million surplus debenture due in with a weighted average interest rate during of percent and a million surplus debenture due in with a weighted average interest rate during of percent 
semi annual interest payments are conditional upon the approval by the insurance department of the state of domicile 
restrictions under applicable insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the company from its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
generally  for life insurance subsidiaries domiciled or commercially domiciled in the united states  that limitation equals the greater of i ten percent of an insurer s statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end  or ii the statutory net gain from operations  excluding realized investment gains and losses  of the preceding year 
the payment of dividends to the company from its insurance subsidiaries is further limited to the amount of statutory unassigned surplus 
the company also has the ability to draw a dividend from its united kingdom based affiliate  unum limited 
such dividends are limited in amount  based on insurance company law in the united kingdom  which requires a minimum solvency margin 
based on these restrictions under current law 
in  million was available for the payment of dividends to the company from its domestic insurance subsidiaries  and approximately million was available for the payment of dividends from unum limited  and 
in  million will be available for the payment of dividends to the company from its domestic insurance subsidiaries  and approximately million will be available for the payment of dividends from unum limited 
the ability of the company to continue to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval will be dependent upon the level of earnings of its insurance subsidiaries as calculated under law 
in addition to regulatory restrictions  the amount of dividends that will be paid by insurance subsidiaries will depend on additional factors  such as risk based capital ratios  funding growth objectives at an affiliate level  and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support the ratings desired by the company 
regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution to the company from its non insurance subsidiaries 
at december   the company had short term and long term debt totaling million and  million  respectively 
at december   approximately million was available for additional financing under the company s revolving credit facilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
the company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments 
the company uses interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair values of mortgage loans and held to maturity securities  which are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost  would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and by approximately million and million  respectively  at december  the fair values of policy loans  which are also reported at amortized cost  would decrease approximately million at december   assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates 
during  over percent of the policy loan portfolio was ceded to a reinsurer on a percent indemnity coinsurance basis see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impact from interest rate risk on the fair values of policy loans net of ceding was immaterial at december  at december  and  assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels  the fair values of the company s long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities would increase approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a matrix pricing system whereby all securities are priced with the resulting market rates and spreads assuming a change of basis points 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values of long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because the company actively manages its investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk the company is also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its foreign operations and certain investment securities dominated in those local currencies 
foreign operations represented percent and percent of total assets at december  and  respectively  and percent and percent of total revenue for and  respectively 
assuming foreign exchange rates decreased percent from the december  and levels  year end and stockholders equity would not be materially affected
