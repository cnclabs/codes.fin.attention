item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leader in the design  manufacture  sale and service of structural process management solutions for the high growth segments of the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets 
structural process management solutions consist of systems that use charged particle beam technology to measure  analyze  diagnose and modify sub micron  multi dimensional structures found in semiconductors  data storage components  biological samples and industrial compounds 
our products include electron microscopes  focused ion beam  or fib  systems  and dualbeam systems that combine an fib column with a scanning electron microscope in a single system 
our customers include leading semiconductor and data storage manufacturers  as well as educational and research institutions and industrial companies located throughout the world 
we also design  manufacture and sell components of electron microscopes and fib systems to a limited number of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers 
we have research and development and manufacturing operations located in hillsboro  oregon  peabody  massachusetts  eindhoven  the netherlands  and brno  czech republic 
we have sales and service subsidiaries in countries located throughout north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
we also use independent agents to sell some of our products in various countries  particularly in the asia pacific region 
fei was founded in to design and manufacture charged particle emitters ion and electron sources 
we began manufacturing and selling ion and electron focusing columns in the early s and began manufacturing fib workstations in in we manufactured and sold our first dualbeam systems 
in we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of philips electron optics division  a manufacturer of electron microscopes headquartered in eindhoven  the netherlands in exchange for of our common stock outstanding after issuance 
as a result of this transaction  we became a majority owned subsidiary of philips 
the combination with philips gave us expanded research and development capabilities  increased manufacturing capacity  a worldwide sales and service organization and additional financial resources 
in we acquired micrion corporation  a manufacturer of single beam fib systems headquartered in peabody  massachusetts 
the acquisition of micrion broadened our product lines  added research and development strength and expanded our sales and service capabilities in the us  japan and taiwan 
we expect to continue to expand our business in the future through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and partnerships 
since  we have experienced growth across all business segments  geographic territories and target end markets 
growth drivers for our business in the semiconductor industry include shrinking feature geometries  the transition to copper and new dielectrics  the transition to millimeter size wafers and shortening product life cycles 
in the data storage market  our growth is being driven by the need to measure  analyze and modify increasingly smaller sub surface features and by the need to trim smaller size pole tips for writing data to the disk surface 
in the industry and institute markets  our growth is being driven by the growing need for ultra high resolution and expanding research into biological structures 
notwithstanding these factors  a downturn in general economic conditions in the us or in the markets for our customers products could result in a reduction in demand for our products 
we make no assurances that we will be able to maintain or exceed our current level of sales in any downturn 
our standard billing terms usually include a holdback of to percent of the total selling price until completion of the installation and final acceptance of our equipment at the customer s site 
effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy to defer the portion of revenue related to installation and final acceptance until the installation and final acceptance are completed 
this change was made in accordance with the implementation of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab previously  we had recognized percent of revenue for products when title passed to the customer 
the effect of this change  net of income taxes  is reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the results of operations for this net effect reflects the deferral as of january  of million of revenue previously recognized 
we recognized all of this million in revenue during the year ended december  sab had a negative effect on our reported revenues of million for  and we expect it to continue to reduce reported revenues in the future 
we also receive revenue from services provided to our customers 
revenue from time and materials based service arrangements is recognized as the service is performed 
revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new applications of our technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest heavily in research and development and in sales and marketing in advance of generating revenue related to these investments 
additionally  we sometimes loan equipment to customers for their use in evaluating our products 
we have also engaged in joint application development arrangements with some of our customers 
we make no assurances that these efforts will result in the sale of our equipment to these customers 
we expect to continue these practices in the future 
our customer base is diverse  but we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from sales to a few key customers  and we expect that trend to continue 
sales to our top customers accounted for of our total net sales in and of our total net sales in  however  no one customer exceeded of our net sales for either or many of our microelectronics and electron optics products carry high sales values 
our systems range in list price from about million to million 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of units and we expect that trend to continue 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a single order could have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for a given reporting period 
a substantial portion of our net sales have generally been realized near the end of each quarter and sales of electron optics products to government funded customers have generally been significantly higher in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  delays in shipments near the end of a quarter could have a substantial negative effect on operating results for that quarter 
announcements by our competitors or us of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing systems  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the us  and we expect that trend to continue 
total net sales outside the us were in  in and in in addition to the us dollar  we conduct significant business in euros  british pounds  and japanese yen 
because of our substantial research and development and manufacturing operations in europe  we incur a greater proportion of our costs in europe than the revenue we derive from that geographic region 
our raw materials  labor and other manufacturing costs are primarily denominated in us dollars  euros and czech korunas 
this situation has the effect of improving our gross margins and results of operations when the dollar strengthens in relation to the euro or koruna  as was the case in and a weakening of the dollar in relation to the euro or czech koruna would have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
movement of asian currencies in relation to the dollar and euro can also affect our reported sales and results of operations because we derive a greater proportion of revenue from the asia pacific region than the costs we incur there 
we attempt to mitigate our currency translation and transaction exposures by using forward exchange contracts and by borrowing in multiple currencies 
we also negotiate the selling currency for our products with our customers to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations 
our gross margins have improved over the last two years due to several factors 
the most significant factor has been the change in our product mix 
in general  our microelectronics products carry higher gross margins than our electron optics products  and microelectronics products have increased from of our net sales in to of our net sales in we expect the proportion of microelectronics product sales to continue to increase in the future 
in addition to shifts in product mix and the favorable effect of exchange rate fluctuations mentioned above  our gross margins have been positively affected by increased production volume  greater factory overhead absorption and lower manufacturing costs from outsourcing certain subassemblies 
our service segment gross margins have been positively affected by improved economies of scale from an increase in our installed base of systems  and negatively affected by the additional sales  distribution and service operations we purchased from philips in december  which have lower average service business gross margins than our other larger and more established service operations 
in addition to the factors discussed above  we expect that potential pricing pressure from competitors that introduce new products into our markets may adversely affect our gross margins in the future 
we derive significant benefits from our relationship with philips 
these benefits include access to patents and intellectual property and research and development services  participation in philips collective bargaining agreements and pension plans  participation in philips insurance programs  the philips credit facility  access to philips information technology systems and export and purchasing services provided by philips 
on the earlier of days after philips business electronics ownership falls below of our outstanding common stock or days after philips no longer includes fei in its consolidated group for financial reporting purposes  we expect to begin to incur additional labor and operating costs in an aggregate amount of approximately million to million per year 
these costs will be partially offset by payments to us from philips of up to million over a three year period pursuant to our agreement with philips 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of purchased goodwill and technology purchased in process research and development costs restructuring and reorganization costs operating income loss other expense  net income loss before taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle tax expense benefit income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss net sales net sales include sales in our microelectronics  electron optics  components and service segments 
net sales in increased million compared to net sales in increased million compared to the acquisition of micrion  completed in august  contributed million to net sales and million to net sales 
the acquisition of the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in december contributed million to net sales 
microelectronics segment sales increased million in compared to of this increase  million was attributable to the acquisition of micrion  which was included in our results of operations for all of compared to only five months in microelectronics segment sales increased million in compared to of this increase  million was attributable to the acquisition of micrion 
the development of new applications for our products as well as increased acceptance and penetration in the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets has contributed to increased demand and sales volume for this segment 
in addition  industry conditions in both the semiconductor manufacturing sector and the data storage sectors were generally stronger in and than in electron optics segment sales increased million in compared to we began shipping a new series of tem products under the tecnai name in and strong demand for these products resulted in a increase in tem sales 
tem sales increased in in the industry and institute market  as well as in the semiconductor market 
sales of our sem products increased from to electron optics segment product sales increased million in compared to our tem sales increase in over from the new tecnai product line was partially offset by a reduction in sem sales in compared to  primarily due to increased competition 
components segment sales increased million in compared to demand for our component products by our oem customers increased sharply in late and continued through  as customers increased their production requirements 
sales in the components segment decreased million in compared to the demand for components segment products was weak in the first half of due to customers utilization of on hand inventories 
service sales increased million in compared to service sales increased million in compared to the acquisition of the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in december added million to service segment revenues and million to service segment revenues 
in addition  the acquisition of micrion in august contributed to our growth in service segment sales in both and the remaining increases in service segment revenues were primarily the result of an increase in the number of systems in our installed base 
in addition  we increased sales in the semiconductor and data storage markets and the customers in these markets tend to have higher demands for service response time 
in general  our service contracts carry higher prices as the guaranteed response time is shortened 
year ended december  net sales by geographic region north america europe asia pacific rest of world net sales increased from to in each of the three major geographic regions in which we sell north america  europe  and asia pacific 
in north america  sales increased by million from to primarily due to increased demand for our products in the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets in that region 
in europe  sales increased by million from to primarily due to increased demand in the semiconductor industry and strong demand for our new tecnai tem products 
service revenues also increased in europe due to the acquisition of the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in december as well as the increased installed base of systems 
in the asia pacific region  sales increased by million from to primarily due to increased demand in the semiconductor and data storage industries in that region 
from to  sales in north america increased million  sales in europe increased million and sales in the asia pacific region increased million 
the increase in sales in north america was primarily due to increased demand in the semiconductor industry in that region 
the increase in sales in europe was primarily due to increased service revenue resulting from the increase in our installed base of systems and also the acquisition of the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in december sales increased in the asia pacific region in primarily due to increased demand for our products in the data storage industry in that region 
our billing terms on equipment sales generally include a holdback of to percent of the total purchase price subject to completion of the installation and final acceptance process at the customer site 
effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy to defer the portion of the billing related to installation and final acceptance until the installation and final acceptance are completed 
this change was made in accordance with sab the effect of this change was to reduce reported sales revenue for by million 
gross profit cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as materials  labor both direct and indirect and factory overhead  as well as all of the costs of our customer service function such as labor  materials  travel and overhead 
gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  was in  in  and in the gross margin was negatively affected by the change in our revenue recognition policy in accordance with sab without this effect  the gross margin would have been 
the gross margin was negatively affected by million of non cash inventory step up adjustments related to the micrion acquisition 
without these purchase accounting effects  the gross margin would have been in during the third quarter of  we recognized charges totaling million in cost of sales for inventory write offs  obsolescence reserves  reserves for product upgrades and increased warranty reserves 
excluding the effect of these charges  the gross margin would have been 
the improvement in our gross margin over the last three years is primarily attributable to changes in product mix 
in addition  more favorable factory overhead absorption from higher production volumes contributed to improved gross margins 
lower manufacturing costs from outsourcing various manufacturing activities in and for several mechanical and electrical subassemblies also contributed to the increase in gross margins 
our gross margin has also improved from to as a result of the weakening of european currencies compared to the us dollar 
our service segment experienced a decrease in gross margin from to primarily due to the impact of the additional sales  distribution and service operations purchased from philips in december  which have lower average service business gross margins than our other larger and more established service operations 
research and development costs research and development  or r d  costs include labor  materials  overhead and payments to philips and other third parties incurred in research and development of new products and new software  or enhancements to existing products and software 
r d costs increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to as a percentage of sales  r d costs were  and for  and  respectively 
the acquisition of micrion in august added million of r d costs in  and million of r d costs in r d costs are reported net of subsidies and capitalized software development costs 
these offsets totaled million in  million in  and million in excluding the effects of these offsets and the effect of the micrion acquisition  r d costs increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to we are continuing to invest in the development of product improvements and upgrades  new software systems and new products to broaden the product line offerings of our business segments 
we expect to continue to increase our total r d expenditures in the near term 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative  or sg a  costs include labor  travel and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
sg a costs include sales commissions paid to our employees as well as to our agents 
sg a costs for increased million compared to  and increased million in compared to as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in  in  and in the increase in sg a costs from to was partially due to the acquisition of micrion and the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in sg a costs also increased in dollar amount from to as a result of higher sales volumes 
the decrease in sg a costs as a percentage of sales from to is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and the fact that many sg a costs are fixed or semi fixed rather than variable in nature 
the increase in sg a costs in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of micrion in august  as well as the acquisition of the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips 
amortization of purchased goodwill and technology purchase accounting for the acquisition of philips electron optics division in resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that is being amortized over a year period 
purchase accounting for the micrion acquisition in august resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that is being amortized over a year period 
amortization of purchased goodwill and technology for increased million compared to  reflecting months amortization from the micrion acquisition compared to approximately four months amortization in amortization of purchased goodwill and technology increased by million in compared to as a result of the micrion acquisition 
read also note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
purchased in process research and development in connection with the purchase accounting for the micrion acquisition  we identified four significant projects under development at the date of the acquisition 
two of those projects represented enhancements to the resolution and automation of existing products designed primarily for the semiconductor industry 
the third project represented enhancements to the automation of products for the data storage industry 
the fourth project represented development efforts on products for the lithography photo mask repair market 
none of these projects had been proven technologically feasible or had generated revenue as of the date of the evaluation 
in accordance with our policy to expense research and development costs as they are incurred  we recorded a one time charge of million associated with the write off of acquired in process r d immediately after the closing of the micrion acquisition 
read also note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
restructuring and reorganization costs in we implemented a restructuring and reorganization program to consolidate operations  eliminate redundant facilities  reduce operating expenses and provide for outsourcing of various manufacturing activities 
the program provided for the elimination of approximately positions worldwide  or about of our work force as of july  the charge of million recognized in represented the cost of providing severance  outplacement assistance and associated benefits to affected employees  as well as moving and lease abandonment costs associated with closing duplicate facilities 
the charge of million recognized in represented the cost of relocating various office facilities 
read also note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
other income expense  net interest income for  and represents interest earned on the short term temporary investment of excess cash 
the increase in interest income in compared to  and compared to  is primarily the result of increased principal invested as well as higher average interest rates 
interest expense for the same periods represents interest incurred on borrowings under our bank line of credit facilities and on borrowings from philips under the philips credit facility 
interest expense increased in compared with  reflecting higher levels of borrowing and higher average interest rates 
the interest expense generally reflects higher levels of borrowing offset by lower interest rates under the philips credit facility as compared to our borrowings 
in september  we reduced to zero the carrying value of our cost method investment in norsam technologies  inc and  accordingly  recorded a million valuation adjustment 
we revised our projections of future cash flows that we expected to receive from this investment based on norsam s operating results and its divestiture of various operating assets 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for and for our effective tax rate in those years differed from the us federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of the amortization of intangible assets not deductible for income tax purposes as well as the effects of state and foreign taxes and our use of a foreign sales corporation for exports from the us  among other factors 
for  our effective tax rate was negative due primarily to the nondeductible write off of purchased in process research and development costs  as well as the other factors mentioned above 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy to defer the portion of the billing related to installation and final acceptance at the customer site until the installation and final acceptance are completed 
this change was made in accordance with sab the effect of this change  net of income taxes  is reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the year ended december  this net effect reflects the deferral as of january  of million of revenue previously recognized 
all such revenue initially deferred on january  upon adoption of sab was recognized during liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by million in to million as of december  in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million as of december  net cash provided by operations was million in  higher than the million provided by operations in  which was higher than the million provided by operations in excluding the effects of changes in working capital components  operating activities generated million of cash in and million in  and used million of cash in the improved cash flow from operations was primarily due to improved operating results over this three year period 
accounts receivable increased million from to and million from to the increase in receivables was due to increased sales volume for both periods  and for  also a result of the acquisitions of micrion and the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  improved from days at the end of to days at the end of changing our revenue recognition policy in accordance with sab reduced the recorded balance of accounts receivable as of december  by million 
without this change in revenue recognition policy  our dso would have been days for the year ended december  inventories increased million from to and million from to the increase in was primarily due to the two acquisitions completed in that year 
during we were able to manage our inventory levels more effectively despite the growth in our sales  and improved our inventory turnover rate from in to in current liabilities increased million from to and million from to these increases resulted from growth in our business as well as the two acquisitions 
we incurred capital expenditures for acquisition of equipment of million in  million in and million in these expenditures included application laboratory and demonstration systems  which exhibit the capabilities of our equipment to our customers and potential customers 
we have expanded our demonstration capabilities over the last three years 
the lower capital spending level in was in anticipation of the business combination with micrion  which added both domestic and offshore application laboratory and demonstration equipment 
we also invest in equipment for development  manufacturing and testing purposes 
we lease the real property used in our business 
we expect capital expenditures in to increase to between million and million 
we also invest in internally developed software  which controls our equipment and provides information from the equipment for use by customers 
we capitalized software development costs of million in  million in and million in we also expect these expenditures to increase in the near term as we introduce new products and add new applications to our existing products 
during we made several business investments in addition to ongoing investments in equipment and product development 
the largest of these investments was the august purchase of micrion 
purchase consideration for this transaction  including transaction costs  consisted of cash and shares of our common stock totaling million 
the cash portion of the purchase price  paid to micrion s former shareholders  totaled million 
in september we invested million to acquire a interest in surface interface  a start up company  which introduced an atomic force microscopy tool for the semiconductor industry 
in conjunction with the investment  we entered into a distribution agreement through which we market  sell and service the equipment 
we also obtained an option to purchase additional equity at a predetermined price 
in june we invested an additional million in surface interface  bringing our ownership percentage to as of december  in december we acquired additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in a number of smaller market areas 
purchase consideration included a cash payment of million to philips  which was recorded as a dividend because the transaction was between entities under common control 
we expect to continue to use acquisition and investment opportunities to augment our growth and market position 
we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement on february  with philips 
we used this facility to pay off the balance and terminate our previous credit facility 
in august the philips credit facility was amended  increasing our borrowing capacity to million 
the philips credit facility matures on february  the credit facility terminates on the earlier of days after philips business electronics ownership falls below of our outstanding common stock or days after philips no longer includes fei in its consolidated group for financial reporting purposes 
the funds may be drawn either in the us or offshore in a choice of three currencies 
under terms of the agreement  we must comply with customary banking terms and conditions  including financial covenants that require specific minimum equity levels and minimum operating income to interest expense ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants in the agreement 
interest on the outstanding balance is based on an applicable libor rate for one  three or six months at our option plus 
as of december   borrowings under the credit facility were million  providing unused credit capacity of million 
we also maintain a million unsecured and uncommitted bank borrowing facility in the us and various limited facilities in selected foreign countries 
in addition  we maintain a million unsecured and uncommitted bank facility in the us for the purpose of issuing standby letters of credit 
in august  in connection with the acquisition of micrion  we sold  shares to philips business electronics in a private transaction providing million in net proceeds to us 
we also issue shares to fund our employee stock purchase plan  which enables employees to purchase our stock at a discount to market price at fixed points in time 
we also grant options to purchase our shares to many of our employees and directors as part of incentive and other compensation programs 
during   shares were sold or granted under these programs  as compared to  shares sold or granted in and  shares sold or granted in we assess liquidity needs by evaluating cash balances on hand  available borrowings under our credit facilities  working capital trends and expected cash flows from operating activities versus our investment needs 
in consideration of these factors  we believe that we have adequate financial resources for at least the next months 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas no 
the statement requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  because of our minimal use of derivatives  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our earnings or financial position 
backlog our backlog consists of purchase orders we have received for products and services we expect to ship and deliver within the next months 
at december  our total backlog was million 
at december  our total backlog was million 
we expect to ship all products and deliver all services represented by this backlog in  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
customers may cancel or delay delivery on previously placed orders  although our standard terms and conditions include penalties for cancellations made close to the scheduled delivery date 
a substantial portion of our backlog relates to orders for products with a relatively high average selling price 
as a result  the timing of the receipt of orders or the shipment of products could have a significant impact on our backlog at any date 
for this and other reasons  the amount of backlog at any date is not necessarily indicative of revenue in future periods 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated financial data for each of the eight quarters in and in our opinion  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial information appearing in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  except for the adjustments described in the following paragraphs  necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for these periods 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the results for the three months ended april  include restructuring and reorganization charges of million 
the results for the three months ended october  include a charge of million for estimated purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisition of micrion 
the results for the three months ended december  include a charge of million for the final purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisition of micrion 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we changed our accounting method for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of the year ended december   effective january   in accordance with the requirements of sab accordingly  the following unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for the first three quarters of fiscal have been restated to reflect the impact of the change in accounting principle as if it had been adopted on january  the results for the three months ended april   include the cumulative effect of implementing sab april as previously reported april as restated july as previously reported july as restated october as previously reported october as restated december in thousands  except per share data net sales       cost of sales      gross profit      total operating expenses     operating income      other income expense  net income before taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense      income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net income loss      income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle per share basic diluted shares used in per share calculation basic       diluted       april july october december in thousands  except per share data net sales     cost of sales     gross profit     total operating expenses     operating income loss    other income expense  net income loss before taxes     income tax expense  net income loss   income loss per share basic diluted shares used in per share calculation basic     diluted     our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of our microelectronics and electron optics products  competitive pricing pressures  conditions in our principal markets  the timing of orders from major customers and new product introductions  customer cancellation or delay of shipments  long sales cycles  changes in the mix of products sold and the proportion of domestic and international sales  specific feature requests by customers  product delays and supply chain difficulties and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of microelectronics and electron optics products 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a single order could have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for a reporting period 
a substantial portion of our net sales have generally been realized near the end of each quarter and sales of electron optics products to government funded customers have generally been significantly higher in the fourth quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a large portion of our business is conducted outside of the us through a number of foreign subsidiaries 
each of the foreign subsidiaries keeps its accounting records in its respective local currency 
these local currency denominated accounting records are translated at exchange rates which fluctuate up or down from period to period and consequently affect the consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the major foreign currencies in which we face periodic fluctuations are the euro and the related underlying european currencies and the czech koruna 
although for each of the last three years more than of our sales occurred outside of the us  a large portion of these foreign sales were denominated in us dollars and euros dutch guilders in 
as a result  despite an overall strengthening of the us dollar against european currencies in  net sales were not materially affected since the impact of the strengthening of the us dollar against european currencies was offset by the impact of the dollar weakening against the japanese yen 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity and comprehensive income for by million 
our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates results from intercompany loans made between the us and dutch subsidiaries and its other foreign subsidiaries 
we hedge our investment in a japanese subsidiary but do not otherwise actively hedge this exposure 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
from time to time we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific receivables or payables positions 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these contracts was million 
holding other variables constant  if the us dollar weakened by  the market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
the decrease in value would be substantially offset from the revaluation of the underlying hedged transactions 
interest rate sensitivity we borrow funds under variable rate borrowing arrangements 
as of december  and during the entirety of  we did not hedge our exposure to interest rate risk 
we would not experience a material impact on our income before taxes as the result of a increase in the short term interest rates that are used to calculate our interest expense
