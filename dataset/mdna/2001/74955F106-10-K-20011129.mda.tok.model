item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business rfm designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of radio frequency components and modules 
the company s products are organized into two groups the communications products group and the low power products group 
the communications products group includes frequency control modules and filter products 
the low power products group includes low power components  as well as virtual wire r short range radio products 
the company s products are based on saw technology  and the company s strategy is to leverage its radio frequency design skills and its packaging technology to provide saw based solutions to the current and emerging needs of the electronics industry 
the company s products include more than resonators  filters  oscillators  transceivers  transmitters and receivers 
the company s average selling prices within these product lines generally range from 
to for low power products and from to for communications products 
results of operations the following discussion relates to the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended august  current year or fiscal  in comparison to the fiscal year ended august  prior year or fiscal  as well as the fiscal year ended august  fiscal 
in addition  there is discussion of the financial statements for the three months ended august  fourth quarter  in comparison to the three months ended august  comparable quarter of the prior year  as well as the three months ended may  previous quarter 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended august i the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of operations to total sales and ii the percentage change in these items from year to year percentage of sales year to year change to to sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring litigation total operating expenses income loss from operations  other income expense  net income loss before income taxes  income tax benefit expense  net income loss  sales the following table sets forth the components of the company s sales and percentage relationship of the components to total sales for the periods indicated year ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales low power product group low power components    virtual wire r radio produc    subtotal    communications products group frequency control modules    filters    subtotal    total product sales    technology development sales total sales    sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s base low power components business remained constant  but all the other product lines combined increased almost  primarily due to an increased number of units sold of those products 
in the past several years  the company has concentrated its product development and sales promotion efforts on the virtual wire r  frequency control and filter product lines 
the increase in sales in fiscal is a result of increased market acceptance of the new products that have been developed for those product lines 
sales previously decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in number of units sold of low power component products 
low power components sales decreased in fiscal as a result of a decrease in the number of units shipped  primarily due to a change in the company s sales policy largely occurring in the company s first quarter 
the company decided not to offer special promotions programs to increase its turns business because of the impact the programs have had on the company s long term gross margins 
this decision decreased sales in all product lines in the first quarter  but particularly low power components 
in addition  average selling prices for low power components products declined from the prior year due to continuing competitive pressures 
during fiscal and fiscal  however  the average selling prices for low power component products stabilized due to the company s decision to discontinue special promotions programs and various other efforts by the company 
the company believes that the markets for its low power component products are still competitive and have attracted large international competitors  particularly for the automotive segment 
this increase in competition has resulted in lower average selling prices 
the company believes that the lower average selling prices may continue to offset results from an increase in the number of additional units sold 
therefore  sales for low power components may not increase or maintain the same level in future periods 
sales for virtual wire r short range radio products increased in fiscal year  while they decreased in fiscal in both years  sales were favorably impacted by an increase in the number of units sold for these products as they achieved greater acceptance in the marketplace 
in the prior year  average selling prices for these products decreased as the products reached higher volume price points  which resulted in a small overall decrease in sales 
during the year  the company completed the transition of customers from the first generation version to the second generation version of these products 
the second generation version of the products are designed to be more cost effective and provide additional performance 
the company intends to continue working with its customers to develop new applications using virtual wire r short range radio products 
the timing of any sales resulting from such new applications is dependent upon the customers product development and product introduction cycles 
it is difficult to predict when  or if  these new products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
filter sales increased in fiscal  compared to an increase of in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of units sold in each year 
the company has increased its engineering resources in this area and has developed new products 
the increase in number of units sold reflects success in several of these programs 
the company expects to continue investing in development of new filter products and believes the rapidly growing wireless communications markets they serve represent a positive growth opportunity 
filter products have a long development and introduction cycle and there can be no assurance as to when or if this focus on filter products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
frequency control module sales increased in fiscal compared to a decrease of in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the introduction of a new line of optical timing products based upon patented technology that targets the optical dense wave division multiplex dwdm marketplace 
the company believes that products serving the optical network market represent a positive growth opportunity and introduced a surface mount version of these products in the fourth quarter 
however  the optical timing products are primarily directed at the telecommunications market which has suffered a general economic downturn in the past year and it is not certain when or if these new products will have a significant impact on the company s sales 
the reduction in sales in fiscal was primarily due to a reduced number of units sold for several types of older products and the company expects that demand for these older products may not return to former levels or may continue to decline 
the company s top five customers accounted for approximately   and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
distribution related customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
one customer accounted for or more of total sales in fiscal  while no customers accounted for or more for fiscal years and insight electronics is the company s domestic distributor and accounted for of total sales in fiscal year the company s sales strategy is to seek diversification in its customer base  however  due to the very competitive nature of the markets in which it competes  the company is not certain it will be able to continue to achieve this diversification 
international sales primarily in europe and asia were approximately  and of the company s total sales during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company considers all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
these sales are denominated primarily in us currency  although some european customers will require the company to price in euros in calendar year the company intends to continue its focus on international sales and anticipates that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
international sales are subject to fluctuations as a result of local economic conditions and competition  and the company cannot predict whether it will continue to derive a significant portion of its business from international sales 
while the company has achieved sales increases in prior periods  there can be no assurance that this can be achieved in future periods 
the company s success is highly dependent on achieving technological advances in its product design and manufacturing capabilities at both the dallas and offshore locations  as well as its ability to sell its products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors such as economic and regulatory conditions 
competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating the company s technologies may adversely affect selling prices and market share 
gross profit margin gross profit margin increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal the increase in current year gross margin resulted from the initial impact of the company s program to reduce manufacturing costs 
there are several elements to the cost reduction program 
the first element is the move of volume assembly operations offshore to contract manufacturing alliances 
the company believes a successful offshore manufacturing program could result in a material reduction in manufacturing costs 
during the current fiscal year  considerable progress has been made toward this goal 
by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s offshore manufactures assembled more than of all shipments  measured by revenue 
the company expects that the balance of the low power component production will be moved offshore by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year in addition  the company entered into a manufacturing service contract with morioka seiko instruments  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of seiko instruments  inc  for assembly of its virtual wire r products 
the company expects the seiko manufacturing arrangement to be in full production by the third quarter of fiscal year at that time  the company expects most of its shipments to be from offshore sources 
the second element of the cost reduction program is to reduce costs in the company s dallas operations 
the company reduced its dallas workforce  including contract labor  during fiscal and expects further reductions by the end of november most of the reductions were related to the transition to offshore manufacturing 
the majority of this reduction occurred late in the fourth quarter of fiscal  so the anticipated favorable impact will be in fiscal year the last element of the cost reduction program is to transition the company s virtual wire r customers to more cost effective second generation products 
this was largely completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal the company incurred a great deal of cost in making this transition 
largely due to this conversion  both the current year and the prior year cost of sales included approximately million in special inventory charges related to elimination of product lines and transition to offshore manufacturing 
the company believes that the net result of the cost reductions completed or planned will result in an improvement in gross margins to or more of sales in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal given the complexities of the manufacturing processes involved  however  there can be no assurance that the offshore program will be successful 
the decline of gross margins in fiscal year from to was the result of three factors 
first  the sales prices for the low power component products declined due to competitive pressures in the market place 
this decline in average selling price was not matched by a decrease in per unit manufacturing costs 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company changed its sales strategy to no longer offer special promotions programs to increase its turns business 
this change has had the effect of stabilizing prices for its low power component products 
currently  these products are still sold in a very competitive market and it is not certain that a strategy to seek stable prices will allow the company to increase or even maintain its sales levels 
if selling prices need to be reduced to maintain sales levels  it is not certain if the company can reduce per unit manufacturing costs in future periods to the same extent as the decrease in selling prices 
if that were to occur  gross margins would be materially and adversely impacted 
the second factor causing decreased margins was a decline in sales volume in fiscal year that resulted in higher fixed overhead costs as a percentage of sales 
in addition  the company added equipment and other manufacturing overhead costs to increase the capacity in its facilities to handle both new products and an increased volume of its older products 
as a result  overhead costs as a percentage of sales increased significantly in fiscal a significant target of the company s ongoing cost reduction program is to reduce fixed manufacturing costs 
if that were not successful  overhead costs would remain at high levels and could increase as a percentage of sales 
the last factor resulting in lower margins was million in special charges to cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal year  primarily related to the transition to new products 
the company has in the past experienced sudden increases in demand  which have put pressure on its manufacturing facilities to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in the current year for instance  the company experienced some difficulty in securing the additional labor resources necessary to meet rising demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than the company currently possesses 
the company has converted the majority of its assembly manufacturing requirements to offshore contractors 
the company may not be able to increase its manufacturing capacity  the manufacturing capacity of its assembly contractors  or improve its manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this would result in a loss of potential sales in the periods impacted 
research and development research and development expenses decreased approximately  in fiscal and million in fiscal the current year s decrease was caused by the following factors 
first  an additional  in costs were reclassified to cost of sales related to technology development sales contracts which increased in fiscal and second  personnel costs have been reduced  primarily due to reallocations from engineering design functions to manufacturing process engineering and manufacturing management functions to improve manufacturing output and efficiency and to support the offshore transition 
third  expenses in fiscal included approximately  in tooling depreciation expense that did not recur in fiscal the reduction in research and development expense in fiscal was primarily due to an unusually high level of expenses that occurred in fiscal year included in these expenses were approximately  related to the introduction of a new packaging process and approximately  related to the costs of the transceiver product introduction 
since these unusual costs did not recur in fiscal  this also accounted for the majority of the decrease compared to in addition  in fiscal there was an increase of approximately  in engineering costs included in cost of sales related to an increase in technology development sales 
the company believes that the continued development of its technology and new products is essential to its success and is committed to continuing its investment in research and development 
the company expects its investments in research and development to remain approximately the same or increase in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
sales and marketing in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately  from the prior year  due primarily to a change in the company s program to reduce commission rates 
sales and marketing expenses increased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in sales commission expense resulting from the company s efforts to increase sales by expanding the geographic and account responsibilities of its sales representative firms 
over the past several years the company has conducted an ongoing review of its sales representation program and feels it now has an optimum coverage and rate structure 
sales and marketing expenses were of sales in fiscal  which is the same as they were in fiscal the company expects to incur comparable sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars over the next several quarters  with the exception of sales commission expenses that will fluctuate in line with sales levels 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  in fiscal year after increasing approximately  in fiscal the increase in was primarily attributable to approximately  in employee severance costs 
comparable charges in are classified as restructuring costs 
general and administrative expenses were of total sales in fiscal and were the same in fiscal the company recently reduced general and administrative expenses and expects they will continue to decline slightly or remain constant in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
restructuring restructuring expenses were approximately million in fiscal compared to zero in the prior two years 
restructuring expenses consist of the following 
first  a fixed asset charge of million was taken to write down or write off fixed assets that will no longer be required due to the decision to close a portion of the dallas operations 
second  a charge of  was taken to cover the severance costs of employees whose positions have been or will be eliminated by the manufacturing restructuring 
the company anticipates the related manufacturing changes will be fully implemented by the end of the first quarter of fiscal litigation litigation expense  which amounted to zero in fiscal and  in fiscal  primarily consists of expenses related to the resolution of several unrelated legal issues 
all of the matters have been resolved and the company does not anticipate similar expenses in future periods  except for immaterial expenses incurred in the ordinary course of its operations 
other income expense during the current year the company refinanced its operations with a banking agreement that resulted in the purchase of equipment that was formerly leased 
the additional debt and interest expense incurred from this purchase were partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses due to the elimination of related equipment rental expense 
other expense primarily consisted of interest expense on the company s debt  including amendment fees  and increased approximately  in the current year due to the increase in debt 
other expense increased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased indebtedness  resulting in an increase in interest expense 
the company expects that borrowings will remain at comparable levels over the next several quarters resulting in a stable level of other expense  except for any reduction in interest rates due to a reduction in the prime rate as provided in the bank agreement 
income tax expense benefit fas requires companies to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets unless their realization is more likely than not based upon historical data 
in fiscal year  the company experienced its second consecutive year of losses which included various restructuring charges that occurred in the fourth quarter 
in consideration of those loss years and the uncertain economic environment  the company decided to fully reserve  in a noncash charge  all tax benefits that had been recorded  which amounted to approximately million at the end of the third quarter 
therefore  the company s tax provision for the fiscal year was a million expense  compared to a million benefit in the prior year 
the potential tax savings from the loss carryforwards are still available to the company however 
therefore  income in future periods for the foreseeable future will largely be shielded from taxation 
this will improve both reported earnings and cash flow in the future 
earnings per share the net loss for the current year was million  compared to a million loss in the prior year and net income of  in fiscal the company s diluted loss per share for fiscal was per share  compared to per share for fiscal and net income of 
per share for fiscal the current year earnings per share includes the effect of all the special charges that occurred in the fourth quarter of the current year 
fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note of the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter of million decreased approximately  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
sales were also down approximately compared to the previous third quarter in which the company had a record million in sales 
the sales decrease in the current year was primarily due to a decrease in the number of units sold in the company s product lines and reflects the general downturn in the economy 
sales of filter products to telecommunication customers were down from the previous quarter 
the company believes the impact of the general economic downturn could cause sales for the next quarter to be down another to 
the company also believes the diversity of its product offering and customer base moderates to a great extent the impact of economic changes on any particular industry or market 
gross profit margins were in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year and from the previous quarter 
included in the quarter were approximately million in special inventory charges to write off or reserve inventory resulting from the company s decision to restructure its manufacturing facilities 
without this special reserve  the gross margin for the quarter would have been approximately and comparable to the prior year 
the reduction in gross margin from the previous quarter was due to relatively high fixed overhead costs being spread over a smaller sales volume 
a key element of the company s cost reduction program is a reduction in fixed overhead costs 
a large amount of cost reduction took place late in the fourth quarter and the company believes gross margins in the first quarter of fiscal may increase to of sales or more  although there is no assurance that this will happen 
operating expenses for the fourth quarter were approximately million for the current quarter  compared to approximately million for the comparable quarter of the prior year and million for the previous quarter 
current quarter expenses included million in restructuring charges and accounts for the increases over the prior periods noted 
the prior year s fourth quarter included a  charge for litigation and unusual legal expenses that did not recur  and the previous quarter included a much larger amount of sales commissions than the current quarter  due to a much higher level of sales 
the company expects that operating expenses will continue to decline slightly in the next quarter as its cost reduction program has additional effect 
the pre tax loss for the fourth quarter was approximately million compared to a loss of million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
on a proforma basis  which excludes the special charges  the pre tax loss for the fourth quarter would have been approximately million  which reflects increased gross margins and reduced operating expenses from recent quarters that had similar sales volume 
the company expects this improvement to continue as margins improve and operating expenses decline 
diluted loss per share was in the fourth quarter  compared to a loss of 
for the comparable quarter of the prior year and 
for the previous quarter 
without the unusual expenses in the quarter  the loss for the current quarter would have been 
per diluted share 
financial condition financing arrangements in december  the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank for a credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million term note 
included in the revolving credit facility is an million loan that is supported by the export import bank exim bank 
both facilities terminate on december  the proceeds of these new loans and the sale of approximately million in short term investments were used to pay off approximately million under the prior revolving credit facility  as well as million in obligations related to an equipment collateralized operating lease facility 
as a result  the company completely satisfied its obligations to its former bank and acquired approximately million in capital assets that had formerly been utilized under operating leases 
the structure of the banking agreement ties amounts borrowed under the agreement to a borrowing base consisting of certain receivables  inventory  and fixed assets 
essentially all the assets of the company  tangible and intangible  are pledged as collateral under both facilities 
the term loan requires equal monthly payments of principal totaling  plus interest which began in january the interest rate for both facilities is over the lender s prime rate 
as part of the agreement  the bank was given a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
this credit facility contains financial covenants relating to various matters  including but not limited to minimum net worth  quarterly and monthly earnings  and limitations on changes in corporate structure  and restrictions on dividends and capital spending 
on three occasions  the company has amended the banking agreements to relax those covenants for one time fees in the aggregate amount of  as of august   the company was in compliance with the amended covenants 
although the company believes that it will continue to meet the covenants  there is no assurance that this will occur 
should there be a future covenant violation without a waiver on favorable terms  there could be a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
in december the company entered into an agreement to raise approximately  in cash by the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the sale consisted of  units 
each unit was sold at a price of and consisted of one share of common stock and a three year warrant to purchase one share of common stock at 
the agreement called for certain restrictions on the sale or further acquisition of stock by the investors  as well as the right to require registration in the future 
the proceeds of the sale of this stock will be used to support the operations of the company 
cash flows liquidity at august  consisted primarily of approximately  of cash and approximately million available under the banking agreement 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the year to date period of fiscal as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year to date period of fiscal the million improvement from year to year was primarily due to a reduction in the net loss adjusted for noncash items  which was a net use of cash of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal year this improvement is a result of the company s cost reduction program which is targeted to improve gross margins and operating expenses 
in each year the use of cash to finance a net loss was partially offset by a reduction in working capital 
the reduction in working capital was million in the current year and million in the prior year 
the company plans to maintain a positive cash flow from operations for fiscal as it did in the fourth quarter of fiscal when cash flow from operations was a positive million 
the fourth quarter  however  benefited from a million reduction in working capital due to an intensive management effort 
the company does not expect working capital reductions of this magnitude to continue 
however  the company believes that improvements in net income and the significant amount of depreciation projected will result in positive cash flow from operations 
this should allow the company to operate in a normal manner for the next fiscal year  despite a relatively low amount of cash reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
cash used in investing activities was million for the current year  primarily as a result of approximately million in capital expenditures which consisted of million that had formerly been leased and  of new items 
this was partially financed by the net sale of million in short term investments 
cash used in investing activities was million in the prior year due to million in capital expenditures offset by a net sale of million in short term investments 
the company expects to acquire up to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  consisting primarily of equipment needed for its wafer fabrication manufacturing facilities 
due to its offshore manufacturing initiative  the company does not expect to require significant additions to its assembly facilities or equipment 
net cash generated from financing activities was million in and million in in the current year  approximately million was raised from a net increase in borrowings and million in sales of stock from the equity agreement mentioned above  stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
under the company s banking agreement  all receipts on trade receivables are applied to loans that are outstanding and the company borrows funds to support its activities according to its borrowing base 
as a result  repayments on debt and borrowings are large relative to sales 
in the prior year  million was raised in a net increase in borrowings and million in sales of stock 
as of the august   the company had approximately million available under its banking agreement based upon the borrowing base at that time 
in addition  approximately million more may become available under the banking agreement if the company s borrowing base were to increase sufficiently to support increased borrowing 
however  there can be no assurance that this will happen 
while the company is completing the transition of its assembly operation to offshore sources  there could be a working capital short fall  particularly in december the company believes that cash generated from operations  if any  its cash balances and the amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements through the fiscal year to the extent that these sources of funds are insufficient to meet the company s capital or operating requirements  the company may be required to raise additional funds 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
should that occur  there could be a significant adverse impact on the company s operations
