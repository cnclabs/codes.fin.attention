item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview obie media is an out of home advertising company  which markets advertising space primarily on transit vehicles and outdoor advertising displays billboards and wallscapes 
as of november   we had exclusive agreements with transit districts in the united states and canada to operate transit advertising displays 
since our ipo in november  the number of vehicles on which we have the right to operate transit advertising displays has increased from approximately  to over  we also operate and generally own over  advertising displays on billboards and walls primarily in washington  oregon  montana  wyoming  california and idaho 
our gross revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing an increase of 
ebitda decreased from million to million in the same period  representing a decrease of 
however  the ebitda amount included a one time transit contract settlement gain of million 
the ebitda increase from to  excluding the settlement amount  was 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expense 
our significant growth since fiscal is primarily the result of i growth in our existing transit advertising business  primarily resulting from agreements with additional transit districts  ii the acquisition of p c on september   and iii the development and acquisition of new outdoor displays 
as a result of these factors  our operating performance is not necessarily comparable on a period to period basis 
we plan to continue a strategy of expanding through both internal growth and acquisitions 
our operating results are affected by general economic conditions  as well as trends in the advertising industry 
based on industry sources  in recent years outdoor advertising expenditures in the united states have increased more rapidly than total us advertising expenditures 
however  this trend may not continue and future outdoor advertising expenditures may grow more slowly than expenditures for the advertising industry as a whole 
our gross revenues are derived from the sale of advertising on out of home advertising displays  primarily on transit vehicles under our transit district agreements and on outdoor advertising displays we own or operate 
gross revenues are a function of both the occupancy of these display spaces and the rates we charge 
we focus our sales effort on maximizing occupancy levels while maintaining rate integrity in our markets 
over the past several years  our transit advertising operations have expanded more rapidly than our outdoor advertising operations 
revenues from transit advertising sales  as a percentage of gross revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal increases in our gross revenues over the last two fiscal years are primarily the result of the increased number of transit vehicles and outdoor displays on which we market advertising space and  to a lesser extent  rate increases 
net revenues represent gross revenues less agency commissions 
consistent with standard industry practice  advertising agencies working with obie media typically retain of the gross advertising revenues from their accounts 
while advertising agencies purchase the majority of the out of home advertising that we sell  we believe our focus on direct sales to accounts not served by advertising agencies has resulted in obie media recognizing agency commissions that  as a percentage of our aggregate gross revenues  are lower than the industry average 
customers represented by advertising agencies currently account for approximately of our gross revenues 
agency commissions  as a percentage of our gross revenues  have risen recently  in large part because we have obtained new transit agreements in a number of districts where the previous providers made substantially all sales through advertising agencies 
direct advertising expenses consist primarily of occupancy  production and installation  and sales costs 
occupancy expense primarily consists of two elements i payments to transit districts for the right to sell advertising displayed on their vehicles  and ii lease payments to owners of property on which our outdoor advertising structures are located 
under our transit agreements  we typically guarantee to pay the transit district the greater of a minimum stated amount or a percentage usually over of the advertising revenues generated by our use of the district s vehicles 
occupancy expense also includes the cost of illuminating outdoor displays and property taxes on the outdoor advertising structures 
production and installation expenses consist primarily of the costs of producing  shipping and installing the advertising displays 
sales expenses consist primarily of the cost of staffing our sales force 
general and administrative expenses include costs related to individual markets  as well as corporate expenses 
expenses related to individual markets include expenses for the personnel and facilities required to administer that and neighboring markets 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent personnel and facilities costs for our executive offices and centralized staff functions 
we believe that  although general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as our revenues increase  such expenses will decline as a percentage of revenues 
contract settlement represents the financial impact of the settlement reached regarding the early termination of the tri met contract 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
start up costs are the costs we incur in pursuing new transit district agreements and the costs of establishing a sales force and office in a new market prior to beginning to operate under a new agreement 
these costs consist primarily of travel expenses  various personnel costs  legal fees and the costs of preparing our proposals in response to transit district requests for proposals 
the amount of start up costs we will incur in the future will vary  both in total amount and as a percentage of revenues  depending on the number and complexity of proposals for new districts and our success in obtaining new contracts 
recent developments additional transit advertising agreements 
in december we were awarded the advertising contract for the chicago transit authority 
the contract provides for advertising space on  buses   rapid transit cars  and rail stations 
in january we were awarded the advertising contracts for san antonio  texas buses  indianapolis  indiana buses and vancouver  washington buses 
outdoor asset acquisitions 
in january and october  we acquired the outdoor assets of two companies with displays primarily in montana and wyoming 
the acquisitions added over displays to our outdoor display inventory 
the total purchase price was million cash 
we borrowed the purchase price from our lender to finance the transaction 
acquisition of p c 
in september  we acquired p c  which has operated in the out of home advertising industry for over years 
p c had agreements with transit districts covering approximately  vehicles  including districts located in hartford  stamford and new haven  connecticut  fort lauderdale and west palm beach  florida  cincinnati and cleveland  ohio  richmond  virginia  and milwaukee  wisconsin 
obie media acquired p c for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  up to  shares of our common stock and options to purchase up to  additional shares of our common stock  of which million and  shares were paid at closing  and options to purchase  shares were exercisable on the closing date 
of the remaining million of the cash purchase price   was paid on january  and the remainder will be paid as follows   on or before january   and  on or before each of january  and the remaining  shares were to be issued depending on p c s performance through november  and the unvested options were to become exercisable over years  depending on wayne schur s continued employment by us 
further  mr 
schur provided the company with a performance guarantee for fiscal years and we financed the acquisition of p c from borrowings and repaid those borrowings with a portion of the proceeds of our august stock offering discussed above 
because of p c s performance during fiscal  the option on the  shares has been forfeited  and an additional sum of approximately  is due the company 
the acquisition of p c has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  with obie media recording most of the purchase price as goodwill 
because of p c s performance during fiscal  the option on the  shares has been forfeit  and an additional sum of approximately  is due the company 
the amount of goodwill recorded has been reduced by the  adjustment  and could decrease further in depending on p c s performance 
future periods will reflect the amortization of goodwill over years 
the acquisition occurred on september  and our financial statements do not include p c operations prior to that date

typically  our results of operations are strongest in the fourth quarter and weakest in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending november our transit advertising operations are more seasonal than our outdoor advertising operations as our outdoor advertising display space  unlike our transit advertising display space  is and has been sold nearly exclusively by means of month contracts 
we believe that the seasonality of our revenues and operating results will increase as our transit advertising operations continue to expand more rapidly than our outdoor advertising operations 
this seasonality  together with fluctuations in general and regional economic conditions and the timing and expenses related to acquisitions  the obtaining of new transit agreements and other actions we have taken to implement our growth strategy  have contributed to fluctuations in our periodic operating results 
these fluctuations likely will continue 
accordingly  our results of operations in any period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements with cash from operations and revolving credit borrowings 
our working capital at november  and was million and million  respectively 
acquisitions and capital expenditures  primarily for the construction of new outdoor advertising displays  have been financed primarily with borrowed funds 
effective february  we have entered into a new financing arrangement with us bank national association 
the new arrangement provides for a million term line maturing in august of  and a million working capital line of credit available for general purposes 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
at november   obie media had outstanding borrowings of million  of which million was pursuant to the long term credit agreement   was pursuant to the agreement to acquire p c  and  on a note maturing in see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at november   available borrowing capacity under the line of credit  based on collateralized accounts  was million 
obie media s net cash provided by operations was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to approximately million used in for direct billboard acquisitions 
capital expenditures totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
capital expenditures consist primarily of the cost of building and acquiring outdoor advertising displays 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash provided in fiscal was primarily from the proceeds of our public stock offering completed in august  net of payments on long term debt  and in from the proceeds of long term debt and use of our credit line 
we expect to pursue a policy of continued growth through obtaining new transit district agreements  acquiring out of home advertising companies or assets and constructing new outdoor advertising displays 
we intend to finance our future expansion activities using a combination of internal and external sources 
we believe that internally generated funds and funds available for borrowing under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy all debt service obligations and finance our operations  including anticipated capital expenditures  but excluding possible acquisitions  through fiscal future acquisitions by obie media  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing
