item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we received our initial funding from a public issuance of ordinary shares in the united kingdom in november in may  we completed a public financing in the us resulting in the issuance of  units  each consisting of one ordinary share and one a and one b warrant for the purchase of an equivalent number of ordinary shares 
the ordinary shares were issued as american depositary shares  evidenced by american depositary receipts  and together with the a and b warrants  were traded under the nasdaq automated quotations system 
 unexercised a and  unexercised b warrants ceased trading upon the lapsing of their respective extended exercise dates in may since may  we have relied on private placements of ordinary shares  convertible debentures and warrants to add to our capital base 
our accounts set forth in part iv of this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
our financial information included in this form k is presented in us dollars 
material changes in financial condition during the year ended december   our liquid position  represented by cash and deposits at banks and liquid investments  decreased by  to  this decrease is attributable to the excess of operational losses  movements in net working capital which included the payment of past due liabilities including commitments under supply and capital projects and other contractual obligations incurred by previous management and capital expenditure over the receipt of kinetin license fees and proceeds from the exercise of stock options as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 
significant trends a substantial decrease in our operating and net losses and a marked improvement in our current ratio were the major financial highlights in in thousands operating loss    improvement net loss    improvement current ratio improvement despite a decrease in revenues discussed below we have been able to achieve a decrease in our net loss for the period 
this has been largely achieved through greater management focus  the outsourcing of non core businesses and more efficient research and procurement programs 
we have also shown a continuous improvement in our current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities 
at december  our current ratio exceeds  a result achieved by tighter management of our net working capital

our product sales revenues of  for the year ended december  comprised  from the sale of named patient products   from the sale of monoclonal antibodies  and  from the sale of skincare products 
in may  exclusive rights for the worldwide distribution of mill creek r and silver fox r products were granted to united states international trading corporation usitc 
in return for the grant of the distribution rights  ccsi received a  license fee and will receive guaranteed minimum quarterly royalties based on net sales from september ccsi also sold its trading inventories to usitc 
on december   we entered into a license and supply agreement with omp inc for the exclusive marketing and distribution of kinetin products in the mass marketing channel of distribution in a number of major asian countries 
also  omp inc receives exclusivity for kinetin in the multi level marketing channel of distribution in taiwan 
for the grant of the distribution rights the agreement calls for senetek to receive  license fees 
of this  we received  in and  in we have recorded these fees as deferred income and will recognize revenue under the terms of the agreement 
on june   we entered into a license and royalty agreement with revlon inc  for kinetin in the mass market  excluding certain asian countries 
in exchange for these rights we received a non refundable license fee of  we have recorded these fees as deferred income and will recognize revenue under the terms of the agreement 
the overall sales decrease of for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was represented by a decrease in skincare sales of and a decrease in pharmaceutical sales  comprising named patient sales and monoclonal antibodies sales of 
the decrease in pharmaceutical sales was due to a decrease in sales volume 
the sales of monoclonal antibodies  some of which are used for the early diagnosis of alzeimers disease  follow sales patterns determined by project driven research organizations and are subject to fluctuation 
the decrease in sales of skincare products was mainly due to decreased sales of products to icn pharmaceuticals inc icn has been reducing its inventory position throughout but has been maintaining its sales to third party customers 
we have also experienced a decrease in direct sales of mill creek products which have been replaced with quarterly royalties under the usitc licensing agreement 
partially offsetting these decreases are skincare sales to omp which commenced in the first half of our sales revenues of  for comprised  from the sale of named patient products   from the sales of monoclonal antibodies and  from the sale of skincare products 
the overall sales increase of for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was represented by an increase of skincare sales of and a decrease in pharmaceutical sales  comprising named patient sales and monoclonal antibodies sales of the decrease in sales of pharmaceutical sales was mainly due to decreased sales volumes in sales of monoclonal antibodies  some of which are used for the early diagnosis of alzeimers disease  follow sales patterns determined by project driven research organizations and are subject to fluctuation 
the increase in sales of skincare products was mainly due to sales of product to icn pharmaceuticals inc under a licensing and supply agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of the strong sales to icn in resulted in them having high inventory levels at december  which they have been reducing in this inventory reduction has resulted in a one time decrease in sales to icn in cost of sales cost of goods sold for the year ended december   which includes contract manufacturing and material costs  was  down from the year ended december  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was for the year ended december  compared to for year ended december  the cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increase is due to start up contract manufacturing costs for additional skincare supply arrangements which include quality and assurance testing and process validation and a change in the method of calculating royalties on the sale of monoclonal antibodies to our licensor and the payment of a management fee to a new distributor 
in addition  cost of goods sold was increased by  as a result of an increase of the inventory reserve on various products of non core businesses being outsourced 
the gross profit percentage of for would have been had the inventory reserve not been increased 
in the pharmaceutical sector  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  up from  from the year ended december  despite a decrease of  in sales volume from this is due mainly to a change in the method of determining royalties on the sale of monoclonal antibodies to our licensor and the payment of a management fee to a new distributor 
offsetting this was a decrease in named patient sales resulting from an interruption of invicorp supply during repositioning of the product in a more cost efficient drug delivery device 
in the skincare sector  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  a decrease of from  for the year ended december  this is mainly due to a decrease in net sales that include a reduction in sales volumes as a result of decreased sales to icn and the out licensing of the mill creek and silver fox lines for which the company receives royalties in lieu of direct sales revenues 
research and development pharmaceutical division research and development expenses in the year ended december  were  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared with was primarily due to a reduction in expenditures resulting from improved efficiencies in our r d programs and decreased spending for the development of invicorp and adrenaject as both projects near final stages of development 
we have also recognized five months of savings arising from the closure of our st louis research and development operations in august in august senetek announced that it had received word from the medicines control agency of the united kingdom and the federal food and drug administration of the us that a competitor s safety trial on phentolamine mesylate revealed preclinical tumors proliferation of brown fat cells 
the committee on safety of medicines in the uk met at the end of july to review the phentolamine situation 
we received a letter dated august  from the medicines control agency confirming that the committee on the safety of medicines had advised the medicines control agency that the development of hibernomas in rat carcinogenicity studies with phentolamine mesylate does not represent a significant carcinogenic risk to humans 
the medicines control agency went on to say that as there is no longer a safety concern with invicorp  it has lifted the clinical hold on invicorp 
in october the medicines control agency granted senetek a marketing authorization approval for invicorp in the united kingdom 
in june the medicines assessment advisory committee granted senetek a marketing authorization approval for invicorp in new zealand 
in july the danish medicines agency granted senetek a marketing authorization approval for invicorp in denmark 
however  we expect future research and development spending for erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction to increase significantly as we progress the mutual recognition procedure in europe  prepare for invicorp clinical trials in the us and start development work on the topical peptide program with tel aviv university and the weizmann institute of science in israel 
pharmaceutical sector research and development accounted for of our total research and development spending for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease of  in compared with was primarily due to substantially reduced levels of phase clinical trials for invicorp tm as these reach completion in europe 
reduction of excess and overlapping staff now covered by a more efficient and effective fee for service program 
one time purchase of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and phentolamine mesylate for  in reduced spending levels on reliaject tm and invicorp tm in the fourth quarter of as we developed a new drug delivery strategy for invicorp tm utilizing a cost effective  state of the art delivery system 
reduced levels of external consultancy in the area of regulatory affairs 
skincare division research and development expenses in the year ended december  were  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the increase of  in compared with has no significance as we continued with formulation development on our kinetin products in at similar levels compared to the increase of  in compared with is mainly due to additional formulation work undertaken on our kinetin plus products 
our current strategy is to utilize our partners research and development resources for the further development of kinetin  kinetin plus and zeatin products 
general and administrative pharmaceutical division general and administrative expenses totaled  for  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared to was primarily due to a change in accounting principle regarding stock compensation expense for non executive directors who are elected by shareholders at the annual general meeting 
this was offset by increased legal expenses in connection with the osmotics litigation  the negotiation of additional commercial agreements and the development of a rigorous patent and trademark strategy to protect our key intellectual property 
also  a one time credit of  was recorded in the third quarter of for the cancellation of unvested stock compensation accruals relating to prior management 
the decrease of  in compared to was primarily due to net savings arising from the corporate consolidation and cost reduction program 
the main results of the program were the substantial reduction of our headcount and the consolidation of offices mentioned below 
we incurred one time costs in our corporate restructuring program  which was launched at the beginning of in may we closed our uk  london operations and combined those functions in our uk kettering office 
we also pared down our uk clinical monitoring and development staff and have substantially moved these functions to our napa office 
the reduction in headcount was people and the severance packages of  which included full settlement with a former director  were expensed in the second quarter of also  during the third quarter of we closed our st louis research facility and transferred their functions to napa 
there were no significant one time costs incurred  arising from the closure of the st 
louis facility 
the financial impact of the st 
louis closure are annualized savings of approximately  in salaries and office overheads 
furthermore  we settled our legal disputes with a former director and consultant and recognized the settlement costs of  in the second quarter of also  in the third quarter we executed release and separation agreements with our former chairman and ceo and our former president and coo both of whom left our employment towards the end of the fourth quarter in the case of the chairman and ceo there were no settlement costs and million stock options were cancelled 
in the case of the president and coo we settled outstanding expenses of  and cancelled  stock options 
we also incurred in the second quarter of expenses of  relating to the write off of expense advances for former employees 
legal costs of  relating primarily to the settlements of disputes arising from commitments made by former management to lenders  together with disputes with former employees and consultants and  to a lesser extent  the april financing arrangements  were incurred in the second  third and fourth quarters of in we recognized a charge to stock compensation expense of  as compared to  in the expense is reconciled as follows stock compensation expense  for employee based stock option plans in accordance with accounting principle board opinion no 
apb and  for non employee based stock option plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no fas and reversal of previously recorded stock compensation expense on the cancellation of non vested options of  offsetting the net savings mentioned above were provisions for doubtful accounts receivable of  skincare division general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared to was mainly due to a reduction in costs arising from the licensing of our skincare product lines and the establishment of substantial bad debt provisions amounting to  during the fourth quarter of the increase of  in compared to was mainly due to costs incurred in relation to the new license and supply arrangements and provision for bad debts 
marketing and promotion pharmaceutical division we incurred no marketing and promotion expenses for  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the  decrease in compared to is due to the elimination of non essential marketing expenditures 
the  decrease in compared to is mainly due to the elimination of external consulting arrangements and non essential advertising expenditure 
skincare division we incurred no marketing and promotion expenses for  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared to is due to the elimination of marketing expenditures as all the skincare product lines were under third party licensing arrangements 
the decrease of  in compared to was mainly due to the implementation of a focused marketing plan  which resulted in all the skincare product lines coming under third party licensing arrangements 
selling expenses skincare division we incurred no selling expenses in and compared with  in no field selling expenses have been recorded during and this is due to the establishment of licensing and distribution arrangements in the skincare sector and the elimination of direct selling activities 
impairment costs in december  the company abandoned certain fixed assets 
as a result of this abandonment  the company recorded an impairment loss of  the assets written down comprised of assets in progress associated with the reliaject development and computers and office equipment 
the pharmaceutical and skincare business segments were written down by  and  respectively 
other income and expense in april  the company received  net of  in expenses in cash and refinanced the balance owed of  under a credit agreement  in exchange for two new notes that currently bear interest at per annum and mature in april the notes require semi annual payment of interest only until maturity and are secured by all of the company s assets 
interest may be paid in cash or in ordinary shares that have been registered with the sec 
the company issued series a warrants to purchase an aggregate of  ordinary shares at per share  which were adjusted down to in accordance with certain terms of the agreement under which they were issued 
the series a warrants expire five years from the date of issuance 
series b and c warrants to purchase approximately million and million ordinary shares at and per share were issued in connection with the company s settlement and refinancing agreements are only exercisable to the extent the outstanding principal balance of  is not repaid in cash 
the series b and c warrants expire ten years from the date of issuance 
the fair value of  of the series a warrants and all of the series b warrants was determined to be million using the black scholes model 
the fair value of these warrants will be amortized over the life of the new notes because such warrants  under the terms of the financing agreement  were issued in connection with the million new financing 
on the other hand  the million fair value of the remaining  series a warrants and all of the series c warrants was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt discussed below because these warrants were issued to refinance existing debt under the terms of the april financing agreement 
the amortization of the deferred finance costs on the million new financing amounted to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  as the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement were refinanced by notes with substantially different terms as defined by eitf  debtors accounting for a modification or extinguishment of debt instruments  eitf  the company is required to recognize the difference between the fair value of the new notes issued to refinance the old debt and the carrying value of the old debt net of unamortized issuance costs as a loss on the extinguishment of debt 
during  the company recognized a  loss on the extinguishment of debt 
also  in april the company entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the terms of various transactions that had been entered into by the previous management of the company 
the settlement terms required the issuance of  series a warrants and  new ordinary shares 
accordingly the company recorded  of expense in the second quarter of related to the settlement terms 
included in the  settlement expense is the fair value of the  ordinary shares issued in also  included in other expense for the year ended december  is  of external interest expense on the notes payable of  compared with  for the year ended december  change in accounting principle in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the application of opinion no 
for a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
in accordance with fin  which became effective july  we have changed our accounting principles for the recognition of stock compensation expense for our non executive directors all of whom retire by rotation and can stand for re election at the company s shareholder annual general meeting 
we have  included our non executive directors within the scope of apb and have reported the cumulative effect of changing to this new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
this change in accounting principle has decreased the net loss in by  taxation refer to note to the financial statements for discussion of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased by  during to  this decrease is due to the excess of our operational losses  capital expenditure and net movements in working capital over the receipt of license fees from revlon and omp and proceeds arising from the exercise of stock options 
despite the significant payment of past due liabilities and contractual commitments in associated with decisions of past management  we have increased our current ratio to  a substantial improvement since we may continue  as in the past  to rely on additional sources of private financing through equity financing  short term loans or proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants to fund operations 
our independent auditors report on our consolidated financial statements included in item states that senetek 
has suffered recurring losses from its pharmaceutical operations and its ability to continue research activities to a stage where it has a product available for sale is dependent upon securing additional sources of financing and achieving profitability 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about 
senetek s 
ability to continue as a going concern 
however  management is encouraged by the performance of the company over the past two years and is budgeting for continued improvement 
discussions in connection with new licensing agreements  new skincare markets and erectile dysfunction markets combined with reduced and more efficient spending may yield better financial results 
management expects better financial performance to fund our increased research and development budget for which is estimated at million 
however  we may also continue to rely on additional sources of private financing through equity financing  short term loans or proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants 
a substantial decrease in our operating and net losses and a marked improvement in our current ratio were the major financial highlights in in thousands operating loss    improvement net loss    improvement current ratio improvement despite a decrease in revenues discussed below we have been able to achieve a decrease in our net loss for the period 
this has been largely achieved through greater management focus  the outsourcing of non core businesses and more efficient research and procurement programs 
in april  we issued  in aggregate principal amount of secured promissory notes 
the notes currently bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually  and are due and payable in full in april the repayment of the notes is secured by all of the assets of senetek plc and its subsidiaries 
in exchange for the issuance of the notes  we received  in cash less expenses and refinancing of  of our previously outstanding debt 
we also issued warrants to purchase ordinary shares in connection with the issuance of the notes 
although we have received no commitment for the advance of any further funds  other lenders who advance up to an additional  may share in the collateral securing the notes described above on pari passu basis with the existing note holders 
our other most significant expenditure commitments are our research agreements  consulting agreements  employment agreements and property leases 
we anticipate spending approximately million during on the development of our pharmaceutical and skincare products  including our auto injector projects  and on our administrative and marketing operations 
our management is of the opinion that although we will generate increased revenues from the licensing of our skincare product lines  monoclonal antibodies and the invicorp tm product to customers in countries where we have existing marketing authorization approvals these may not be sufficient to meet our short term financial requirements 
our management is discussing the possibility of entering into licensing arrangements with several major pharmaceutical companies 
although these discussions may lead to a license agreement of a substantial nature in due course  we cannot assure that we will be successful in securing such an agreement 
additionally  certain holders of a substantial number of warrants may exercise their right to convert their warrants into shares upon payment to us of the exercise price as the conversion dates approach 
government policy it is the opinion of our board of directors that there are no aspects of government policy which  as far as can be foreseen  are likely to have a material effect on the conduct of our business  except as generally described in part i  item  of this form k under the heading government regulation 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had any material effect on the results of our operations to date 
year we have not experienced any hardware or software problems related to the millennium date change 
we do not anticipate any significant latent software or hardware problems  but we have retained the company that performed our testing and evaluation on an annual maintenance contract 
foreign currencies we have operations in the united kingdom  where the functional currency is the pound sterling 
the company follows currency translation principles established by sfas no 
all assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of the uk operation are translated at period end exchange rates 
all income and expenditure items in the profit and loss account of the uk operation are translated at average monthly exchange rates 
translation gains and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of the uk operation are not included in determining net income but are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income in the period in which they occur 
we do not use any methods to hedge the effect of changes in the pound sterling exchange rate 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
sfas no 
 revised employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
it did not change the measurement of recognition of those plans  and  accordingly  had no effect on results of operations and financial position upon adoption by the company as of october  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as hedge  the object of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of i the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk  or ii the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which amends sfas to be effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which addressed certain implementation issues of sfas historically  we have not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  adoption of this new standard has no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in december  the sec staff released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements 
the guidance in sab  as amended by sab b  is required to be followed starting with the fourth quarter of we do not believe that the guidance contained in sab will have a material affect on our financial results 
certain factors that may affect future operating results if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated  we may be unable to continue our operations 
although we began operating almost years ago in october  our business is subject to the risks inherent in the establishment of a relatively new business enterprise in the field of biopharmaceuticals 
you should consider likelihood of the success of our business in light of the problems  expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of new products and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate 
since inception  we have produced  in gross revenues and have had cumulative losses of  including net losses of  for the year ended december  
as a result of these losses  our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their report on the december  financial statements that these losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
although we may market certain of our biopharmaceutical products in the second half of  we cannot assure you that we will begin marketing those products when we expect to  if at all  or that revenues from our other products  including kinetin  will rise to a level that will allow us to operate profitably during the fiscal year ending december  our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter  which makes it difficult to predict our future performance 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  our earnings will decline if revenue declines in a given quarter 
this could be due to delays in recognizing revenue or for other reasons 
in particular  research and development and general and administrative expenses are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
due to fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
in future quarter or quarters  our operating results could will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that case  our stock price could fluctuate significantly or decline 
if we are unable to obtain further funding  our ability to operate could suffer 
in the event that we are unable to obtain further funding  or the costs of development and operations prove greater than anticipated  we may be required to further curtail our operations or seek alternative financing arrangements 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if we have insufficient funds or are unable to raise additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce or cease certain of our programs 
this would materially and adversely affect our business 
our auditors have included an uncertainty paragraph in their opinion on our financial statements suggesting that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we cannot develop commercially successful products  we will not be able to generate significant revenues 
our product launches to date have generated limited revenues 
we have product candidates in various stages of development and will undertake substantial additional research and development and preclinical and clinical testing of our products 
these efforts may not result in the development of any commercially successful products 
some of our potential products are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new biopharmaceutical products including the risks that 
a product candidate fails in preclinical studies  
a potential product is not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  
we fail to obtain regulatory approval for the product  
we fail to produce a product in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost  and 
a product does not gain market acceptance 
future financings may result in the substantial dilution of stockholders interests and may result in future investors being granted rights superior to those of existing stockholders 
continued research and development efforts are required or our products may be rendered obsolete by other technological developments 
our field is characterized by extensive research efforts 
our research could prove unproductive 
furthermore  other companies could engage in research or development which renders our programs superfluous or obsolete 
this is true for all companies who operate in the same field 
competition in our industry is intense  and an inability to compete successfully may harm our business 
the biomedical  drug delivery  biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive 
our business and research efforts compete with drug discovery programs at biotechnology  drug delivery  biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies  as well as with internal drug discovery efforts of pharmaceutical companies acting independently or in collaboration with other companies 
in addition  academic institutions  government agencies throughout the world and public and private organizations conducting research may seek intellectual property protection  discover competing products  or establish collaborative arrangements in our area of research and development 
we face exposure to liability for our products 
during recent years  lawsuits resulting in very substantial liability have been filed against companies engaged in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and other medical related products or devices which have subsequently proved harmful to human health 
many of these cases have exposed companies to liability long after the products have been brought to market even though  at the time of their development  based on extensive research  there were no perceived risks of injury 
thus  notwithstanding united states food and drug administration fda or other foreign governmental approval  we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to liability from the use of our products  or that our product liability coverage will be adequate to protect against future claims 
management intends to have third parties manufacture and distribute certain of our products in order to lessen our liability 
however  we cannot assure you that this result will be achieved 
we rely on certain key suppliers in order to produce our products 
we manufacture all of our products through third party contractors and purchase raw materials from third party suppliers 
we recently established a dual supply chain for kinetin 
although we believe that other suppliers are available who can produce similar materials and products  we cannot assure you that such materials would be available to us on an immediate basis if needed  or at prices similar to those now paid by us 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology  which could impair our ability to compete in the market 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products  both in the united states and in other countries 
our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
we rely on our issued and pending patent applications in the united states and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
we cannot assure you that any of the currently pending or future patent applications will issue as patents  or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
further  we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information or that adequate remedies would exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
the exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
further  we cannot assure you that others have not or will not independently develop substantially equivalent know how and technology 
our commercial success also depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents or proprietary rights and the breach of any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of several third party patents that may relate to our technology 
we believe that we do not infringe these patents but cannot assure you that we will not be found in the future to infringe these or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties  either with products we are currently developing or with new products that we may seek to develop in the future 
if third parties assert infringement claims against us  we may be forced to enter into license arrangements with them 
we cannot assure you that we could enter into the required licenses on commercially reasonably terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or to implement alternative approaches may prevent us from commercializing products under development and would impair our ability to be commercially competitive 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions 
the cost of enforcing our proprietary rights may be expensive and result in increased losses 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  us patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings will result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
further  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised during the discovery process of any litigation 
during the course of any lawsuit  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
regulation by government agencies imposes significant costs and restrictions on our business activities 
the production and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated 
our ability and the ability of our partners to secure regulatory approval for our products and to continue to satisfy regulatory requirements will determine our future success 
we may not receive required regulatory approvals for our products or receive approvals in a timely manner 
in particular  fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries  including the european medicines evaluation agency and the medicines control agency mca in the uk  must approve human therapeutic and preventive products before they are marketed 
this approval process can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
while the time required to obtain approval varies  it can take several years 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of products and our ability to receive product revenues or royalties 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the necessary approvals for clinical testing or for the manufacturing and marketing of any products that we develop 
we are also subject to ongoing regulatory review 
discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility or other violations of regulatory requirements may result in 
fines  
suspensions of regulatory approvals  
product recalls  and 
criminal prosecution the failure to obtain regulatory approvals  the restriction  suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements or changes in the regulatory framework could materially and adversely affect our business 
professional guidelines could adversely affect our business 
private health organizations and science foundations may publish recommendations for treatments  which affect various therapies  drugs or procedures  including any products we might develop 
these recommendations may relate to 
usage  
dosage  
method of administration  and 
use of other therapies simultaneously 
if patients and health care providers follow recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use of our products  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the price of our adss is volatile 
the market price of our adss  like that of other biotechnology companies  has fluctuated significantly 
factors that could cause our stock price to fluctuate in the future may include 
announcements by us or our competitors of clinical trial results and other product developments  
adverse developments in the protection of intellectual property or other legal matters  
announcements in the scientific and research community or by other biotechnology companies  
regulatory changes that affect our products  
fluctuations in our operating results  and 
changes in third party reimbursement policies or in medical practices 
third party reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives may constrain our future revenues 
our ability to successfully market any product we develop  and particularly with respect to our invicorp product candidate  will depend in part on the level of reimbursement that government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations provide for the cost of our products and related treatments 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope 
third party payors may not reimburse patients for newly approved health care products such as those that we are developing 
increasingly  third party payors are attempting to contain health care costs in ways that are likely to impact our development of products including 
challenging the prices charged for health care products  
limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products  
denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered experimental or investigational by third party payors  and 
refusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used in a way that has not received regulatory marketing approval 
united states judgments may not be enforceable against us 
judgments of united states courts  including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states  may not be enforceable against us in english courts 
as a result  stockholders who obtain a judgment against us in the united states may not be able to require us to pay the amount of the judgment 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  variability in interest rate spread relationships ie  prime to libor spreads and exchange rate variability 
we believe that fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows as we have limited risks related to interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations
