results of operations profit from world fuel s aviation fuel services business is directly related to the volume and the gross profit achieved on sales  as well as the overall level of operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that world fuel is required to provision for potential bad debts 
profit from world fuel s marine fuel services business is determined primarily by the volume and commission rate of brokering business generated and by the volume and gross profit achieved on trade sales  as well as the overall level of operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that world fuel is required to provision for potential bad debts 
in april  world fuel acquired the operations of the bunkerfuels group of companies

the increase in fuel prices has to date  and will continue to adversely affect world fuel s customers 
world fuel s profitability during the comparable fiscal versus fiscal was favored by an improvement in the gross profit per gallon in aviation  and metric ton in marine  as well as a lower provision for bad debts 
during the same comparable periods  earnings were affected by a decline in overall volume principally in aviation  and the severance expense related to the termination of the employment agreement with world fuel s former chairman of the board 
the decline in aviation volume reflects consolidation within the aviation industry  as well as management s decision to refine its credit practices

liquidity and capital resources in world fuel s aviation and marine fuel businesses  the primary use of working capital is to finance receivables

page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk world fuel conducts the vast majority of its business transactions in us dollars 
however  in certain markets  primarily in mexico  payments to its aviation fuel supplier are denominated in local currency 
this subjects world fuel to foreign currency exchange risk  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
world fuel seeks to minimize the risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations through its regular operating and financing activities 
world fuel s borrowings pursuant to its credit facility provides for various market driven variable interest rate options 
these interest rates are subject to interest rate changes in the united states and the eurodollar market 
world fuel does not currently use  nor has it historically used  derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce interest rate risk 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
to take advantage of favorable market conditions or for competitive reasons  world fuel enters into short term cancelable fuel purchase commitments for the physical delivery of product in the united states 
world fuel simultaneously may hedge the physical delivery through a commodity based derivative instrument  to minimize the effects of commodity price fluctuations 
world fuel offers swaps and caps to customers in the marine business as part of its fuel management services 
world fuel simultaneously enters into a commodity based derivative instrument with its customer and a counterparty 
the counterparties are major oil companies and derivative trading firms 
accordingly  world fuel does not anticipate non performance by such conterparties 
pursuant to these transactions  world fuel is not affected by market price fluctuations since the contracts have the same terms and conditions except for the fee or spread earned by world fuel 
performance risk under these contracts is considered a credit risk 
this risk is minimized by dealing with customers meeting additional credit criteria 
as of march   world fuel had one outstanding swap contract for  metric tons expiring on december world fuel s policy is to not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
