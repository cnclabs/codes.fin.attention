management currently anticipates that the net cash requirements of its discontinued operations will be approximately million in however  because the requirements of the company s discontinued operations are largely a function of contingencies  it is possible that the actual net cash requirements of the company s discontinued operations could differ materially from management s estimates

tax matters at december   the company had outstanding net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
substantially all of these nols expire over the period from to the company also has unused federal tax credits of approximately million  of which million expire during the period to as a result of the heartland transaction  heartland will own approximately percent of the outstanding shares 
this constitutes a change in control that results in annual limitations on the company s use of its nols and unused tax credits 
this annual limitation on the use of nols and tax credits depends on the value of the equity of the company and the amount of built in gain or built in loss in the company s assets at the date of the change in control 
based on the expiration dates of the nols and tax credits as well as anticipated levels of domestic income  management does not believe that the transaction will have a material impact on these deferred tax assets 
management has reviewed the company s operating results for recent years as well as the outlook for its continuing operations and concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized 
the company announced a reorganization on february  see note to the consolidated financial statements to better align itself in the marketplace 
a major goal of this reorganization is to lower the overall cost structure of the company and thereby increase profitability 
the infusion of cash from the heartland transaction is expected to lower the overall debt of the company and reduce its interest expense 
these factors  along with the timing of the reversal of its temporary differences  certain tax planning strategies and the expiration date of its nols were also considered in reaching this conclusion 
the company s ability to generate future taxable income is dependent on numerous factors  including general economic conditions  the state of the automotive industry and other factors beyond management s control 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectation of future taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  provides for certain deferred tax assets that in management s assessment may not be realized due to tax limitations on the use of such amounts or that relate to tax attributes that are subject to uncertainty due to the long term nature of their realization 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that i affect ongoing operations and may increase capital costs and operating expenses and ii impose liability for the costs of investigation and remediation and otherwise relate to on site and off site contamination 
the company s management believes that it has obtained  and is in material compliance with  all material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct its various businesses 
environmental compliance costs for continuing businesses currently are accounted for as normal operating expenses or capital expenditures of such business units 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  such environmental compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
the company is legally or contractually responsible or alleged to be responsible for the investigation and remediation of contamination at various sites 
it also has received notices that it is a prp in a number of proceedings 
the company may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  including with respect to divested and acquired businesses 
the company is currently engaged in investigation or remediation at certain sites 
in estimating the total cost of investigation and remediation  the company has considered  among other things  the company s prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  remediation efforts by other parties  data released by the united states environmental protection agency  the professional judgment of the company s environmental experts  outside environmental specialists and other experts  and the likelihood that other parties which have been named as prps will have the financial resources to fulfill their obligations at sites where they and the company may be jointly and severally liable 
under the theory of joint and several liability  the company could be liable for the full costs of investigation and remediation even if additional parties are found to be responsible under the applicable laws 
it is difficult to estimate the total cost of investigation and remediation due to various factors including incomplete information regarding particular sites and other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of environmental problems and the company s share  if any  of liability for such problems  the selection of alternative compliance approaches  the complexity of environmental laws and regulations and changes in cleanup standards and techniques 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   excluding sites at which the company s participation is anticipated to be de minimis or otherwise insignificant or where the company is being indemnified by a third party for the liability  there are sites where the company is participating in the investigation or remediation of the site  either directly or through financial contribution  and additional sites where the company is alleged to be responsible for costs of investigation or remediation 
as of december   the company s estimate of its liability for these sites  is approximately million 
as of december   the company has established reserves of approximately million for the estimated future costs related to all its known environmental sites 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  the environmental costs and contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company has identified or properly assessed all potential environmental liability arising from the activities or properties of the company  its present and former subsidiaries and their corporate predecessors 
during  the company settled claims for certain environmental matters related to discontinued operations for a total of million 
settlement proceeds will be paid to the company in three installments 
the first installment of million was received on june   with the second and third installments of million and million to be received in june and june  respectively 
of the total million settlement  the company recorded the present value of the settlement as million of additional environmental reserves  based on its assessment of potential environmental exposures  and million  net of income taxes  as income from discontinued operations

to mitigate the risk from these interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company enters into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to policies and procedures 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate exposure the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s long term debt obligations 
the interest rate exposure for the company s variable rate debt obligations is currently indexed to libor  for us denominated debt  or the canadian bankers acceptance rate  for canadian denominated debt  of one  two  three or six months  as selected by the company 
while the company has used interest rate swaps and other interest rate protection agreements to modify its exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing rates  no such agreements were in place at december  the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the company s debt obligations 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on implied libor and canadian bankers acceptance forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
the instrument s actual cash flows are denominated in both us dollar us and canadian dollar cad  as indicated in parentheses dollar amounts in thousands

the primary purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with these foreign currency exposures 
the company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options with durations of generally less than months 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common currency on that date 
the conversion did not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

for additional information on hedging activity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the information presented does not fully reflect the net foreign exchange rate exposure of the company because it does not include the intercompany funding arrangements denominated in foreign currencies and the foreign currency denominated cash flows from anticipated sales and purchases 
management believes that the foreign currency exposure relating to these items would substantially offset the exposure discussed above
