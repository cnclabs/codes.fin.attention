impact of new accounting standards existing generally accepted accounting principles do not provide specific guidance on the accounting for sales incentives that many companies offer to their customers 
the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force has issued eitf  which addresses the recognition  measurement and income statement classification for certain sales incentives offered by companies in the form of discounts  coupons or rebates 
the implementation of this new accounting pronouncement will require penn traffic to make certain reclassifications between revenues and costs and operating expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
penn traffic currently expects to implement eitf in the second quarter of fiscal in accordance with such implementation  penn traffic will also reclassify certain prior period financial statements for comparability purposes 
penn traffic expects that the implementation of eitf will result in an equal decrease to the company s reported revenues and costs and operating expenses 
accordingly  penn traffic is currently reviewing this pronouncement with its auditors and therefore cannot quantify the precise effect on reported revenues  costs and operating expenses or same store sales results 
the company believes that the implementation of eitf will not have an effect on penn traffic s reported operating income  ebitda or net income loss 
the company currently estimates that had eitf been implemented in fiscal  same store sales for fiscal would have been reduced by no more than of sales from that reported under the company s existing income statement classifications due  in part  to the increased promotional allowance opportunities which the company s vendors have made available to the company in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
penn traffic will adopt the statement of financial accounting standards no
