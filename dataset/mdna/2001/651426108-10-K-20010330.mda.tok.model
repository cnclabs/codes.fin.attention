inflation  risks and related factors affecting forward looking information except for historical matters  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have tried  wherever practical  to identify these forward looking statements by using words like anticipate  believe  estimate  project  expect  and similar expressions 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about plans  opportunities  negotiations  market and economic conditions  development  construction  and sales activities  and availability of financing 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our current beliefs and are based on information currently available to us 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect future events or changes in circumstances 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to differ from those expressed in or implied by these statements 
in particular  among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are sales of real estate the majority of the company s revenues is generated by its real estate operations 
the ability of the company to consummate sales of real estate is dependent on various factors including  but not limited to  availability of financing to the buyer  agreement with buyers on definitive terms regulatory and legal issues and successful completion of the buyer s due diligence 
the fact that a real estate transaction has entered escrow does not necessarily mean that the transaction ultimately will close 
therefore  the timing of sales may differ from that anticipated by the company 
the inability to close sales as anticipated could adversely impact the recognition of revenue in any specific period 
economic conditions real estate development is significantly impacted by general and local economic conditions which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s real estate operations are concentrated in southern california 
the regional economy is profoundly affected by the entertainment  technology  defense and certain other segments 
consequently  all sectors of real estate development for the company tend to be cyclical 
while the economy of southern california continues to be strong  there can be no assurances that present trends will continue 
inflation the company believes it is well positioned against the effects of inflation 
historically  during periods of inflation  the company has been able to increase selling prices of properties to offset rising costs of land development and construction 
recently  land values have been increasing at a faster rate than costs 
however  there are no assurances that this trend will continue 
a portion of the commercial income portfolio is protected from inflation since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in the company s leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation  while the underlying value of commercial properties has tended to rise over the long term 
interest rates and financing fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of financing have an important impact on the company s performance 
sales of the company s properties could be adversely impacted by the inability of buyers to obtain adequate financing 
further  the company s real estate development activities are dependent on the availability of adequate sources of capital 
certain of the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and would be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates 
competition the sale and leasing of residential  industrial and commercial real estate is highly competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources 
the degree of competition is affected by such factors as the supply of real estate available which is comparable to that sold and leased by the company and the level of demand for such real estate 
valencia experienced a slight decrease in its new home sale market share at both the local and the county level in  due to the temporary decline in new home inventory 
there is no assurance that this new home sales decline will reverse in the future even with an increasing supply of new homes in valencia given competing projects in the region 
this could impact the company s ability to sell residential land 
geographic concentration the company s real estate development activities are focused on the  acres that it owns in los angeles county 
the company s entire commercial income portfolio is located in the valencia area 
therefore  any factors affecting that concentrated area  such as changes in the housing market  economic conditions and environmental factors  which cannot be predicted with certainty  could affect future results 
exposure to natural occurrences the company s real estate development and sales activities may be affected by natural occurrences such as earthquakes and weather conditions that may impact progress of infrastructure construction and land development  and the pace of sales 
government regulation and entitlement risks in developing its projects  the company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities regulating such matters as permitted land uses  density and traffic  and the provision of utility services such as electricity  water and waste disposal 
in addition  the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
this government regulation affects the types of projects which can be pursued by the company and increases the cost of development and ownership 
the company devotes substantial financial and managerial resources to comply with these requirements 
to varying degrees  certain permits and approvals will be required to complete the developments currently being undertaken or planned by the company 
furthermore  the timing  cost and scope of planned projects may be subject to legal challenges  particularly large projects with regional impacts 
see following litigation discussion 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application 
the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits for its projects can be beyond the company s control and could restrict or prevent development of otherwise desirable new properties 
the company s results of operations in any period will be affected by the amount of entitled properties the company has in inventory 
litigation the land use approval processes the company must follow to ultimately develop its projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of  and actual  third party challenges to planned real estate developments have provided additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation will  by its nature  adversely affect the length of time required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation increase the costs and may adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company utilizes both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at december   the company had million of variable debt with an average interest rate of and million of fixed rate debt with interest rates ranging from to 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of the company s long term fixed rate and variable rate debt at december  by expected maturity dates dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value mortgage and other debt fixed rate debt      weighted average interest rate variable rate debt   weighted average interest rate the company has a million revolving mortgage facility  which bears interest at libor plus against which million was outstanding at december  the company also has unsecured lines of credit consisting of a million line and a million line on which the interest rate is libor plus against which no borrowings were outstanding at december  and a million line on which the rate is libor plus against which million was outstanding at december  the amounts set forth in the table above assume that the outstanding amounts under the variable rate credit facilities will be repaid at the facilities respective maturity dates 
management believes that these lines will be renewed at maturity with similar terms 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt in order to maintain variable rate exposure at an acceptable level and by taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt 
in addition  the company s guideline for total debt is not to exceed of the appraised value of the income portfolio
