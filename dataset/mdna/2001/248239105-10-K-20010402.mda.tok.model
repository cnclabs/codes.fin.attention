overview in  dendrite was the successor to a business co founded in by john e 
bailye  the company s chairman and chief executive officer 
the business was established to provide sales force effectiveness or sfe solutions  which have evolved into what is commonly referred to as crm solutions  that enable companies to manage  coordinate and control the activities of large sales forces in complex selling environments  primarily in the prescription only pharmaceutical industry 
today  our crm solutions combine software products with a wide range of specialized support services 
these services include software implementation  technical and hardware support and sales force support 
we develop  implement and service sales force software products through our own sales  support and technical personnel located in offices worldwide 
the company generates revenues from both services and licenses 
service revenues  which account for a substantial majority of our revenues  consist of fees from a wide variety of contracted services which we make available to our customers  generally under multi year contracts 
we generate implementation fees from services provided to configure and implement the crm software products for our customers 
we receive technical and hardware support fees for services related to  among other things  ongoing technical support  maintenance of our customers databases  operations of our customers server computers  maintenance for our customers remote hardware and asset control 
technical and hardware support fees also include fees for software maintenance services such as software defect resolution and performance enhancements 
we generally charge fees for these maintenance services based on a percentage of total license fees 
we receive sales force support fees for organizing and managing support of our customers sales force  including training  telephone support and data analysis services 
it is our experience that our larger customers increase the amount of services they purchase from us over time 
fees for these additional services are typically based on the labor and materials used to provide the applicable service 
we charge our customers license fees to use our proprietary computer software 
customers generally pay one time perpetual license fees based upon the number of users  the territory covered and the particular software licensed by the customer 
the company generally recognizes license fees as revenue using the percentage of completion method over a period of time that commences with the execution of the license agreement and ends when the product configuration is complete and it is ready for use in the field 
this period of time usually includes initial customization or configuration and concludes with quality assurance and testing 
when there is no initial customization or configuration  the company generally recognizes the license fees from those products upon delivery if any services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software 
additionally  license revenues are recognized immediately when the user count for previously delivered software increases 
historically  the company s software licensing agreements provide for a warranty period typically days from the date of execution of the agreement 
the company s software maintenance period usually begins immediately after the warranty period 
the portion of the license fee associated with the warranty period is unbundled from the license fee and is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
the company does not recognize any license fees unless persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license amount is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable

net cash provided by operating activities was  for  compared to  for this decrease was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable at december  the increase in accounts receivable was due to an increase in revenues and a delay in payments relating to certain accounts receivable balances  which were expected by december   but were not received until this decrease was partially offset by increased net income during as compared to cash used in investing activities was  for as compared to  in this decrease was due primarily to increased sales of short term investments  partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
we obtained  of cash from financing activities in as compared to  in this increase was due primarily to an increase in the issuance of common stock  which resulted from the exercise of employee stock options during the year  as well as lower payments on capital lease obligations 
we maintain a million revolving line of credit agreement with the chase manhattan bank  na the agreement is available to finance working capital needs and possible future acquisitions 
the terms of this agreement require us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth  among other covenants  measured quarterly  which is equal to our net worth as of december   plus of our net income earned after january  and of the net proceeds to us of any stock offerings as defined in the agreement 
this covenant effectively limits the amount of cash dividends we may pay 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement and we satisfied all of our covenant obligations 
our working capital was approximately  at december  and  at december  we believe that available funds  anticipated cash flows from operations and our line of credit will satisfy our currently projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of cash required for possible acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  for the foreseeable future 
the company is committed to spend approximately  to purchase a facility in the second quarter of we recently entered into a lease agreement for a new facility in chesapeake  virginia  with future minimum rental payments of approximately  over the next years 
the two building facility is comprised of approximately  total square feet 
we expect capital expenditures in connection with tenant improvements  furniture and fixtures and other capital costs to be incurred through funding for these expenditures is expected to be from operating cash flows and existing cash balances 
on january   the company announced a stock repurchase program of up to  of its outstanding common stock over a two year period 
the company will repurchase shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time 
repurchases of stock will be at management s discretion  depending upon price and availability 
the repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock  which may be used to satisfy the company s current and near term requirements under its equity incentive and other benefit plans and for corporate purposes

will have no impact on operating results or financial position 
factors that may affect future operating results our business is heavily dependent on the pharmaceutical industry most of our customer relationship management products and services are currently used in connection with the marketing and sale of prescription only drugs 
this market is undergoing a number of significant changes 
these include o the significant consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry as well as the timing and sequencing of sales to our customers may reduce the number of our existing and potential customers  o regulatory changes that permit the over the counter sale of formerly prescription only drugs  and o competitive pressure on the pharmaceutical industry resulting from the continuing shift to delivery of healthcare through managed care organizations 
we cannot assure you that we can respond effectively to any or all of these and other changes in the marketplace 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not meet market expectations our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to lengthy sales and implementation cycles for our products  our fixed expenses in relation to our fluctuating revenues and variations in our customers budget cycles  each of which is discussed below 
as a result  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
it is also possible that in some future period our results of operations may be below our targeted goals and the expectations of the public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock may decline 
our lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues the selection of a crm solution generally entails an extended decision making process because of the strategic implications and substantial costs associated with a customer s license of the solution 
given the importance of the decision  senior levels of management often are involved and  in some instances  its board of directors may be involved in this process 
as a result  the decision making process typically takes nine to eighteen months  and in certain cases even longer 
accordingly  we cannot control or predict the timing of our execution of contracts with customers 
in addition  an implementation process of three to six or more months before the software is rolled out to a customer s sales force is customary 
however  if a customer were to delay or extend its implementation process  our quarterly revenues may decline below expected levels and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our fixed costs may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results if revenues fall below expectations we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and some of our other operating expenses based in large part on our expected future revenues and anticipated competitive conditions 
in particular  we frequently add staff in advance of new business to permit adequate time for training 
if the new business is subsequently delayed or canceled  we will have incurred expenses without the associated revenues 
in addition  we may increase sales and marketing expenses if competitive pressures become greater than originally anticipated 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies directly with our actual revenues  our operating results and profitability are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if our revenues fall below our targeted goals or expectations 
our business is affected by variations in our customers budget cycles we have historically realized a greater percentage of our license fees and service revenues in the second half of the year than in the first half because  among other things  our customers typically spend more of their annual budget authorization for crm solutions in the second half of the year 
however  the relationship between the amounts spent in the first and second halves of a year may vary from year to year and from customer to customer 
in addition  changes in our customers budget authorizations may reduce the amount of revenues we receive from the license of additional software or the provision of additional services 
as a result  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we depend on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers considering all affiliates of each customer as part of that customer 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer which includes the former parke davis division of warner lambert  johnson johnson and bristol myers squibb 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer and johnson johnson 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer and johnson johnson 
we believe that the costs to our customers of switching to a competitor s software product  or of taking significant system management functions in house  are substantial 
nevertheless  some of our customers have switched  and in the future other customers may switch  to software products and or services offered by our competitors or by in house staff 
if any of our major customers were to make such a change  our business  operating results or financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change the market for crm products changes rapidly because of frequent improvements in computer hardware and software technology 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to o use available technologies and data sources to develop new products and services and to enhance our current products and services  o introduce new solutions that keep pace with developments in our target markets  and o address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that respond to technological advances in the marketplace  or that we will do so in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that our products will adequately and competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
competition for software products has been characterized by shortening product cycles 
we may be materially and adversely affected by this trend if the product cycles for our products prove to be shorter than we anticipate 
if that happens  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we also may have to spend more of our revenues on product research and development than we have in the past 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
further  our software products are technologically complex and may contain previously undetected errors or failures 
such errors have occurred in the past and we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  our new products will be free from errors 
errors that result in losses or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services we believe there are a number of other companies that sell crm products and related services that specifically target the pharmaceutical industry  including o certain competitors that are actively selling crm software products in more than one country  and o certain competitors that also offer crm support services 
we believe the sfa and crm software products and or services offered by most of our competitors do not address the variety of pharmaceutical customer needs that our solutions address 
we also face competition from many vendors that market and sell sfa and crm solutions in the cpg market 
in addition  we also compete with various companies that provide support services similar to our services 
we believe our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including o the number and success of new market entrants supplying competing crm products or support services  o expansion of product lines by  or consolidation among  our existing competitors  and o development and or operation of in house crm software products or services by our customers and potential customers 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are part of large corporate groups and significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technology and other resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our international operations have risks that our domestic operations do not the sale of our products and services in foreign countries accounts for  and is expected in the future to account for  a material part of our revenues 
these sales are subject to risks inherent in international business activities  including o any adverse change in the political or economic environments in these countries  o any adverse change in tax  tariff and trade or other regulations  o the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  o exposure to exchange rate risk for service revenues which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  and o difficulties in managing an organization spread over various jurisdictions 
we may face risks associated with acquisitions our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business  including o the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position  o the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies  o the difficulty of integrating the acquired business  o the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  o the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business  o the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and o the maintenance of uniform  company wide standards  procedures and policies 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we expect that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  rights to purchase stock  or a combination of these 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing shareholders will experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
our success depends on retaining our key senior management team and on attracting and retaining qualified personnel our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales  technical and customer service personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel and we may experience such difficulties in the future 
any such difficulties could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our inability to manage our growth could adversely affect our business to manage our growth effectively we must continue to strengthen our operational  financial and management information systems and expand  train and manage our work force 
however  we may not be able to do so effectively or on a timely basis 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
our business depends on proprietary technology that we may not be able to protect completely we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of this technology 
further  protective actions we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we have  on occasion  in response to a request by our customer  entered into agreements which require us to place our source code in escrow to secure our service and maintenance obligations 
further  we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future that may result in the imposition of damages or injunctive relief against us 
in addition  any such claims may require us to enter into royalty arrangements 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
there are characteristics in the consumer packaged goods market that differ from the pharmaceutical market we market and sell crm solutions to companies in the cpg market 
the selling environment in this market has unique characteristics that differentiate it from the pharmaceutical market 
in addition  we believe that the cpg market is composed of sub markets  each of which may have unique characteristics 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to replicate in this market the success we have achieved in the ethical pharmaceutical market 
provisions of our charter documents and new jersey law may discourage an acquisition of dendrite provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our by laws  as amended  and new jersey law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
for example  the board of directors may  without the consent of the stockholders  issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
in addition  the company has a shareholder rights plan which may limit the ability of a third party to attempt a hostile acquisition of the company 
our common stock may be subject to price fluctuations the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors o the announcement or the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  o quarter to quarter variations in our operating results or changes in earnings estimates or failure to meet or exceed earnings estimates  o market conditions in the technology  healthcare and other growth sectors  and o general consolidation in the healthcare information industry which may result in the market perceiving us or other comparable companies as potential acquisition targets 
further  the stock market has experienced on occasion extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies have been especially volatile and often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk because we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in a foreign currency  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because we generally reinvest the cash flows from international operations 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one area may be offset by gains from another area 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place on january  the eleven participating countries will issue sovereign debt exclusively in euro and will redenominate outstanding sovereign debt 
the legal currencies will continue to be used as legal tender through january   at which point the legacy currencies will be canceled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
there can be no assurance that such euro conversion will not adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have not determined what impact  if any  the euro has on our foreign exchange exposure 
interest rate risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which primarily affects our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our short term investments consisted primarily of commercial paper maturing over the following three months 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income  of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments
