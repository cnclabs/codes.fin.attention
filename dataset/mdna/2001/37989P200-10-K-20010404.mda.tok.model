item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations december  versus december  continuing operations research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was principally attributable to the company s ongoing clinical trials of gbc  its lead drug candidate  partially offset by reduced spending on agricultural products 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally attributable to a reduction in consulting expense and officers compensation partially offset by increases in other salaries and rent 
marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was principally attributable to salaries and consulting expense for agriculture and human therapeutics not directly related to research and development 
during the second quarter  bradley j 
carver became the company s new chief executive officer to replace dr 
david platt and the company began a restructuring of operations 
in connection with dr 
platt s departure and other employee reductions  the company recorded a charge in the amount of  to cover associated costs 
see note interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was attributable to a reduction in cash available for investment 
discontinued operations on november   the company engaged a merchant bank to explore alternatives including sale or other disposition of the company s consumer  commercial and agriculture business areas 
the company terminated operations of the consumer and commercial product business areas on february  and began the process of liquidating all assets and liabilities pertaining to those operations 
accordingly  the company has treated its consumer and commercial products operations as a discontinued operation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and has reclassified the financial statements to reflect this treatment 
for the year ended december   the company has recorded a reserve in the amount of  which includes approximately  to reduce the carrying value of assets to their estimated liquidation value and a liability of approximately  to accrue for the cost of closing the operations 
the net losses of the discontinued operations are included in the statements of operations under discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations consists of the following year ended december  revenues   cost of revenues   gross margin loss   marketing expense   research and development expense   operating loss   provision for loss on discontinued operations  loss on discontinued operations   results of operations december  versus december  research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was principally attributable to the company s ongoing research activities on gbc  its lead drug candidate 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was principally attributable to a combination of additional administrative compensation costs and related employee benefits expenses 
marketing expenses were  for the year ended december  due to the reclassifications for discontinued operations  no comparison with would be meaningful 
marketing expenses were principally attributable to salaries  consultants and travel for agriculture and human therapeutics not directly related to research and development 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to an increase in cash available for investment due to cash proceeds received from six private placements of the company s securities during and and interest charged on notes receivable from related parties 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily with the proceeds from debt and equity securities totaling approximately  for the year ended december   the company s operations utilized cash of  primarily to fund the operating loss  including  for discontinued operations 
this use of cash was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of  to the company 
in  the company s operations utilized cash of  which was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were as follows computer  office and laboratory equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements  the company has no significant commitments for the purchase of equipment  product manufacturing or marketing efforts at present 
the company leases office facilities under an operating lease that ends in february rent expense for this space will be approximately  in the company is seeking to reduce its space from the current  square feet to approximately  square feet due to the reduced number of employees 
on january   safescience executed an agreement with wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute granting an exclusive world wide license to safescience to patents related to gbc material issued to or applied for by wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute 
this agreement adds the rights to these issued patents and patent applications to the company s existing portfolio of licensed patents and patent applications  consolidating the rights to all of the parties existing gbc intellectual property within safescience 
safescience made an initial payment of  upon signing the agreement and will pay an additional  in license payments over twelve months 
additional payments of up to  are contingent upon reaching future commercialization milestones 
the company also granted wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute warrants to purchase jointly  shares of common stock at that will vest in equal quarterly installments over two years beginning march  all payments made under this agreement will be recorded as research and development expense until such time as revenue is generated 
in addition  the company will pay a royalty jointly to wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute on net sales of gbc as of december   the company s cash balances were approximately  as compared to  as of december  the company has no bank lines of credit or other commercial financing sources at present but may seek such sources in the future 
it is not known whether additional funds could be borrowed from stockholders or other sources 
during the fourth quarter of  the company raised  in a private placement offering of common stock whereby  shares were sold at per share  as well as warrants to purchase  shares each at prices of   and per share exercisable for five years  and warrants to purchase  shares at per share for a total of  shares issuable upon exercise of warrants 
the purchasers have certain rights including  but not limited to  registration rights  and adjustments for certain events 
net proceeds from the offering were  the payment by one purchaser was not received by the company until january   and therefore was recorded as a stock subscription receivable at december  in the amount of  during the first quarter of  the company has raised  in a private placement offering of common stock whereby  shares were sold at a weighted average of per share 
the purchasers also received warrants to purchase  shares at prices ranging from to per share exercisable for five years  and warrants to purchase  shares at per share 
as of march   the company s cash and cash equivalents was approximately  the company believes that its existing funds will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned into june the company s future is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing to fund its operations 
the company is seeking to raise additional debt and or equity financing 
in the event the company is unable to obtain additional financing it will be required to substantially reduce or cease operations 
the company expects to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other which could positively or negatively affect results of operations and retained earnings 
as of december   the company has evaluated its risk and determined that any exposure to currency exchange is not significant to the company s overall consolidated financial results 
there can be no assurance that the company s exposure will remain at these levels  especially in the event of significant and sudden fluctuations in the value of local currencies 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the company maintains short term investments in an overnight money market account comprised of us treasury bills 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels that existed at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
certain factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing safescience  inc additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in those cases  the trading price of the common stock could decline 
we have experienced significant operating losses throughout our history  we expect these losses to continue and we may not achieve profitability in the future we began operations more than eight years ago and began to generate revenue only in the second quarter of through december   we have only generated  from product sales 
on february  we announced the discontinuation of our consumer and commercial product business from which all of our revenues to date have been generated 
we do not expect to generate product revenue for several years  if at all 
we have incurred approximately million of operating losses since our inception  including million in the year ended december  extensive operating losses can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
many of our products are still in development  there are uncertainties associated with research and development activities and we may be unable to bring new products to market many of our proposed products require further research  development  laboratory testing  regulatory approval and or demonstration of commercial scale manufacturing before they can be proven to be commercially viable 
many of these proposed products are in the development stage and are subject to the risks inherent in the development of new products  particularly those products based upon biotechnology 
potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that potential products are found during testing to be ineffective  or unsafe  that they fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  are difficult or uneconomical to manufacture on a large scale  fail to achieve market acceptance or are precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty when  or if  the research  development  testing and or regulatory approval process for our proposed products will be completed 
if research and development requires more funding than anticipated  we will have to reduce our product development efforts or seek additional financing 
our product development efforts may be unsuccessful  required regulatory approvals from us or foreign authorities may not be obtained  and products  if introduced  may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully marketed 
the failure of our research and development activities to result in any commercially viable products or technologies would materially adversely affect our future prospects 
we may not generate revenues in the future because we have ceased operation of our consumer and commercial product areas we have generated substantially all our revenues from our consumer and commercial products 
we have discontinued operations for our consumer and commercial product business and are exploring alternatives for our agricultural product business 
we will not generate revenues or other funds on an ongoing basis unless we receive current payments with respect to the sale of these areas or we are able to successfully bring to market pharmaceutical or agricultural products 
we may not be able to obtain additional funding when needed  which could reduce our ability to fund or expand operations we believe that our existing funds are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements into june we are pursuing additional funds through sales of our securities 
additional equity financing may result in dilution to our shareholders 
the resale of the common stock offered by selling stockholders may negatively affect our ability to obtain financing 
if the market price of our common stock declines  some potential investors may either refuse to offer us any financing or will offer financing at unacceptable rates or unfavorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms  we may be unable to fund or expand our operations or we may only be able to fund or expand our operations on terms that adversely affect our financial condition 
if we are unable to obtain financing necessary to fund our operations  we may have to sell or liquidate safescience 
our failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement on the property rights of others may impede our ability to operate freely we rely significantly upon proprietary technology 
to the extent that we currently rely upon unpatented  proprietary technology  processes and know how and the protection of such intellectual property by confidentiality agreements  others may independently develop similar technology and know how or confidentiality may be breached 
any claims against us or any purchaser or user of our products or patents  including gbc  asserting that our products or patents infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event a claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties and if we are unable to continue licensing this technology we may be unable to generate revenues we license our technology  including gbc  from third parties 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
this technology may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the technology we license from third parties would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any of these technology licenses would result in delays in the availability of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
the use of replacement technology from other third parties would require us to enter into license agreements with these third parties  which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation 
if our products are not accepted by agricultural and medical communities our business will suffer our principal product areas are agricultural products and pharmaceuticals 
commercial sales of our proposed products in these areas will substantially depend upon the products efficacy and on their acceptance by the agricultural and medical communities 
widespread acceptance of our products will require educating the agricultural and medical communities as to the benefits and reliability of the products 
our proposed products may not be accepted  and  even if accepted  we are unable to estimate the length of time it would take to gain such acceptance 
if the third parties we rely on for manufacturing our products are unable to produce the necessary amounts of our products  do not meet our quality needs or terminate their relationships with us  our business will suffer we do not presently have our own manufacturing operations  nor do we intend to establish any unless and until in the opinion of management  the size and scope of our business so warrants 
while we have established manufacturing relationships with firms that we believe will provide the capability to meet our anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future  we have not entered into any long term arrangements for manufacturing and such arrangements may not be obtained on desirable terms 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we will be dependent upon third parties to manufacture our products 
our reliance on independent manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in  access to necessary manufacturing processes and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes  we will have to identify acceptable alternative manufacturers 
the use of a new manufacturer may cause significant interruptions in supply if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing products to our specifications 
further  the introduction of a new manufacturer may increase the variation in the quality of our products 
we face intense competition and rapid technological changes in the markets in which we compete  and our failure to successfully compete or adopt to changing technology could make it difficult to acquire and retain customers many companies  including large pharmaceutical  chemical  biotechnology and agricultural concerns  universities and other research institutions  with financial resources and research and development staffs and facilities substantially greater than ours  may develop or attempt to develop products that compete with our products 
these companies may have the ability to devote far greater resources to researching  developing and marketing their products than we are able to do 
in addition  the biotechnology industry is one in which technological change is extremely rapid 
our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards together with regulatory changes and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be significant factors in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
any products which we do develop may become technologically obsolete before we have had the ability to realize significant revenues or profits 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation and failure to achieve regulatory approval of our products would severely harm our business the fda regulates the manufacture  distribution and promotion of pharmaceutical products in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and related regulations 
we must receive premarket approval by the fda for any commercial sale of our pharmaceutical products 
before receiving such approval we must provide proof in human clinical trials of the nontoxicity  safety and efficacy of our pharmaceutical products  which trials can take several years 
premarket approval is a lengthy and expensive process 
we may not be able to obtain fda approval for any commercial sale of our product 
by regulation  the fda has days to review an application for approval to market a pharmaceutical product  however  the fda frequently exceeds the day time period 
in addition  based on its review  the fda may determine that additional clinical trials are required 
except for any potential licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies  we will not generate any revenues in connection with our pharmaceutical products unless and until we obtain fda approval to sell our products in commercial quantities for human application 
the investigation  manufacture and sale of agricultural products is subject to regulation by the epa  including the need for approval before marketing  and by comparable foreign and state agencies 
our agricultural products will be able to be commercially marketed for use either in the united states or other countries only by first obtaining the necessary approvals 
while we hope to obtain regulatory approvals for our proposed products  we may not obtain these approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
reimbursement procedures and future healthcare reform measures are uncertain and may adversely impact the sale of our pharmaceutical products our ability to sell our pharmaceutical products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse patients for the costs of our pharmaceutical products and related treatments 
in the united states  government and other third party payers have sought to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products approved for marketing by the fda 
in some cases  these payers may refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products to treat medical conditions even though the fda has granted marketing approval 
healthcare reform may increase these cost containment efforts 
we believe that managed care organizations may seek to restrict the use of new products  delay authorization to use new products or limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products 
internationally  where national healthcare systems are prevalent  little if any funding may be available for new products  and cost containment and cost reduction efforts can be more pronounced than in the united states 
issuances of our securities are subject to federal and state securities laws and certain prior offerings of our securities may not have complied with applicable securities laws issuances of securities are subject to federal and state securities laws 
certain prior private placement offerings of our securities may not have complied with requirements of applicable state securities laws 
in such situations a number of remedies may be available to regulatory authorities and stockholders who purchased securities in such offerings  including  without limitation  rescission rights 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to retain and hire additional qualified personnel as necessary our success will depend on our ability to retain key employees and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain existing personnel or attract qualified employees in the future 
at present  we employ approximately full time employees and one part time worker 
we depend upon the personal efforts and abilities of our officers and directors  and would be materially adversely affected if their services ceased to be available for any reason and comparable replacement personnel were not employed 
the businesses in which we engage have a risk of product liability  and in the event of a successful suit against us  our business could be severely harmed the testing  marketing and sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims by consumers and others 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance which we believe to be adequate  such insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or may not be sufficient to fully cover any potential claims 
in the event of a successful suit against us  the lack or insufficiency of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are contractually obligated to issue shares in the future as of december  there were outstanding options to purchase  shares of common stock  at a weighted average exercise price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
moreover  we may in the future issue additional shares to raise capital  acquire other companies or technologies  to pay for services  or for other corporate purposes 
any such issuances will have the effect of further diluting the interest of current shareholders 
we must comply with the listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market or our common stock and liquidity would decline our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq stock market if the bid price of our common stock falls below per share for thirty consecutive business days  if we have less than  in net tangible assets total assets less total liabilities and goodwill and our market capitalization falls below million  or if the value of our common stock held by our stockholders other than our directors and executive officers is less than  on certain days in march our common stock traded at prices below per share 
if nasdaq delisted our common stock  we would likely seek to list our common stock for quotation on a regional stock exchange 
however  if we are unable to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange  trading of our common stock would occur in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board for unlisted securities or in what are commonly known as the pink sheet 
in addition  delisting from nasdaq and failure to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange would subject our common stock to so called penny stock rules 
these rules impose additional sales practice and market making requirements on broker dealers who sell and or make a market in such securities 
consequently  broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell and or make a market in our common stock 
additionally  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of  our common stock 
finally  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our securities 
if a significant number of shares become available for sale our stock price could decline many shares of common stock presently issued and outstanding are restricted securities as that term is defined in rule promulgated under the act 
in general  under rule  a person or persons whose shares are aggregated who has satisfied a one year holding period may sell  within any three month period  an amount which does not exceed the greater of of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale 
rule also permits the sale of shares  under certain circumstances  without any quantity limitation  by persons who are not affiliates of safescience and who have beneficially owned the shares for a minimum period of two years 
the possible sale of these restricted shares may  in the future  increase the number of free trading shares and may have a depressive effect on the price of our securities 
moreover  such sales  if substantial  might also adversely effect our ability to raise additional equity capital 
because our current management controls a significant percentage of our common stock  they have substantial control over us the holders of the common stock do not have cumulative voting rights 
two of our directors  one of whom is an executive officer of safescience  own approximately collectively of the outstanding shares of common stock 
these stockholders can substantially influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could materially adversely affect our stock price 
the price of our common stock has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses by you the market price of the common stock  which is traded on the national association of securities dealers automated quotation nasdaq small cap has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the biotechnology sector  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products  either by us or by our competitors or third parties  as well as market conditions within the various industries in which we compete  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
an investment in our stock is speculative and entails a high degree of risk there is nothing at this time upon which to base an assumption that our plans for our business will prove successful 
if our plans prove unsuccessful  the purchasers of our shares may lose all or a substantial part of their investment 
our operations are subject to numerous risks associated with the development of agricultural and pharmaceutical products  including the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate 
in addition  we may encounter unanticipated problems  including manufacturing  distributing and marketing difficulties  some of which may be beyond our financial and technical abilities to resolve 
the failure adequately to address such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and our financial condition 
we have not paid and do not intend to pay any dividends to date  we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
our board of directors does not intend to declare any cash dividends in the foreseeable future  but instead intends to retain all earnings  if any  for use in our business operations 
furthermore  as we may be required to obtain additional financing  there may be restrictions on our ability to declare any cash dividends on common stock in the future
