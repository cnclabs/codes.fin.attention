the company s primary capital needs have consisted of acquisitions of inventory  financing accounts receivable and capital expenditures for product development 
the company s operating activities used net cash of million during fiscal  consisting primarily of increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million and was a result of capital expenditures and the acquisition of meritus  partially offset by a decrease in other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and was a result of related party borrowings to facilitate the meritus acquisition  the payment of assumed meritus debt and borrowings under revolving lines of credit 
the company s working capital at december  was million and unrestricted cash was  the seasonal nature of the toy business results in complex working capital needs 
the company s working capital needs  which the company generally satisfies through short term borrowings  are greatest in the last two fiscal quarters 
to manage these working capital requirements  the company maintains the hong kong credit and the revolver 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under the revolver 
sunrock has executed a written waiver of these covenant violations for the period ending december  in addition  the company and sunrock amended the revolver on march  resulting in an increase in the maximum loan amount from million to million  subject to the availability of sufficient  eligible inventory and accounts receivable

based on projected fiscal operating results  the company believes cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the revolver and the hong kong credit facility  as well as proceeds from the investment warrant  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements and fund its anticipated capital expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance the company will meet its projected operating results 
in connection with any future cash needs or acquisition opportunities  the company may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors

the company used those funds to finance the normal business operations of the company 
in connection with the acquisition of meritus  the company borrowed million from mvii 
the debt is evidenced by a promissory note dated january  the note bears interest at a rate of prime plus  matures on july  and is subordinate to the revolver 
the proceeds from the note were used primarily to facilitate the merger with meritus  including the satisfaction of meritus debt  described below
