item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview intermune develops and commercializes innovative products for the treatment of serious pulmonary and infectious diseases and cancer 
we have two marketed products  growing product revenues  and advanced stage clinical programs 
in the united states  we market our lead product  actimmune  for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease  a life threatening congenital disorder of the immune system  and severe  malignant osteopetrosis  a life threatening congenital disorder causing an overgrowth of bony structures 
in january  we began marketing amphotec worldwide for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis  a life threatening systemic fungal infection 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred in research and development  sales and marketing and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we expand our clinical trial activities for our target diseases 
our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to commercialize actimmune 
expansion of our operations will also add to our expenses 
as a result  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we have a limited history of operations and anticipate that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including market acceptance of current or new products  patent conflicts  the introduction of new products by our competitors  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  and the timing of significant orders 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
on june   we entered into the revenue adjustment agreement with connetics corporation by which we acquired from connetics the rights to those actimmune revenues under the baseline that we did not already own established by the transition agreement with connetics  dated april  
beginning with the three month period ended june   we recorded all actimmune revenues and related expenses that had been previously transacted for connetics 
these sales  costs of sales and accounts receivable were recorded by us on a net basis  in the accompanying financial statements for the period from february  inception to december   the year ended december  and the three month period ended march  such sales  costs of sales and accounts receivable were not previously subject to the risks and rewards of ownership by us 
the revenue adjustment agreement terminated the transition agreement  collaboration agreement and section of the assignment agreement with connetics 
deferred stock compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million and million in the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date such options were granted and the applicable exercise prices 
such amount is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of the individual options  which is generally five years 
this graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall award at interim dates and results in higher vesting in earlier years than straight line vesting 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we had a total of million to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total revenues were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the revenues in represented our portion of actimmune sales that exceeded the annual contractual baseline established with connetics in effect at that time

beginning with the three month period ending june   our revenues reflect all sales for actimmune 
the revenues in represent all sales from april  to december  of actimmune in the united states and sales outside the united states related to a supply arrangement 
for all of and the three month period ended march   sales transacted for connetics below the annual contractual baseline were recorded on a net basis  which was zero  and any amounts in excess of net revenues less costs to produce and market were paid to connetics

research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
of the increased costs in the year  a total of million is related to non cash stock based compensation and the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the remaining increase in was due primarily to increased costs for clinical trial expenses for actimmune in new disease indications and the expenses associated with our transfer of actimmune to an additional manufacturing facility 
these costs have been recorded as research and development expenses as the new facility is not yet operational 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or million 
of the increased costs in  a total of million is related to the amortization of deferred stock compensation

we recorded a deemed dividend of million in january  upon the issuance of  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
at the dates of issuance  we believed the per share price of represented the fair value of the preferred stock and was in excess of the deemed fair value of our common stock 
subsequent to the commencement of our initial public offering process  we re evaluated the deemed fair value of our common stock and determined it to be to per share 
accordingly  the aggregate proceeds of million fair value is deemed to be the equivalent of a preferred stock dividend 
we recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to additional paid in capital of million  without any effect on total stockholders equity 
the amount increased the loss applicable to common stockholders in the calculation of basic net loss per share the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
due to operating losses and the inability to recognize the benefits therefrom  there is no provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of depository accounts  master notes and liquidity optimized investment contracts 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by approximately  at december   the average maturity of our available for sale securities was days 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restricts its exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  the company maintains investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years
