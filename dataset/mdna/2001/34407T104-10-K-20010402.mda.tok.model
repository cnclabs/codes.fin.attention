outlook this outlook section and the liquidity and capital resources section below contain forward looking statements 
the company s actual results may differ materially 
factors that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from the expectations described here include the ability of the company to obtain favorable financing terms for its aircraft  the ability of the aircraft manufacturers to deliver aircraft on schedule  unexpected costs or delays in the implementation of new service  the ability of the company to successfully retire the company s turboprop fleet  the ability to hire and retain employees  the weather  the impact of labor issues or strikes at united airlines  inc or delta air lines  inc 
on those companies utilization and support of the company s operations  airport and airspace congestion  changes in and satisfaction of regulatory requirements including requirements relating to fleet expansion  and general economic and industry conditions 
a number of risks and uncertainties exist with regard to the company s agreement with ual corporation ual  parent of united airlines  inc united to acquire through subsidiaries the three regional airlines that are currently wholly owned by us airways group  inc us airways which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projected results 
such factors relating to the transaction include  among others  ual s termination rights  ability to reach agreement with ual on the ultimate purchase price  ability to obtain regulatory approval with respect to the transaction  financing of the final purchase price  unanticipated unreimbursed costs  ability of the three companies to operate as fully independent corporations  ability to resolve any conflicting provisions in collective bargaining agreements obligating any company involved in the transaction  potential turboprop fleet transition issues  satisfactory resolution of amendable union contracts  operational issues involving any of the three airlines  and the impact of these new operations on existing operations 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward looking information included in this release  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in expectations or otherwise 
effective december   the company now operates all of its flights under guaranteed fee per departure or fee per block hour agreements with united and delta  respectively 
under these types of arrangements  the company is contractually obligated to operate the flight schedule  for which the company is then compensated at an agreed amount per departure or block hour regardless of passenger ticket revenue 
in addition  the company may receive additional incentive payments based on operational performance 
as a result  the company assumes the risk associated with operating the flight schedule  and united and delta assume the risk of scheduling  marketing  and selling seats to the traveling public 
the company provides all regional jet service for its delta connection operations and is continuing its transformation to all regional jet service for its existing united express operation 
in addition to the crjs and jets in service as of march   the company has firm orders for an additional crjs and jets and option orders for crjs and jets and long term marketing agreements with united airlines  inc and delta air lines  inc 
to fly the firm ordered jet aircraft in united express and delta connection service 
in january  the company reached an agreement with united and delta to place crj s originally ordered for the delta connection program in the united express program 
during  the company early retired seven j turboprop aircraft  has finalized plans to early retire the remaining j s by the end of  and is evaluating plans to early retire its fleet of j turboprop aircraft beginning in the addition of the firm ordered regional jets  net of the removal from service of all of the turboprop aircraft  will allow the company to grow capacity as measured in asm s  based on planned aircraft delivery dates  by approximately in and in with the restructuring charge taken on the j turboprop aircraft in  their exit from the fleet is anticipated not to have any impact on future earnings 
the company is evaluating plans to early retire the j turboprop aircraft from its fleet beginning in adoption of a plan to retire the j turboprop fleet would likely result in a substantial charge to future earnings 
the company is unable at this time to quantify the amount of any such retirement charge  as a formal plan has not yet been adopted 
acjet commenced revenue service with jets during the third quarter of and added crjs during the fourth quarter of acjet incurred approximately million in start up expenses from inception through commencement of revenue service  which were expensed as incurred 
the company will recover million of these costs  which will be recorded as revenue over the next three years 
the company plans to combine the operations of acjet into the operations of aca during the first half of this combination is contingent on the company receiving the required approvals from the federal aviation administration and the department of transportation 
during  united airlines and us airways announced plans for a merger  with united airlines being the successor company 
the two companies have recently stated that they continue to await governmental approvals for the merger to proceed and anticipate the closing to be delayed beyond the previously announced date of april  on march   the company announced it entered into an agreement with ual to acquire through subsidiaries the three regional airlines that are currently wholly owned by us airways 
the three carriers are allegheny airlines  piedmont airlines and psa airlines 
closing of the acquisition from us airways  which would be contingent upon and occur at the same time as closing of the proposed united us airways merger  is subject to regulatory approvals and to termination rights by ual 
the aggregate purchase price for the three carriers  initially set at million  will be paid at closing in the form of a promissory note due in months 
under the terms of the agreement  the company will not remit principal or interest payments or accrue interest on the note until and if an agreement is finalized 
the ultimate purchase price for each of the three regional carriers will be negotiated during the month term of the promissory note 
if agreement cannot be reached on an ultimate purchase price as to any or all of the three carriers  the company s acquisition of that carrier will be unwound 
the ultimate purchase price paid by the company may vary substantially from the amount of the promissory note  and there can be no assurances that the company will retain any or all of the three carriers 
if closing occurs on the initial purchase of the three carriers but the company is not the ultimate purchaser of at least one of the carriers  the company will receive a fee of up to million 
the results of operations  and any capital requirements of the three regional carriers  are not expected to contribute to the company s results of operations or impact its financial position until and if an ultimate purchase price is agreed to and the acquisition can no longer be unwound 
slots are reservations for takeoffs and landings at specified times and are required by governmental authorities to operate at certain airports 
the company has rights to and utilizes takeoff and landing slots at chicago o hare and laguardia  kennedy and white plains  new york airports 
the company also uses slot exemptions at chicago o hare  which differ from slots in that they allow service only to designated cities and are not transferable to other airlines without the approval of the us department of transportation dot 
airlines may acquire slots by governmental grant  by lease or purchase from other airlines  or by loan when another airline does not use a slot but desires to avoid governmental reallocation of a slot for lack of use 
all leased and loaned slots are subject to renewal and termination provisions 
under rules presently in effect  all slot regulation is scheduled to end at chicago o hare after july  and at laguardia and kennedy after january  the rules also provide that  in addition to those slots currently held by carriers  operators of regional jet aircraft may apply for  and the secretary of transportation must grant  additional slots at chicago  laguardia  and kennedy in order to permit the carriers to offer new service  increase existing service or upgrade to regional jet service in qualifying smaller communities 
there is no limit on the number of slots a carrier may request 
the company still expects to apply for additional slots as permitted by the new rules 
the ability of regional carriers to obtain slots at laguardia in large numbers led to an increase in flight activity at the airport that exceeded the capacity of laguardia 
as a result  and to reduce airport congestion and delays  the faa implemented a slot lottery system resulting in a decrease in the operation of new regional jet service to and from laguardia including acjet services operated for delta 
in addition  aca is unable to increase service at laguardia given limits on the number of slots and the impact of the slot lottery 
the slot lottery is a temporary measure  and the faa is considering implementing a long term solution that could involve increasing landing and other fees to discourage operations during peak hours 
to the extent other airports experience significant flight delays  the faa or local airport operators could seek to impose similar peak period pricing systems or other demand reducing strategies which could impede the company s ability to serve any such impacted airport 
the company has not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and expects to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet its future requirements 
during  the company hedged a portion of its exposure to jet fuel price fluctuations by entering into commodity swap contracts for approximately of its fuel requirements for the united express program 
delta air lines  inc bears the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations for the fuel requirements of the company s delta connection program  and united airlines bears such risk for the company s united express program beginning on december  as such  the company expects that its results of operations will no longer be directly affected by fuel price volatility 
the company s regional jet fleet is comprised of new aircraft with an average age of less than one and one half years 
since maintenance expense on new aircraft is lower in the early years of operation due to manufacturers warranties and the generally lower failure rates of major components  the company s maintenance expense for regional jet aircraft will increase in future periods 
in  the company has executed a seven year engine services agreement with ge engine services  inc ge covering the scheduled and unscheduled repair of aca s cf b jet engines  operated on the crjs already delivered or on order for the united express operation 
this agreement was amended in july to cover additional crj aircraft  bringing the total number of crj aircraft covered under the agreement to under the terms of the agreement  the company pays a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis to ge and ge assumes the responsibility to repair the engines when required at no additional expense to the company  subject to certain exclusions 
the company expenses the amount paid to ge based on the monthly rates stipulated in the agreement  as engine hours are flown 
the company s future maintenance expense on crj engines covered under the new agreement will escalate based on contractual rate increases  intended to match the timing of actual maintenance events that are due pursuant to the terms 
the company has signed a similar agreement covering engines for up to jets with pratt whitney  and also anticipates signing a similar agreement for the remaining regional jets on order 
in  the company commenced a replacement project of its computer software systems 
the company engaged ibm to define functional requirements  evaluate vendor packages  and select and implement software solutions 
new systems will include general ledger  payroll  accounts payable  accounts receivable  human resources administration  and maintenance 
implementation is scheduled to be completed during the company anticipates spending approximately million on this project  the majority of which will be capitalized and amortized over five years 
in  the company expensed approximately  related to replacement software selection and capitalized million in acquisition and implementation costs 
in  an additional million was capitalized  bringing the total capitalized costs to date to million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents increased million  reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of million  net cash used in investing activities of million related to aircraft purchase deposits  purchases of aircraft and equipment and increases in short term investments and net cash used in financing activities of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the restated ua agreements  effective december   in which the company is now paid weekly in advance for monthly revenue as compared to receiving monthly revenue to days after the end of a month 
net cash used in financing activities was mainly related to payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations and purchases of treasury stock 
in order to minimize total aircraft rental expense over the entire life of the related aircraft leveraged lease transactions  the company has uneven semiannual lease payment dates of january and july for its crj aircraft 
currently  approximately of the company s annual lease payments are due in january and are due in july 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased million  reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of million  net cash used in investing activities of million related to aircraft purchase deposits  purchases of aircraft and equipment and increases in short term investments and net cash provided by financing activities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities increased due to the issuance of million of long term debt principally to acquire two crj aircraft  partially offset by the company s common stock repurchase program 
other financing in february  the company entered in to an asset based lending agreement with two financial institutions that provides the company with a line of credit for up to million depending on the amount of assigned ticket receivables and the value of certain rotable spare parts 
the line of credit will expire on september   or upon termination of the united express marketing agreement  whichever is sooner 
the interest rate on this line is libor plus 
to depending on the company s fixed charges coverage ratio 
there were no borrowings on the line during or the company pledged million of this line of credit as collateral for letters of credit issued on behalf of the company by a financial institution 
with the change in the united express agreement going from a prorate arrangement to a fee per departure payment in advance arrangement effective december   the company s ticket receivable available for assignment has been reduced to zero 
as such  the available borrowing under the line of credit is limited to the value of certain rotable spare parts 
the company anticipates replacing this existing line of credit with a smaller more economical line of credit when the current line expires on september  as of march   the available amount of credit under the line was million 
in july  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due july  the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
in january  approximately million of the notes were converted  pursuant to their original terms  into  shares of common stock 
from march  to april   the company temporarily reduced the conversion price from to for holders of the notes 
during this period  million of the notes converted into approximately million shares of common stock 
as a result of this temporary price reduction  the company recorded a non cash  non operating charge to earnings during the second quarter of of million representing the fair value of the additional shares distributed upon conversion 
interest on the notes is payable on april and october of each year 
on may   the company called the remaining million principal amount of notes outstanding  for redemption at of face value  effective july  the noteholders elected to convert all of the notes into common stock and approximately million shares were issued in exchange for the notes during the period may  to june   resulting in an addition to paid in capital of approximately million offset by a reduction of approximately  for the unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the notes in connection with their conversion 
in september  approximately million of pass through certificates were issued in a private placement by separate pass through trusts  which purchased with the proceeds  equipment notes the equipment notes issued in connection with i leveraged lease transactions relating to four j s and six crjs  all of which were leased to the company the leased aircraft  and ii the financing of four j s owned by the company the owned aircraft 
the equipment notes issued with respect to the owned aircraft are direct obligations of aca  guaranteed by acai and are included as debt obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the equipment notes issued with respect to the leased aircraft are not obligations of aca or guaranteed by acai 
other commitments the company s board of directors has approved the purchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions 
as of march   the company has purchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share 
the company has approximately million remaining of the million authorization 
aircraft the company has significant lease obligations for aircraft that are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
the remaining terms of such leases range from one to sixteen and three quarters years 
the company s total rent expense in under all non cancelable aircraft operating leases was approximately million 
as of december   the company s minimum annual rental payments for under all non cancelable aircraft operating leases with remaining terms of more than one year were approximately million 
as of march   the company had a total of canadair regional jets crjs on order from bombardier  inc  and held options for additional crjs 
the company also has a firm order with fairchild aerospace corporation for fairchild dornier seat regional jet jet aircraft  and options for additional jets 
of the firm ordered aircraft deliveries  are scheduled for  are scheduled for  and are scheduled for the company is obligated to purchase and finance including leveraged leases the firm ordered aircraft at an approximate capital cost of billion 
the company anticipates leasing all of its year aircraft deliveries on terms similar to previously delivered regional jet aircraft 
aircraft orders are subject to price escalation formulas based on certain indices designed to reflect increased costs in the production of the aircraft 
during and during the first quarter of  the rate of escalation has increased  and such increases will be reflected in future aircraft cost or lease rates 
on march  and march  the company acquired through leveraged lease transactions its th and th jet aircraft 
on march  the company acquired through leveraged lease transactions its st crj aircraft 
the lease terms are for approximately years 
during  the company announced orders for a total of aircraft from fairchild aerospace corporation  including jets seat capacity and jets seat capacity 
the jets were an aircraft under development  with initial deliveries scheduled for in august fairchild aerospace announced that it would not proceed with development of the jets 
in january  the company reached a series of agreements with fairchild resolving all issues relating to the initial order 
under the new agreements  the company revised its order for jets to a total of aircraft 
the company also placed an order for additional crjs with bombardier aerospace in august  which are included in the firm ordered aircraft described above 
during  the company began early retiring the leased seat j aircraft from the fleet 
as of march   ten j s had been removed from service 
the remaining j s will be removed from service during the remainder of the early retirement of the leased j aircraft resulted in the company recording a million pre tax restructuring charge during during march  the company reached agreement with the lessor for the early return and lease termination of all of the j s and as a result paid a lease termination fee which consisted of million in cash  and the application of million in credits due from the lessor 
the company believes that the remainder of the accrual will be adequate to provide for costs necessary to meet aircraft return conditions 
the early termination of these leases and the return of these aircraft prior to lease expiration will enable the company to satisfy its lease obligations and does not require the company to assume the risks and efforts required to maintain and remarket the aircraft 
the company does not expect to incur any additional charges against earnings for the early retirement of the j fleet 
the company is evaluating plans to early retire the j turboprop aircraft from its fleet beginning in adoption of a plan to retire the j turboprop fleet would likely result in a substantial charge to future earnings 
the company is unable at this time to quantify the amount of any such retirement charge  as a formal plan has not yet been adopted 
in order to ensure the highest level of safety in air transportation  the faa has authority to issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders 
these relate to  among other things  the inspection of aircraft and the mandatory removal and replacement of parts or structures 
in addition  the faa from time to time amends its regulations and such amended regulations may impose additional regulatory burdens on the company  such as the required installation of new safety related items 
depending upon the scope of the faa s orders and amended regulations  these requirements may cause the company to incur substantial  unanticipated expenses which may not be reimbursable under the company s marketing agreements 
the faa enforces its maintenance regulations by the imposition of civil penalties  which can be substantial 
capital equipment and debt service in the company anticipates capital spending of approximately million consisting of million in rotable spare parts  million for spare engines and equipment  and million for other capital assets  and expects to finance these capital expenditures out of working capital 
principal payments on long term debt for are estimated to be approximately million reflecting borrowings related to the purchase of four crj aircraft acquired in and and five j s acquired in and the foregoing amount does not include additional debt that may be required for the financing of new crjs  jets  spare parts and spare engines 
the company believes that  in the absence of unusual circumstances  its cash flow from operations and other available equipment financing will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs  expected operating lease commitments  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements for the next twelve months

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and all hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at their fair values 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its designation and effectiveness 
for derivatives that qualify as effective hedges  the change in fair value will have no impact on earnings until the hedged item affects earnings
