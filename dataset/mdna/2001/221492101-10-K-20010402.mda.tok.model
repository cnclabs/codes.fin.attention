overview cost u less began operations in by opening a mid sized warehouse club style store in maui  hawaii 
the company s store concept was successful in the smaller  and in many ways more challenging  island markets 
the company began experimenting in late with similar stores in various mainland markets 
over the course of a three year period  the company opened six mainland stores and seven island stores 
however  the company found that most of the mainland stores did not meet the company s performance expectations 
the company therefore focused on its core competencies in operating island stores and began closing its mainland stores 
currently only one mainland store remains open and serves as an efficient testing ground for new operating and merchandising methods 
the company intends to retain this store while targeting its future growth on island markets 
in  the company opened two stores in fiji  and in the company opened two stores in new zealand and one in curacao 
a central focus for the company in was to improve the mix of stores in its relatively small store base  as under performing stores can have a materially adverse impact on company performance 
in june  the company closed its two stores located in new zealand and in december  the company decided to close its nadi  fiji store effective february in the new zealand market  the company had introduced what it believed to be the first warehouse club concept to a significantly larger but more competitive marketplace 
however  the strong customer loyalty to regional products that compete with the us brands primarily sold by the company  resulted in sales that were below expectations 
the company s decision to close the nadi store is due primarily to the impact that the political turmoil in fiji was having on the tourist industry 
the resulting economic downturn severely impacted the performance of its store in nadi 
these actions were in line with the company s strategy of evaluating its existing locations and operations in an effort to improve profitability and cash flow 
on june  the company opened a store on the island of st maarten in the caribbean 
the company believes this island market has market conditions that resemble those in islands in which the company has been successful 
in  the company will continue its focus on its core island store operations 
the company will also be reviewing its merchandising strategies  both those that apply to all stores and those specific to each store in light of the different conditions in each market 
the company will also analyze opportunities for future expansion 
while management believes these actions can improve profitability  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful
