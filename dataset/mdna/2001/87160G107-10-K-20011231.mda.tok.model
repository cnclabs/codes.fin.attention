statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations which express that we believe  anticipate  expect or plan to as well as other statements which are not historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual events or results may differ materially as a result of the risks and uncertainties described herein and elsewhere including  but not limited to  those factors discussed in additional cautionary statements section in this item we do not intend to update these forward looking statements 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell medical devices 
our core business is in our bipolar electrosurgical generators and related instrumentation  based on our patented dualwave tm technology 
our bipolar systems allow a surgeon or dentist to cut tissue in a manner that minimizes collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue and to coagulate blood vessels quickly  safely and efficiently 
by essentially eliminating damage to surrounding healthy tissue  the surgeon can work safely in direct contact with nerves  blood vessels  bone and metal implants 
our bipolar systems are designed to replace other surgical tools  such as monopolar systems  lasers and conventional instruments  used in soft tissue surgery 
our patented dualwave tm technology is applicable to many surgical markets 
our bipolar systems are currently used to perform many types of neurosurgery  spine surgery and dental surgery 
we have entered into a distribution agreement with codman shurtleff  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  inc  to market our neurosurgery bipolar systems 
we have also entered into a distribution agreement with bident international  llc  a subsidiary of garfield refinery  inc  to market our bident r dental bipolar system 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our sales from our neurosurgery bipolar system 
in fiscal and  we also received a contribution to our sales revenue from sales of our bident r bipolar dental system 
our strategy includes expanding our patented dualwave tm technology in neurosurgery and to broaden the market for our bipolar systems and instrumentation in the dental market and other surgical markets 
our strategy also includes having our existing base of neurosurgery bipolar generators and our dental bipolar generators  as well as bipolar generators we sell in other fields drive our sale of disposable hand held instruments and tubing sets 
results of operations revenues sales of  for fiscal were greater than sales of  for fiscal and greater than sales of  for the increases year over year are due to increasing unit sales of current products and unit sales of newly introduced products in the dental market and in the field of neurosurgery 
codman shurtleff accounted for of our sales in and and of our sales in and  respectively 
we commenced selling our disposable hand held instruments to codman shurtleff for use in neurosurgery in we believe that as neurosurgeons become aware of the advantages of disposable instrumentation over traditional instrumentation and our introduction of more types of disposable hand held instruments  our sales of disposable hand held instruments in neurosurgery in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of total sales in neurosurgery will increase 
on december   we entered into a new distribution agreement with codman shurtleff under which codman shurtleff was granted the exclusive worldwide right to sell our neurosurgery bipolar systems and certain other products in the field of neurocranial and neurospinal surgery through december  on the condition that codman shurtleff makes minimum purchases of million per calendar year  as may be adjusted by mutual agreement of the parties 
if codman fails to satisfy the minimum purchase obligations  our remedy is to terminate the agreement or convert it into a nonexclusive agreement 
we also commenced selling our bident r bipolar dental system in since then  sales of the bident r bipolar dental system  which includes a bipolar generator  disposable hand held instruments and a single use cord set to connect the generator to the hand held instrument  have risen to approximately  or of our sales  in  from approximately of our sales in and less than of our sales in since there are many more dentists than there are neurosurgeons  we believe that sales of our bident r bipolar dental system will become a much more significant part of our revenues in the future 
sales of disposable products accounted for approximately  or of our sales  in as compared to approximately  or of our sales  and approximately  or of our sales  in and  respectively 
approximately of our sales related to sales of bipolar electrosurgical generators  irrigators and accessories as compared to approximately and of our sales in and  respectively 
cost of product sales cost of sales for fiscal was  or of sales  compared with  or of sales  for during fiscal  cost of sales was  or of sales 
the absolute dollar increase of  in cost of sales for fiscal over fiscal and the  increase for fiscal over fiscal were due to increased unit sales of disposable products and generators 
gross margin was for as compared to for and for the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales is attributable to changes in product mix  increased manufacturing efficiency and increased production volume 
we cannot be sure that gross margins will remain at current levels or show improvement in the future due to the distribution channels used  product mix  and fluctuation in manufacturing production levels and overhead costs as new products are introduced 
in addition  inefficiencies in manufacturing new products and the distribution channels utilized to sell those products may adversely impact gross margin 
operating expenses we continued our commitment to research and development in by increasing our research and development expense to  a increase over research and development expenditures of  for research and development expenses were  in research and development expenses were of sales in as compared to of sales in and the increases in spending in and are attributable primarily to continued development of new products in neurosurgery and the dental market  and the continued development of new products for new markets 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to  or of sales  in  from  or of sales  in  and from  or of sales  in overall  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was attributable to expenses to grow our business 
in  we plan to lease a new facility to consolidate our two present facilities in a single location in order to achieve efficiencies and to accommodate future growth 
as a result  we anticipate that our office lease expenses will increase in the future 
we also anticipate that other general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of sales  but will increase in dollar amounts as we incur additional business development activities 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  increased slightly for to  from  for and from  for at the end of  we had  in cash and cash equivalents as compared to  at the end of and  at the end of we anticipate that interest and other income  net  will increase due to the increased cash balances 
income tax benefit provision the provision for income taxes was  for as compared to an income tax benefit of  and  for and  respectively 
our effective tax rate in was approximately 
net income loss net income before the cumulative effect of the adoption of sab increased to  for  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal  and a net loss of  for basic and diluted income per share was 
for as compared to a loss per basic and diluted share of 
and 
for and  respectively 
net income for the current fiscal year reflects an increase in sales and gross margin 
although we have been profitable on a quarterly basis since the third quarter of fiscal  due to our operating history and numerous other factors  we cannot be sure that we can sustain revenue growth or profitability 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of  we had  in working capital compared to  at the end of and  at the end of the primary measures of our liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventory balances  as well as our borrowing ability 
the cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
cash generated by operating activities was  for fiscal  which was mainly attributable to increased operating profits  a decrease in accounts receivable and deferred tax assets and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
this was partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid items 
accounts receivable net of allowances decreased by  in to a total of  at the end of fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable was principally due to the reduction in the number of days our invoices were outstanding 
inventories increased by  in to a total of  at the end of compared to  at the end of the increase was primarily to support the anticipated increasing sales activity 
we expect future inventory levels to increase in absolute dollar value in order to support sales volume increases and as we expand into additional markets 
net property and equipment decreased to  at the end of as compared to  for cash used for financing activities was  in as a result of the repurchase of  shares of our common stock in the first quarter of pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
all  shares of common stock repurchased were retired or were in the process of being retired as of september  as of september   we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of common stock pursuant to our repurchase program 
under the repurchase program  our board of directors is authorized to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
on november   we entered into an agreement  subject to certain contingencies  to sell the building in which our manufacturing operations are conducted for  after the sale of the building  we plan to lease a new facility to consolidate all our operations in a single location 
at september   we plan to finance our operating and capital needs principally with cash from sales  cash  cash equivalents  and related interest and existing capital resources  which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations in the near future 
however  should it be necessary  we believe we could borrow adequate funds at competitive rates and terms 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the success in commercializing our existing products  development and commercialization of products in fields other than neurosurgery and the dental market  the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices  the status of regulatory approvals and competition 
we have a line of credit of  with first union national bank which calls for interest to be charged at the bank s national commercial rate 
the credit accommodation is unsecured and requires us to have a tangible net worth of no less than  at september   there was no outstanding balance on this line 
forward looking statements the information provided in this report may contain forward looking statements or statements which arguably imply or suggest certain things about our future 
statements which express that we believe  anticipate  expect  or plan to as well as other statements which are not historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to statements about any competitive advantage we may have as a result of our installed base of electrosurgical generators in the field of neurosurgery  our belief that our products exceed industry standards or favorably compete with other companies new technological advancements  the success of certain recently introduced products and disposable instrumentation and products in the field of neurosurgery and the dental market  and our ability to attract distributors for our products outside of neurosurgery and the dental market  and the acceptance of our products in those markets 
these statements are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable  but a number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements 
we do not intend to update these forward looking statements 
you are advised to review the additional cautionary statements section below for more information about risks that could affect the financial results of valley forge scientific 
additional cautionary statements we face intense competition the markets for our current and potential products are intensely competitive 
some surgical procedures which utilize or could utilize our products could potentially be replaced or reduced in importance by alternative medical procedures or new drugs which could render our products obsolete or uncompetitive in these markets 
our growth depends on introducing new products and the market penetration by third party distributors our growth depends on the acceptance of our products in the marketplace  the market penetration achieved by the companies which we sell to  and rely on  to distribute our products  and our ability to introduce new and innovative products that meet the needs of medical professionals 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to introduce new and innovative products or that the products we introduce  or have introduced  will be widely accepted by the marketplace  or that companies which we have contracted to distribute our products will continue to achieve market penetration in the field of neurosurgery and achieve market penetration in the dental market and surgical disciplines and markets outside of neurosurgery 
our failure to continue to introduce new products or gain wide spread acceptance of our products would adversely affect our operations 
we depend on attracting new distributors for our products in order to successfully commercialize our products in new markets  we will need to enter into distribution arrangements with companies who can distribute our products in those fields successfully 
the commercial success of our products outside the field of neurosurgery is thus uncertain 
our products are extensively regulated which could delay product introduction or halt sales the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
although we have not experienced any substantial regulatory delays to date  there is no assurance that delays will not occur in the future  which could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities to ascertain compliance with good manufacturing practices and can subject approved products to additional testing and surveillance programs 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and criminal penalties 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance  if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face uncertainty over reimbursement failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from health care payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
we may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property our ability to compete effectively depends in part on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our bipolar technology 
we cannot assure you that the patents we have obtained  or any patents we may obtain  will provide any competitive advantages for our products 
we also cannot assure you that those patents will not be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure you that competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  have not already applied for or obtained  or will not seek to apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
we may not be aware of all of the patents and patent applications potentially adverse to our interests 
we may become subject to a patent litigation the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of invention 
we may have product liability claims our products involve a risk of product liability claims 
although we maintain product liability insurance at coverage levels which we believe are adequate  there is no assurance that  if we were to incur substantial liability for product liability claims  insurance would provide adequate coverage against such liability 
our operating results may fluctuate we have experienced operating losses at various times since our inception  and only recently has our retained earnings reached  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on numerous factors including the following the introduction of new product lines  the level of market acceptance of our products  achievement of research and development milestones  timing of the receipt of orders and product shipments  timing of expenditures  increased penetration in existing applications  manufacturing or supply distributions  product returns  and receipt of necessary regulation approvals
