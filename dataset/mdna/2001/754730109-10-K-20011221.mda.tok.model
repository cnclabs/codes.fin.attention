however  during the first part of fiscal the company continued to add back office personnel in response to the record transaction volumes of the previous years 
in addition  the company continued to recruit investment bankers and research analysts during a period of slower investment banking revenues and added employees in rj ltd

effective for fiscal  the company changed the relationship of incentive compensation and base pay for employees at the assistant vice president level and below  effectively shifting approximately million in compensation from incentive compensation to administrative expense 
in addition  due to the addition of several teams of people in both investment banking and asset management with guaranteed compensation levels  incentive compensation did not decline ratably with income 
the company s contributions to qualified retirement plans and long term incentive plans did vary proportionately to pretax income in both and the increase in communications and information processing during fiscal was attributable almost entirely to the addition of rj ltd 
while costs associated with overall growth continued to affect communications and information processing expense during fiscal  there were also some significant individual items such as yk testing and the development of the former roney headquarters in detroit as a second processing center 
fiscal included costs associated with the integration of roney  preparation for yk and the merger creating rjfs 
the increases in communications and information processing expense in all three fiscal years include the costs of further enhancement and expansion of the company s systems of internal communication and information dissemination

management of these risks is critical to the company s soundness and profitability 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets

the principal risks involved in its business activities are market  credit  operational and legal 
market risk the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by the company is referred to as market risk 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management procedures extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
the company trades tax exempt and taxable debt obligations  including us treasury bills  notes  and bonds  us government agency and municipal notes and bonds  bank certificates of deposit  mortgage backed securities  and corporate obligations

the company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to hedge its debt inventory  acts in a matched book dealer capacity in these instruments  and to hedge rjbank s loan portfolio against fluctuations in interest rates 
rj bank accounts for its swap activity under fas and monitors this activity by reviewing resulting net yields and spreads 
the company uses notional contract amounts and daily mark to markets among other methods to measure this derivative activity 
notional amounts are not included on the company s balance sheet as these contract amounts are not actually paid or received 
notional amounts allow the company to calculate the cash flows to be exchanged and are not necessarily indicative of overall market risk 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and from changes in the interest rates on its interest earning assets including client loans  stock borrow activities  investments  and inventories and its funding sources including client cash balances  stock lending activities  and bank borrowings  which finance these assets 
the collateral underlying financial instruments at the broker dealer is repriced daily  thus there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value 
interest rates on client balances and stock borrow and lending produce a positive spread to the company  with the rates generally fluctuating in parallel 
the company manages its inventory exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  hedging with offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
while a significant portion of the company s securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over in excess of several times per year 
the company uses interest rate sensitivity analysis to monitor its exposure in the rjbank portfolio

the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty  monitoring trading counterparties  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance

the company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions  extends large loans to  or has large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers ie in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreement to resell represent approximately of the company s total assets and consist of securities issued by the us government 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are both with a large number of clients and counterparties and any potential concentration is carefully monitored 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses
