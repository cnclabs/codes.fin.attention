item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we derive our revenues from the license of our software products and from services we provide to our customers 
our license revenue is generated from one time and annual licenses and royalty arrangements with corporate  government  and oem customers and channel partners 
our service revenues consist of professional services and software maintenance fees associated with the license of our software products 
since the divestiture of our non core assets  which was completed in july  we derive virtually all of our license revenues from licenses of engenda and dynabase 
revenues from license agreements generally consist of a one time product license fee based on the number of individual users or contributors and the amount of content being managed 
for each license agreement  an annual software maintenance fee is calculated based upon a percentage of the applicable license fee 
payment of the maintenance fee permits customers to receive updates and enhancements to the software licensed for the duration of the maintenance agreement 
royalty revenues of the ied business were earned in one of the following ways as a percentage of net revenues from product unit sales by licensees that incorporate our products  as a fixed per unit royalty  or as a regular periodic fee based on estimated shipments or usage over time 
professional service fees may include fees for training  installation  consulting  implementation support  software design and or development  and  for the ied business  customization or modification of licensed software 
service fees are charged based on time and materials or on a fixed fee basis  and are recognized when the service has been provided 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers outside the united states 
such revenues totaled  and of total net revenue for the years ended january  and and december   respectively 
we expect that the international market will continue to account for a significant portion of our total business 
we generally denominate the prices for our corporate and end user products sold internationally in us dollars 
therefore  we believe that we are not exposed to significant risk with respect to changing currency exchange rates in connection with our business with international customers 
business conducted with overseas end users may be subject to greater currency exchange rate risk in the future see risk factors that may affect future operating results 
cost of revenues primarily is comprised of the amortization of capitalized product development costs and certain assets from acquisitions and license agreements described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  royalty expense for the licensing of technology  fulfillment  and service and support costs 
the level of amortization expense of capitalized product development costs is directly related to the amount of product development costs capitalized in each year and the time frame in which a specific product is made available for general release to customers 
in july  we completed the divestiture of certain assets  which was originally announced in april between october and july  we divested our former product data management pdm division including our dynatext dynaweb technical document publishing technology and viewport browser technology  our information exchange division ied and our mediabank product line mediabank 
our ongoing operations are comprised of our family of web content management technologies and related services  and are run under the name ebusiness technologies ebt 
mediabank was previously a component of the ebt division 
all references to ebt in this narrative exclude the mediabank results 
references to disposed businesses include the pdm division  ied and mediabank 
as a result of the divestitures that have taken place in fiscal and  and the restructuring that took place in the first quarter of fiscal  the corporate function has been substantially reduced and absorbed into the operations of ebt 
accordingly  effective with the decision in the second quarter of fiscal to operate under this new structure  the corporate costs are more directly related to the operations solely of the company 
beginning in the second half of fiscal  we have only one operating segment 
prior to the second half of fiscal  we had several operating segments  and the company was structured differently to accommodate this diversity 
consequently  certain corporate costs  which have historically been excluded from our divisional and segment discussions in this section  are now included in the ebt results in all of the discussion presented below  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  when the boston corporate offices were closed 
due to the significant changes that have taken place in the company since july  we believe that attempts to allocate a portion of the prior year corporate related expenses among the segments is not meaningful  and therefore  no such allocations have been included in the discussion presented below for any periods prior to the second quarter of fiscal the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues 
percentage of revenues years ended january  year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses sales and marketing product development amortization of intangible assets general and administrative restructuring expenses special charges purchased in process research and development total operating expenses operating loss net investment income recovery write down of investment in information please llc gain on sale of assets income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended january  compared to year ended january  company wide revenues totaled  for the year ended january   a decline of  from the  company wide total reported in the prior year 
excluding revenues of the disposed businesses  ebt revenues  totaled  for the year ended january   an increase of  or  over the prior year total of  this increase in total revenues is a result of a growth in service revenue  offset by a decrease in product revenue 
the decrease in product revenue reflects the impact of the current year product transition to the newly released engenda tm product  and also reflects training and ramp up time to transition our sales force to a solution selling approach 
as product sales have historically led service revenue  the company may experience slower growth in its service revenue in the near future as a result of the lower levels of product sales in the current year 
the balance of the change in total revenues relates to revenues for the disposed product data management pdm  mediabank and information exchange division ied businesses  which were a combined  in fiscal  a decline of  from the  reported in fiscal fiscal revenues for these businesses included nearly one full year of revenues  while there were no pdm revenues in fiscal  and slightly less than one half year s revenues for mediabank and ied 
pdm was sold in january  mediabank was sold in june  and ied was sold in july company wide gross profit was  for the year ended january   a decrease of  from the fiscal company wide gross profit of  excluding the gross profit of the disposed businesses  ebt gross profit was  for the year ended january   a decrease of  or  from the comparable prior year total of  the decrease in ebt s gross profit reflects the increase in service revenues as a percentage of total revenue  and the impact of costs related to our expanding professional services organization  including the use of third party contractors 
since service revenues have lower margins than license revenues  growth in our service business will result in lower gross profit if our license revenues do not increase in the same period 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues  excluding the revenues and gross profit associated with the divested pdm and ied divisions  was for the year ended january   compared to for the year ended january  the remaining decline in gross profit is attributable to the disposed businesses  which reported gross profit of  for the year ended january   a decrease of  from  for the year ended january  again  this decline is related to the timing of the dispositions of these businesses  as the prior year results include nearly twelve months of results for all of these businesses  compared to no results for pdm in fiscal and slightly less than one half year s revenues for both mediabank and ied in fiscal year company wide total operating expenses were  for the year ended january   a decrease of  from the prior year total of  excluding operating expenses of the disposed businesses  ebt total operating expenses were  for the year ended january   an increase of  or  from  for the year ended january  this increase is primarily related to increases in sales and marketing positions  marketing programs and the corporate related expenses absorbed by ebt since the may closure of the company s former boston headquarters 
the increase in ebt operating expenses was more than offset by a decline in operating expenses attributable to the disposed businesses  and also to decreased corporate operating expenses  resulting from the restructuring actions taken from july to may total operating expenses relating to the disposed business and former corporate office were  for the year ended january   a decline of  or  from the  reported for the year ended january  of this decline   resulted from the disposed pdm division   from the disposition of ied and  from the disposed mediabank product line 
the balance of the decline was attributable to the closure of the boston office and to cost savings generated from the restructuring actions taken since july included in total operating expenses for the year ended january  were net restructuring expenses and special charges of  these charges consisted primarily of severance costs related to both the may relocation of our corporate offices to providence  rhode island and the january workforce reduction 
included in total operating expenses for the year ended january  were special charges of  and restructuring expenses of  the special charges include expenses for costs relating to the restatement of our financial results and the associated sec investigation  costs relating to the write down of intangible assets and capitalized software costs  substantially all attributable to the pdm division and net premium costs and related expenses for a major insurance carrier to assume financial risk associated with the class action litigation initiated against us in february see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring expenses included costs relating to the april and july charges in connection with the implementation of our new divisional structure see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and our october restructuring of the pdm division 
additionally  the operating expenses for the year ended january  were reduced by a credit of  to sales and marketing expenses for the termination of a international distributor agreement  for which an accrual of  was recorded in the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and bonuses for sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenses 
company wide sales and marketing expenses totaled  for the year ended january   a decline of  from the  reported in the year ended january  excluding expenses of the disposed businesses  ebt sales and marketing expenses increased  to  for the year ended january   primarily due to our continued investment in growing the ebt business 
this growth is evidenced primarily through expanded marketing campaigns and increases in sales and sales related personnel and associated recruiting costs 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in certain incentive related compensation costs as a result of the lower sales in the current year 
the remaining change in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to decreases in expenses of the disposed businesses 
sales and marketing expenses of the disposed businesses decreased  to  for the year ended january   compared to  for the year ended january  the dispositions of pdm  ied and mediabank accounted for decreases of   and  respectively 
the balance of the decrease in sales and marketing expenses relates to the cost savings resulting from the restructuring actions taken in fiscal product development costs consist primarily of personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  fees paid for outside software development and consulting services 
company wide product development expenses totaled  for the year ended january   a decline of  from the  reported in the year ended january  excluding expenses of the disposed businesses  ebt product development expenses increased  to  for the year ended january  additional costs associated with increased headcount to support new product development initiatives were nearly offset by decreases in outside contractor fees  resulting from the company s effort to decrease reliance on outside contractors  and decreases in certain incentive related compensation costs 
the remaining  decrease in product development expenses is attributable to the decreased expenses of the disposed businesses  combined with cost savings generated through the restructuring actions taken since july the dispositions of pdm  ied and mediabank accounted for decreases of   and  respectively 
the balance of the decrease in product development expenses relates to the costs savings generated by the restructuring actions taken in fiscal amortization of intangible assets decreased  to  for the year ended january  from  for the year ended january  due to the fiscal and divestitures 
all of the intangible assets that were being amortized related to businesses that were divested in fiscal and company wide general and administrative expenses totaled  for the year ended january   a decrease of  from the  reported in the prior year 
ebt general and administrative expenses increased  to  for the year ended january   primarily as a result of the inclusion of certain expenses formerly considered corporate unallocated expenses prior to the second quarter of fiscal the prior year presentation has not been restated to reflect an allocation of corporate expenses  as the structure of the company was so different at that time that we believe such an allocation would not be meaningful 
the remaining  decline in total general and administrative expenses is largely attributable to the january  june and july dispositions of businesses 
general and administrative expenses of the disposed businesses decreased to  for the year ended january   compared to  for the year ended january  the dispositions of pdm  ied and mediabank accounted for decreases of   and  respectively 
the remaining decrease in general and administrative expenses is attributable to the cost savings generated through the restructuring actions taken in fiscal and the restructuring charges reported in the fiscal year ended january  relate primarily to the april restructuring plan  under which we began to focus our energies on ebt s web content management and workflow product line and related services  and pursue divestiture of certain assets  including ied 
the plan included the consolidation of our boston headquarters into the providence  rhode island offices of the ebt division 
in connection with this reorganization  approximately administrative employees and four executive officers were terminated or resigned in april  may and june as a result of this plan  we recorded a net charge of  in the first quarter of fiscal year ending january  the charge was comprised primarily of severance for those employees 
this restructuring action was estimated to generate annualized cost savings of approximately million from the level of expenses incurred at the time of the restructuring 
at january    of this charge remains unpaid and the balance is expected to be paid in full during fiscal on january   the company adopted a plan of restructuring aimed at reducing current operating cost 
in connection with this plan  non management employees  primarily development and administrative positions  and one executive level employee were terminated 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a charge of  for severance costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  all of which remains unpaid at january  annualized savings from the elimination of these positions  primarily in development and administrative functions in the providence headquarters  are estimated to approximate million 
the development and administrative cost savings from this action are expected to be offset by increases in sales related costs to be incurred over the course of the year  as the company completes its restructuring plan through increased sales staffing 
net credit adjustments of approximately  were recorded in fiscal  related to the fiscal restructuring initiatives described below 
these adjustments were to reduce accrued amounts to reflect estimated remaining balances to be paid out  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements

acquired in process research and development the company s january and calendar year acquisitions included purchased in process research and development charges for venture labs  inc  sherpa systems corporation  and mediabank totaling  these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and therefore had no alternative future uses

the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities necessary to establish that each product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements

the projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value using the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise 
the company no longer employs any of this technology in its operations  as all of the technology acquired in connection with the and business acquisitions has been sold through the various sale transactions of dynatext  pdm  ied and mediabank see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates used in valuing the in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
the assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variances may adversely affect the sales and profitability of future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets recorded at the time of the respective acquisitions may become impaired 
ais software sa the primary purchased in process technology acquired in the ais acquisition was the dualprism web distribution technology 
this is a flexible server based publishing technology that allows data stored in a number of possible repositories  file systems  relational databases and object databases  to be served dynamically to a standard world wide web browser 
the company estimates that this project was completed at the time of the acquisition 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products was substantially completed during fiscal  and ais software sa was subsequently sold as part of the january disposition of the pdm division 
venture labs  inc the primary purchased in process technologies acquired in the venture labs  inc acquisition consisted of the java filtering and viewing projects 
the company estimates that the projects were between and complete at the date of the venture labs  inc acquisition 
as of january   the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products was substantially completed  and venture labs  inc and its subsidiary paradigm development corporation collectively paradigm were subsequently sold as part of the july divesture of the company s information exchange division 
sherpa systems corporation the primary purchased in process technology acquired in the sherpa systems corporation acquisition was the sherpaworks version product 
this technology was designed to implement a three tier architecture  to provide out of the box  configurable product data management systems 
the company estimated that this project was approximately complete at the date of the sherpa acquisition 
the company stopped development of sherpaworks in the third quarter of fiscal  given management s plans to divest of the pdm division  and sherpa systems corporation was subsequently sold as part of the january disposition of the pdm division 
mediabank the primary purchased in process technologies acquired in the mediabank acquisition consisted of the new digital asset management products  which were divided into two projects 
the first project was a media asset management technology that provides support for standard query language sql databases  such as oracle and microsoft s sql server 
in addition  this project also provides server capabilities that allow users to manage and retrieve assets stored in the asset management systems through a standard web browser 
the company estimates that this project was complete at the time of the mediabank acquisition 
as of january   the nature of the efforts required to develop the first project into commercially viable products was substantially completed 
the second project provided content management capabilities based on the contents of text embedded in popular text formats stored in the database 
in addition  the second project provides support for db  a popular relational database developed by ibm  and ibm s content manager formerly digital library product 
the company estimates that this project was complete at the time of the mediabank acquisition 
as of january   the nature of the efforts required to develop this project into commercially viable products was substantially completed 
risk factors that may affect future operating results we intend to substantially increase ebt s sales and marketing organization 
this could burden our level of sales and marketing expenditures relative to revenues  which could lower our operating margins in future periods 
our ability to remain competitive in the computer software industry depends on the services of a number of key management and technical personnel  principally software engineers 
personnel costs for technical staff represent a significant portion of our operating expenses  and increased competition and related personnel cost increases for such staff could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  because of the drop in ebt s stock price we may need to use larger amounts of cash to compensate our employees  rather than the equity incentives we have relied on in prior periods 
this could result in reduced operating margins as a result of higher personnel costs 
the market for enterprise content management is fiercely competitive  and is currently dominated by companies such as interwoven  vignette  and documentum  which have substantially greater development  marketing  sales and financial resources than we do 
in addition  there are numerous smaller providers of content management  both public and privately funded  which pose competitive challenges 
while we believe that products are selected today on the basis of feature  ease of use  use of open standards  scalability and flexibility  and not on the basis of price  there is risk that this competitive environment may begin to put downward pressure on price for our products 
moreover  our inability to differentiate our products effectively  to enter into strategic relationships with consulting and other partners to drive customer acquisition  or a failure to successfully market our solution would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have invested significant development resources in products utilizing standards based publishing formats  such as xml  and we intend to invest significant resources in technologies and standards for the mobile and wireless market 
should large numbers of customers and potential customers not ultimately adopt such formats and standards  it is possible that there may be a limited market for the products we are currently developing  which could have an adverse impact on future revenues and operating results 
we have invested substantial resources developing a new product  entrepid  which provides content management for customers who have elected to use the oracle database as their repository for web content 
therefore  the success of this product will be tied in part to the continued acceptance of oracle as a leading database technology provider 
failure of oracle to continue to win substantial market share for its database products would likely cause a material adverse effect on our ability to sell entrepid 
moreover  should oracle develop or acquire its own competing content management and workflow product  our ability to sell entrepid could be materially adversely affected 
even if oracle continues to be a market leader in enterprise database technology and does not begin to sell a product with substantially similar functionality to entrepid  there can be no assurance that we will achieve sufficient market acceptance of entrepid to achieve a return on our development investment 
failure to achieve market acceptance for entrepid would likely have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as we have shifted from being a technology platform provider to offering a solution  we have retrained and have substantially changed the make up of our sales force 
the average tenure of our sales personnel is less than six months 
we have made substantial investments in training this new sales force 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in making this sales force productive and in successfully transitioning to a solution selling approach 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we intend to increase the marketing of our products directly to customers outside the united states 
the marketing of products directly to customers outside the united states increases the risk to our revenues associated with fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies 
such fluctuations could also result in increased operating expenses associated with foreign operations 
our business could be harmed if the growth of the internet does not continue 
to the extent that businesses do not continue to adopt the internet as critical to their future plans  we may experience difficulty expanding our customer base 
further  the growth of the internet as a medium for business requires the acceptance and adoption of new paradigms for operating traditional businesses  and we cannot be certain that this will occur as rapidly or completely as we hope 
many companies have already invested substantial resources in other means of conducting commerce and exchanging information  and they may be unwilling to quickly move to internet based strategies to achieve these objectives 
even with substantial internet growth  it is possible that the existing and future internet infrastructure may not be able to support the additional demands placed upon it 
this could lead to delays in implementation of internet based technologies  including those we market 
future legislation or regulations could be enacted that directly or indirectly impact our ability to market our products  especially in the area of internet commerce 
it is impossible to predict if or how any future legislation or regulations would impact the internet and our business 
however  legislation or regulation that discouraged continued investment in internet commerce could slow demand for content management products  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ebt is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
our cash equivalents and available for sale investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments 
we manage the exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio and investing in short term investment grade corporate securities  united states agency bonds  and asset backed securities 
in addition  we do not use investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates 
as of january   the analysis indicated that the change in interest income would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
additionally  the carrying value of our investments approximates the fair value and therefore the impact of a fluctuation in interest rates to the carrying value is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
however  actual interest income and gains and losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries  and therefore are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we primarily license our technology in us dollars but certain operating expenses are denominated in the local currency 
for fiscal  we do not believe we had significant exposure associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will evaluate the exposures going forward and will implement the appropriate risk management procedures as deemed necessary
