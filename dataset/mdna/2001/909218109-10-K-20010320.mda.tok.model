item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity on march   we completed the acquisition  by merger  of questa oil and gas co 
questa under which questa became a wholly owned subsidiary of unit corporation 
in the merger  each of questa s outstanding shares of common stock excluding treasury shares was converted into 
shares of our common stock 
we issued approximately million shares as a result of this merger 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  all amounts within this document have been restated  unless otherwise noted  as if the companies had been combined during the periods presented 
our bank loan agreement provides for a total loan facility of million 
each year on april and october our banks redetermine our available borrowing value 
this value is primarily determined by an amount equal to a percentage of the discounted future value of our oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by the banks 
an additional amount  limited to million  is added to the borrowing value for a percentage of the value of a portion of our drilling rig fleet 
our loan agreement provides for a revolving credit facility which terminates on may  followed by a three year term loan 
borrowings under our loan agreement totaled million at december  and million at february  the latest borrowing value computation determined the full amount of the loan facility could be available to us  however  in order to reduce cost  we elected to set the borrowing value at million for the current borrowing value period 
we are charged a facility fee of 
of percent on any unused portion of the available borrowing value 
the loan agreement also contains covenants which require us to maintain 
consolidated tangible net worth of at least million  
a current ratio of not less than to  
a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to  
a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to  and 
working capital provided by operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
the interest rate on our bank debt was percent at december  and percent at february  at our election  any portion of our outstanding bank debt may be fixed at the london interbank offered rate libor rate  as adjusted  depending on the level of our debt as a percentage of the available borrowing value 
the libor rate may be fixed for periods of up to   or days with the remainder of our bank debt being subject to the chase manhattan bank  n 
a 
prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period  we may not pay any part of the outstanding principal balance which is subject to the libor rate 
borrowings subject to the libor rate were million at december  and million at february  our shareholders equity at december  was million giving us a ratio of long term debt to total capitalization of percent 
our primary source of funds consists of the cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our bank loan agreement 
net cash provided by our operations in was million compared to million in we had working capital of million at december  our total capital expenditures were million  of which million was spent in our oil and natural gas operations 
this segment s capital expenditures consisted primarily of million for exploration and development drilling and million for producing property acquisitions 
capital expenditures for our contract drilling operations totaled and consisted primarily of million to rebuild three of our drilling rigs  million to acquire one rig and million to start construction on two additional rigs 
we also acquired million in new drill pipe with the remainder of our drilling capital expenditures for major components for our rig fleet 
we anticipate that we will spend approximately million in for drilling rig equipment 
as natural gas and oil prices increased during the last six months of and throughout  we increased the drilling activity in our exploration and production operation with the result that we drilled wells during as compared to a total of wells during the if oil and natural gas prices remain favorable  we plan to drill an estimated wells and spend approximately million drilling or buying oil and natural gas properties in most of our capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward our future growth 
current operations do not depend on our ability to obtain funds outside of our loan agreement and our anticipated cash flow 
future decisions by us to acquire or drill on oil and natural gas properties will depend on prevailing or anticipated market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and the availability of opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved  thus providing us with a large degree of flexibility in determining when and if to incur such costs 
on september   we completed the acquisition of land drilling rigs from parker drilling company and parker drilling company north america  inc  for  shares of our common stock and  in cash 
the cash part of this acquisition was funded through a public offering of  shares of our common stock which closed on september  we received proceeds of million from the offering net of commission fees and other costs 
on november   we acquired hickman drilling company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger entered into by and between us  hickman drilling company and all of the holders of the outstanding capital stock of hickman drilling company 
as part of this acquisition  the former shareholders of hickman held  as of december   promissory notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of million 
these notes are payable in equal annual installments on january  through january  the notes bear interest at the chase prime rate which at december  was percent and february  was percent 
at february   the promissory notes outstanding totaled million 
due to a settlement agreement which terminated at december   we have a liability of  at december   representing proceeds received from a natural gas purchaser as prepayment for natural gas 
the  is payable in equal annual payments on june  and june  the average price we received for our oil in increased percent from the price we received in and our december oil price was percent higher than the oil price we received in december natural gas prices remain volatile  but increased substantially during the year 
our average natural gas price in was percent higher than our average price and our december natural gas price was percent higher than our december price 
for the year  the average natural gas price we received was per mcf and the average oil price we received was per barrel 
natural gas prices are influenced by weather conditions and supply imbalances  particularly in the domestic market  and by world wide oil price levels 
domestic oil price levels continue to be primarily influenced by world market developments 
since natural gas comprises approximately percent of our total oil and natural gas reserves  natural gas prices have a significant effect on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves and large natural gas price declines could cause us to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
any price decreases  if sustained  would also adversely affect our future cash flow by reducing our oil and natural gas revenues and  if continued over an extended period  could lessen not only the demand for our contract drilling rigs but also the rate we would receive 
any declines in natural gas and oil prices could also adversely affect the semi annual determination of the loan value under our bank loan agreement since this determination is based on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves and our drilling rigs 
such a reduction would reduce the amount available to us under our loan agreement which  in turn  may affect our ability to carry out our capital projects 
generally  during the past years  our contract drilling operations have encountered significant competition  as reduced oil and natural gas prices during most of the period created a reduction in the demand for domestic land contract drilling rigs 
however  in the last half of and throughout as oil and natural gas prices increased we experienced a substantial increase in demand for our rigs bringing our utilization rates above percent for the last five months of even with the increase in demand  we anticipate that competition within our industry will  for the foreseeable future  continue to influence the use of our drilling rigs 
in addition to competition  our ability to use our drilling rigs at any given time depends on a number of other factors  including the continued strengthening of the price of both oil and natural gas  the availability of labor and our ability to supply the type of equipment required 
at december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  the benefit of which has been recognized in our financial statements as we believe it to be more likely than not that we will use these nol s 
should we be unable to generate sufficient income in future years to allow the use of all the nol s  a charge to expense will be required to give recognition to any loss of the nol s 
at december   one of our subsidiaries owned  shares of common stock and  warrants in shenandoah resources ltd  which is a canadian oil and natural gas exploration and production company 
the investment of  is part of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
effects of inflation in the previous years the effects of inflation on our operations have been minimal due to low inflation rates and moderate demand for contract drilling services 
in the last half of and throughout  as drilling rig day rates and drilling rig utilization increased  the impact of inflation has increased as the availability of equipment and third party services have decreased 
due to industry wide demand for qualified labor  contract drilling labor cost increased substantially in the summer of how inflation will effect us in the future will depend on additional increases  if any  we realize in our drilling rig rates and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas 
if industry activity continues to increase  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor could occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in our material and labor costs 
these conditions may limit our ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
new accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
the statement has subsequently been amended by fasb statements no 
and no 
and establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
we will be required to adopt this statement in the first quarter of this statement will require us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure the effectiveness of the hedges  or the degree that the gain loss for the hedging instrument offsets the loss gain on the hedged item  at fair value for each reporting period 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument will be recognized in other comprehensive income as a component of our equity until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative s change in fair value is required to be recognized in earnings during the period the change in value occurs 
we have evaluated all of our transactions that could potentially be classified as derivative instruments under fas the adoption of fas will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
results of operations versus net income for was  compared with  for this increase resulted primarily from increases in our natural gas and oil prices and production volumes 
higher oil and natural gas prices also elevated the demand for our drilling rigs  resulting in increased utilization of our rigs  dayrates and net income 
our oil and natural gas revenues increased percent in due to a percent and percent rise in the average prices we received for natural gas and oil  respectively 
for the year  natural gas production increased by percent and oil production increased by percent when compared to production grew as we drilled gross wells net wells in  compared to gross wells net wells in natural gas production for the fourth quarter of exceeded s fourth quarter production by percent 
in  revenues from our contract drilling operations increased by percent as the average number of our drilling rigs being used increased from in to in revenues per rig per day increased percent between the comparative years 
the acquisition of the parker drilling rigs added rigs to our utilization rate in the fourth quarter of and rigs to our utilization at dayrates substantially higher than those achieved in our other marketing area 
our rigs excluding those acquired from parker added rigs to utilization and added an additional percent to their revenue per rig per day 
daywork revenues represented percent of our total drilling revenues in and percent in operating margins revenues less operating costs for our oil and natural gas operations were percent in and percent in this increase resulted primarily from the increase in the average oil and natural gas prices we received 
total operating costs between the comparative years increased percent due primarily to the percent increase in production taxes incurred as a result of higher revenues and to a lesser extent from the addition of new wells through development drilling 
our contract drilling operating margins increased from percent in to percent in the additional operating margin was generally due to additional revenue received per day and an increase in the number of rigs utilized 
our contract drilling operating cost per rig per day increased in as total contract drilling operating costs were up percent in versus primarily due to increased utilization 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent due to the impact of higher depreciation per operating day associated with the newly acquired parker rigs and an overall increase in our rig utilization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our oil and natural gas properties increased percent due to additional production volumes 
the average dd a rate per mcfe decreased percent to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs  outside contract services and office expenses increased due to the growth in both of our operating segments 
interest expense decreased percent as our average outstanding debt decreased percent during the average interest rate increased from percent in to percent in on may   our contract drilling offices in moore  oklahoma were struck by a tornado destroying two buildings and damaging various vehicles and drilling equipment 
in may  we received  of insurance proceeds for the destroyed buildings  and  as a result  in the second quarter of  we recognized a gain of  recorded as part of other revenues 
during the first quarter of  we received the final insurance proceeds totaling  for the contents of the destroyed buildings  damaged equipment and clean up costs 
from these proceeds  we recognized a gain of  recorded as part of other revenues in the first quarter of versus net income for was  compared with  in lower natural gas and oil prices in the first half of reduced both the demand for our drilling rigs and the rates we received for the drilling rigs that were operating 
as a result of the merger with questa  the oil and gas properties of questa were restated from the successful efforts method of accounting to the full cost method of accounting used by unit corporation 
as part of this restatement  in  the value of questa s oil and natural gas properties were impaired due to low prices at the end of the third quarter of  therefore  the questa properties were written down million 
our oil and natural gas revenues increased percent in due to a percent and percent increase in the average prices we received for natural gas and oil  respectively 
for the year  natural gas production decreased by percent and oil production decreased by percent when compared to our oil production declined because we in recent years emphasized the drilling of development wells aimed at replacing and increasing our natural gas reserves 
our natural gas production decreased because we curtailed our development drilling program during the first half of while oil and natural gas prices were depressed 
as prices began to improve during the last six months of  our natural gas production increased as we increased our drilling program 
natural gas production for the fourth quarter of exceeded s fourth quarter production by percent 
in  revenues from our contract drilling operations increased by percent as the average number of drilling rigs being used increased from in to in revenues per rig per day increased percent between the comparative years 
during the first nine months of as compared to the same period of  our average drilling rig utilization was down percent and our average revenues per rig per day was down percent 
the acquisition of the parker drilling rigs added rigs to our utilization rate in the fourth quarter of at dayrates substantially higher than those achieved in our other marketing area 
as a result  that acquisition had a strong impact on our contract drilling fourth quarter and year end operating results  adding million in revenues 
daywork revenues represented percent of our total drilling revenues in and percent in operating margins revenues less operating costs for our oil and natural gas operations were percent in and percent in this increase resulted primarily from the increase in the average oil and natural gas prices we received and a percent decrease in operating costs between the comparative years 
our contract drilling operating margins decreased from percent in to percent in this reduction was generally due to decreases during the first nine months of in both daily drilling rig revenue rates and utilization and increases in operating costs 
total contract drilling operating costs were up percent in versus due to increased labor costs and related benefit costs  including workers compensation 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent due to the impact of higher depreciation per operating day associated with the newly acquired parker rigs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our oil and natural gas properties decreased percent 
total dd a was higher in due to the write down of questa s oil and natural gas properties in the third quarter of  as discussed above 
decreases in production as previously discussed also reduced dd a in the average dd a rate per mcfe increased percent to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee benefit costs and outside services increased 
interest expense increased percent as our average outstanding debt increased percent during the average interest rate decreased from percent in to percent in on may   our contract drilling offices in moore  oklahoma were struck by a tornado destroying two buildings and damaging various vehicles and drilling equipment 
in may  we received  of insurance proceeds for the destroyed buildings  and as a result  in the second quarter of  we recognized a gain of  recorded as part of other revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing of our oil and natural gas production 
the price we receive is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and market prices applicable to our natural gas production 
historically  prices we have received for our oil and natural gas production have been volatile and such volatility is expected to continue 
to reduce the impact of price fluctuations  we periodically use hedging strategies to hedge the price we will receive for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production 
in the first quarter of  we entered into swap transactions in an effort to lock in a portion of our production at the higher oil prices which currently existed 
these transactions applied to approximately percent of our daily oil production covering the period from april  to july  and percent of our daily oil production for august and september of  at prices ranging from to 
we have also entered into a collar contract for approximately percent of our daily production for the period covering november  to february  the collar has a floor of and a ceiling of and we are receiving per barrel for entering into the collar transaction 
during  the sum of these hedging transactions yielded a reduction in our oil revenues of  interest rate risk our interest rate exposure relates to our long term debt  all of which bears interest at variable rates based on the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor rate 
at our election  borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan may be fixed at the libor rate for periods up to days 
historically  we have not utilized any financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to attempt to manage the exposure to increases in interest rates 
however  we may consider the use of such financial instruments in the future based on our assessment of future interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow before taxes of a one percent change in the floating rate based on our average outstanding long term debt in would have been approximately
