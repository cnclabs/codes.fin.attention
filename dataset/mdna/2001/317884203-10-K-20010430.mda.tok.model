the company had  at october  the company s tax year end  a nol for tax purposes of approximately million which is subject to an annual limit of approximately million per year 
however  for financial reporting purposes  no nol exists as of february  from time to time  finlay enters into futures contracts  such as options or forwards  based upon the anticipated sales of gold product in order to hedge against the risk arising from its payment arrangements

no assurances  however  can be given that finlay jewelry s current level of operating results will continue or improve or that finlay jewelry s income from operations will continue to be sufficient to permit finlay jewelry and the company to meet their debt service and other obligations
