the company typically bills contracts monthly  and senior management reviews outstanding accounts receivable balances regularly to monitor client satisfaction and collections

in addition to service contracts  during  the company expanded its offerings to include training based products 
although this is not currently a significant source of revenue  the company expects to offer a variety of training based products across all segments in the future 
gross profit margins per project and professional staff utilization rates are critical to the company s financial performance 
the company manages these parameters by carefully establishing and monitoring project budgets and timetables and by closely tracking staffing requirements for projects in progress and projects that are anticipated 
the status of all projects in progress and personnel utilization are reviewed semi monthly by project managers  first line supervisors  and senior management to ensure client satisfaction and to monitor performance relative to internal financial and operating expectations 
the number of professionals assigned to a project varies according to the size  complexity  duration  and demands of the project 
professional staff utilization rates vary from period to period not only because of variations in the company s volume of business  but because of the timing of employee vacations  hiring and training  the amount of time spent by employees on marketing  and project terminations or postponements 
business in grew sequentially quarter on quarter from the reduced volume experienced in before flattening out in the fourth quarter due to reduced information technology it and training expenditures by businesses in general

this resulted primarily from reduced staff utilization due to declining demand for it and enterprise resource planning erp services in the second half of the year 
in addition  quarterly revenue growth and margins are substantially dependent on many factors which are outside of the company s control  including the timing of new contract awards  the timing of individual project start ups  and the level of activity with ongoing projects 
client engagements are generally terminable with little or no notice or penalty  and a client s unanticipated decision to terminate or postpone a project may result in revenue fluctuations as well as higher than expected unassigned company professionals or severance expenses 
the principal components of cost of services are compensation and benefits to the company s professional staff 
cost of services also includes training and travel expenses for the company s professional staff  fees paid to subcontractors  facilities costs  and depreciation of capital equipment provided to the professional staff 
time devoted to marketing by professional personnel normally assigned to client work is included in cost of services  as are costs associated with administrative personnel who directly support the company s professional staff

as a result of this reorganization  the company has changed its discussion of operating results from the four segments previously discussed to the present three segments 
solutions delivered by the company often can be associated with more than one of the three identified business segments 
for example  solutions delivered outside of the latitude segment  such as in erp  frequently have significant it components  such as electronic information delivery  web based documentation  on line help and knowledge management systems  packaged software implementation and configuration  and electronic performance support 
the company s ability to deliver integrated solutions that leverage the full breadth of its expertise in such areas as it  end user support  performance analysis  and documentation is a significant differentiator and competitive advantage 
during  the company changed the way it reports gross profit margins 
the company previously included all selling expenses with cost of services and now includes these expenses with selling  general and administrative expenses except for time devoted to marketing by professional personnel normally assigned to client work 
those costs remain in cost of services

business risks certain statements contained herein  including statements regarding development of the company s services  markets and future demand for the company s services  and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
these forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties 
consequently  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the following are some of the factors that may cause the company s actual future results of operations to differ materially from management s expectations and historic trends 

strategic alliances 
the company s relationships with its strategic allies  particularly sap and siebel  as well as documentum  lotus  point  dataware  microsoft  saba  wbt systems  centra software  o reilly and associates  experient technologies  sas institute  and netscape have been  or are anticipated to be  important sources of revenue 
the company also faces potential competition from software companies  including its strategic allies who  through their client services groups  may choose to compete with the company 
many of these alliances are informal or terminable by either party with minimal notice 
the termination of  or any adverse change in any of these alliances  particularly sap or siebel  could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its revenue and profitability goals 

geographic expansion 
the company continues to expand its operations and marketing efforts in europe  mexico  and asia  including establishing offices and expatriating employees  thereby incurring significant operating costs 
if these efforts fail to produce revenue at expected levels or within the timeframe predicted by management  operating margins in would be adversely affected 
international operations present a number of risks  such as adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  cultural differences  and possible changes in taxes  laws  and policies governing the operations of foreign based companies 
the company has no control over these factors  any of which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and demand for its services abroad 

enterprise systems 
in  sales and services relating to erp software rebounded from the slowdown that the major software vendors experienced in as it spending focus returned to business improvements 
as a result of improved market conditions and the company s emphasis on strategic alliances  the company expects that in  its erp service sector will improve its financial performance 
however  the actual demand for erp services remains difficult to forecast 

rapidly changing information technology sector 
the information technology industry is subject to significant and rapid changes in technology and the demand for particular products and services 
recent examples include the shift in demand away from custom software development in favor of ecommerce and web based solutions 
if the company fails to identify shifting demand for particular information technology services or does not develop the expertise necessary to provide services for which there is new demand  the company s revenue growth and profitability are likely to be adversely affected 
during the second half of  revenues for the company s information technology services declined primarily because clients delayed or canceled several projects as a result of their concerns about their yk mitigation efforts 
in  business stabilized due to a stronger market and the company s alliances with key companies  although some slowing in it spending was experienced toward the end of the year 
the company cannot be certain that it will experience continued growth in demand for these services 

customer and industry revenue concentration 
the company continues to derive a substantial amount of its revenue from a limited number of key clients 
in  the company s top five clients and ten clients represented percent and percent of total revenue  respectively  with clients in the automotive industry generating percent of total revenue 
most of the company s engagements have no minimum purchase requirements and may be terminated by the client with little or no notice to the company 
many of these clients operate in cyclical industries  such as automotive and petrochemicals  which are subject to economic factors that affect the clients revenue and profitability 
automotive industry sales are expected to be down in while the company anticipates less work in with its key automobile manufacturing clients  manufacturing performance has several initiatives in other business areas within and outside the automotive industry 
if any of the company s major clients discontinue doing business with the company or significantly reduce the amount of services they purchase from the company  the company s revenue growth and profitability are likely to be adversely affected 

attracting and retaining personnel 
as is the case with most technology companies  the company experiences significant turnover in its technical staff 
the company s growth will continue to depend on its ability to attract  develop  and retain a sufficient number of skilled professional employees 
technically qualified personnel are in short supply  and there is intense competition for qualified people 
also  the company will need to ensure that its technical personnel keep current on rapid changes in technology 
the company s operating costs may be higher than management expects if competition for qualified people increases and the company experiences higher turnover levels

john h 
beakes  co founder of the company  retired as president and chief operating officer 
mr 
kenneth j 
rebeck  who has significant senior management experience at the company  was appointed president and chief operating officer 

increasing competition 
in recent years  the company has experienced heightened competition  particularly in the erp  esolutions  and elearning areas of its business 
if competition continues to intensify  the company may find it more difficult to grow its revenue at rates comparable to historic growth rates and to maintain its profit margins at historic levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not have significant interest rate risk related to its line of credit  which has an interest rate equivalent to the day libor rate percent on december   plus percent 
the company does not have significant foreign currency risk related to foreign sales because of the minimal amount of funds maintained in foreign payroll and operating accounts and since most non united states revenues are paid in us currency by us national firms 
the company does not have any derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments such as interest swaps  foreign currency forwards  futures and options  and foreign currency denominated debt 
the company does not have commodity price risk or other relevant market risks
