overview the company develops  manufactures and markets immunoassay based test kits for rapid and inexpensive detection of a wide variety of substances in the food safety and water quality markets 
through its strategic biosolutions division  the company also provides antibody and immunoreagent research and development production services 
since its inception  the company and its predecessors have  in addition to conducting internal research and development of new products  entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the food safety  water quality and other markets 
the company expects that internal research and development projects  primarily in the food safety area  will continue to represent a larger percentage of its research and development expenditures 
the company believes that its competitiveness has been enhanced through the combinations of talents  technology and resources resulting from the relationships and the acquisitions it concluded during the past four years 
these relationships and acquisitions have enabled the company to achieve meaningful economies of scale for the unique products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilites in newark  delaware  for the manufacture of test kits  antibodies and biochemicals  its facility located outside of san diego  california for the manufacture of antibodies and biochemicals and its facility located in windham  maine for the manufacture of custom  high volume bulk polyclonal antibodies 
these economies of scale  in turn  enable the company to offer its customers the most appropriate test for each specific customer application 
another key strategy that the company used to develop its business was the formation in of tsd bioservices  a joint venture between the company and a subsidiary of taconic farms of germantown  ny 
taconic farms is a privately held company whose business is the production and sale of mice and rats  primarily to the research community 
in  the joint venture was dissolved and the company s interests were distributed into a wholly owned subsidiary  tsd bioservices  inc tsd 
with tsd and the acquisitions of hti and the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies  the company formed a new operating division  strategic biosolutions  which has now become one of the largest producers of antibodies in the united states 
the mission of strategic biosolutions is to supply monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies  immunochemical reagents and related services to medical diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as research institutions 
the company believes certain of its products in the food safety and water quality testing markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets 
the company believes that its established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
on september   the company announced that it had entered into a non binding letter of intent to acquire azur environmental 
azur is a leading provider of innovative analytical systems for monitoring water quality throughout the world 
the purchase of azur environmental  whose corporate headquarters are located in carlsbad  california  is subject to due diligence and approval by both companies board of directors  approval of the stockholders of azur and other conditions 
the company expects that the azur acquisition will be consummated mid revenues in any particular quarter may not be indicative of revenues for any subsequent quarter during the year  or for the year 
as sales of the company s analytical tests for water soluble polymers which are generally not affected by seasonal patterns and food safety products to other parts of the world develop over the next few years  the company expects its seasonal fluctuations to become gradually less pronounced 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million or in versus this increase is the result of a million or increase in product related revenues offset by a thousand or decrease in contract and other revenues 
the growth in product revenues is predominately attributable to increases  primarily in the fourth quarter  in sales of products in the food safety category tests to detect genetic traits in genetically engineered plants  of gmos as sales in this category of products grew from the levels achieved in this increase was due primarily to sales of the company s products to detect the genetic traits in starlinktm corn 
sales of the company s trait check bt product exceeded one million tests  virtually all of which were sold in the fourth quarter of the company expects starlinktm sales to continue in  although at a lower rate than in the fourth quarter of revenues of antibody products grew from the levels  due primarily to the full year inclusion of revenues from the hti acquisition in february of  and the acquisition of the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies in may of see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the company s water quality marketing unit and decreases in sales of other products when compared to the revenues recorded in these categories 
revenues in the other products category in included sales of macra lp a testing kits  a product which the company sold in  but for which sales under a manufacturing agreement with the buyer of the product occurred during there were no comparable sales in the year the decline in contract and other revenues is primarily the result of the company s expanded emphasis on internal research and development programs versus contractual sponsored research and development programs 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million or in to million from million in  exclusive of the million one time charge in for acquired research and development as a result of the hti acquisition 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the general business activity that occurred during the year and is described below 
manufacturing expenses  which include the cost of products sold  increased million or in to million from million in this is primarily the result of the increase in product related revenues in and additional manufacturing expenses associated with the ramp in production to meet the strong demand for starlinktm tests 
we met this demand by increasing production to three shifts at certain times  particularly early in the quarter as we built inventories 
by the end of the quarter  we were able to smooth out production and returned to a more normalized production schedule 
we experienced price pressure in the food safety category later in the fourth quarter as competitors launched products 
we believe we have maintained our market leading position and attempted to meet this pressure with competitive pricing coupled with a high quality product 
we believe we will see relatively stable pricing from this point forward and we expect gross margins in the to range for the next few quarters versus and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased thousand or in to million from million in this increase was due to the company s continuing investment in new product development for its food safety marketing unit of products tests to detect genetic traits in genetically engineered plants and for other ongoing project expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased thousand or in to million from million in this increase was primarily the result of increased selling and marketing costs in the food safety and antibody product marketing unit 
interest expense net net interest expense increased thousand or  due to the higher levels of debt carried throughout the year versus the year income taxes during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a tax charge of thousand net of a reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately thousand and in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a tax benefit of million  also related to a reduction in the valuation allowance  all in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas since management believed that it is more likely than not that the company will realize that portion of the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets under sfas has no impact on the company s cash flows for income taxes 
as a result net income comparisons between and are not meaningful 
net income net income decreased exclusive of the income tax benefit and the million one time acquired research and development charge in  recorded in connection with the hti acquisition  decreased thousand or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the income tax provision of thousand for the year ended december   offset by a gain on sale of assets of thousand from the sale of the company s macra lp a product line  also recorded in the year pre tax income exclusive of the million one time acquired research and development charge increased by thousand or to million in from million in year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million or in versus this increase is the result of a million or increase in product related revenues offset by a thousand or decrease in contract and other revenues 
the growth in product revenues is primarily attributable to increases in sales of products in the agricultural category tests to detect genetic traits in genetically engineered plants  as sales in this category of products grew from the levels achieved in  resulting from the expansion of the agricultural product line to include kits designed for the quality assurance of foundation seed and the launch of a product line designed for the food processing and grain industry  and from increases in revenues of antibody products which grew from the levels  due primarily to the inclusion of revenues from the hti acquisition in february of  and the acquisition of the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies in may of  for which there were no comparable revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the company s water quality category of and other products categories when compared to the revenues recorded in these categories 
revenues in the other products category in included the sale of a line of antibodies and pre commercial macra lp a testing kits as described below for which there were no comparable amounts in the decline in contract and other revenues is primarily the result of the company s continued emphasis on internal research and development programs versus contractual research and development programs 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million or in to million from million in  exclusive of the million one time charge for acquired research and development as a result of the hti acquisition 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the general business activity that occurred during the year and is described below 
manufacturing expenses  which include the cost of products sold  increased million or in to million from million in this is primarily the result of the increase in product related revenues the company experienced in versus the same period in research and development expenses increased thousand or in to million from million in this increase was due to the company s continuing investment in new product development for its agricultural category of products tests to detect genetic traits in genetically engineered plants 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in to million from million in additional costs and acquired personnel  related to the acquisitions of hti and the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies  and the subsequent expansion of the antibody business through strategic biosolutions were the primary reasons for the increased costs in this category 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a one time special charge of million for in process research and development related to the acquisition of hti 
this item is more fully described in note to the financial statements mergers and acquisitions 
interest expense  net net interest and other income decreased thousand or  due to the interest paid on the million of acquisition financing used in the purchases of hti and the operating assets of the oem business of atlantic antibodies 
income taxes at december   the company had approximately million of gross deferred tax assets consisting primarily of the future tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize a portion of the benefit of such tax assets 
accordingly  the company reduced the valuation allowance against the asset and recorded a tax benefit of million in december the recognition of these deferred tax assets under sfas has no impact on the company s cash flows for income taxes despite the change in the company s effective tax rate 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets impacted reported earnings per share due to the benefit recorded to the statement of operations 
net income net income increased million or  exclusive of the income tax benefit and the million one time acquired research and development charge  recorded in connection with the hti acquisition 
this increase is primarily attributable to the increased sales of the company s agricultural and antibody products  and the corresponding economies of scale realized by the company s higher level of business activity 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital  which consists principally of cash  accounts receivable and inventory  increased thousand in to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the current portion of deferred tax assets  the voluntary repayment of debt and a more flexible structure of the company s indebtedness 
outstanding debt decreased million from million at december  to million on december  on may   the company entered into a financing agreement with a commercial bank  which provides for a million term loan  of which approximately million was outstanding at december   repayable over three years  and up to a million revolving line of credit  of which no amount was outstanding at december for the year ended december   the company s operating activities provided more than million in cash  a significant increase from the thousand provided in this cash  along with available cash balances and the proceeds from the financing described above  allowed the company to satisfy all of its operating cash requirements and reduce total debt outstanding by nearly million in at december   the company had million in long term debt and stockholders equity of over million 
the company believes it has  or has access to sufficient assets to meet its operating requirements for the forseeable future 
the company s ability to meet its long term capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy  consummation of the azur acquisition  which as presently contemplated will not require a significant cash investment  and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the future liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties see note to the consolidated financial statements
