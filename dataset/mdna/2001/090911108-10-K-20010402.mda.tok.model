liquidity and capital resources the company remains dependent upon its ability to obtain outside financing either through the issuance of additional shares of its common or preferred stock or through borrowings until it achieves sustained profitability through increased sales and improved product margins 
the company s business continues to focus on the manufacturing and marketing of its laser based hydrokinetic tm tissue cutting system  the waterlase tm and its new diode laser product  the twilite tm 
financing the development of laser based medical and dental devices and instruments and the operations of the company has been achieved principally through the private placements of preferred and common stock and the exercise of stock options and warrants  though the company has experienced significant increased sales of its laser based products over the last two years 
during the three years ended december   the company raised approximately  of net equity funds in this manner 
management believes that sales will continue to increase and that the company should have sufficient capital resources to sustain it during based on its business plan 
should the company require further capital resources during  it would most likely address such requirement through a combination of sales of its products  sales of equity securities through private placements  and or debt financings 
if circumstances changed  and additional capital was needed  no assurance can be given that the company would be able to obtain such additional capital resources 
if unexpected events occur requiring the company to obtain additional capital and it is unable to do so  it then might attempt to preserve its available resources by deferring the creation or satisfaction of various commitments  deferring the introduction of various products or entry into various markets  or otherwise scaling back its operations 
if the company were unable to raise such additional capital or defer certain costs as described above  such inability would have an adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  cash flows and prospects of the company and ultimately on its ability to continue as a going concern

the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  for the financing of inventory and is collateralized by substantially all of the company s accounts receivable and inventories 
the interest rate is fixed throughout the term of the credit agreement and is computed based upon libor plus at the time of any borrowings 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance was 
the company is required to reduce the outstanding loan balance by an amount equal to the cost of goods sold associated with sales of inventory upon collection of sales proceeds 
the current revolving credit agreement expires on december  at which point the company will be required to either pay any remaining balance of the credit facility or refinance the credit facility 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to refinance the line of credit or that the terms on which it may be able to refinance the line of credit will be as favorable as the terms of the existing line 
if the company is unable to refinance and is therefore required to repay the line of credit  the diversion of resources to that purpose may adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
the company s lease on its facility expired in september the lessor had notified the company that it did not intend to renew the lease with the company 
in response  the company researched similar leasing rates in close proximity to its present location and determined that competitive lease rates on a similar building in structure and size were dramatically higher than the company s current rate 
in addition  the cost of relocation to the company would have been substantial and could have included  but not have been limited to  business interruption costs  actual moving costs and large up front deposits typically required on new lease potentials 
accordingly  the company entered into an agreement to purchase its existing facility with escrow closing in august at a purchase price of  plus direct expenses of  the company paid  in cash and financed the remaining purchase with a  first trust deed mortgage 
the terms of the commitment include i a variable interest rate of prime plus  adjusted every three years currently  ii a term of years matures september   and iii a loan amortization term of years 
in march   the company entered into an agreement to sell the facility at a fair market value of  with a commitment to lease the facility for a term of years with an option to extend another years at a starting monthly lease rate of per square foot approximately  per month with incremental rate increases annually of no less than and no more than based on the increase in a local consumer price index

over the past three years  the inflation rate has been relatively low 
nonetheless  the company has continued to experience increases in the cost of labor and some materials  in the face of requests for price reductions from customers 
due to competitive forces and market imposed selling price ceilings during  the company was unable to raise prices to its customers to pass along the cost increases experienced
