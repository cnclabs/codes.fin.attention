quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as discussed under foreign currency effects  graco sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
graco uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce risks associated with foreign currency net monetary asset and liability positions 
these contracts typically have maturities of days or less  and gains or losses from changes in market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying balance sheet items 
at december   the foreign currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the european euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound  and korean won 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
to evaluate its currency exchange rate risks on its foreign exchange contracts  the company uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact on earnings of hypothetical changes in the value of foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
at december   due to the short term nature of the company s hedging instruments  reasonably likely fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect graco s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
when appropriate  the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in earnings due to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
at december   a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates  principally libor  would not materially increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows
