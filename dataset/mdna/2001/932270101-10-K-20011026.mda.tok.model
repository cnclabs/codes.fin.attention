item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment information integrated graphics segment the integrated graphics segment is made up of a national network of commercial print facilities and the targeted communications division which specializes in variable imaging and print on demand products used in the promotional printing market 
the principal products and services supplied by the integrated graphics segment include the design and manufacture of high color  high quality marketing and promotional materials  and the manufacture of targeted communications printed materials 
the company significantly increased its commitment to high color marketing and promotional printing in the second quarter of fiscal year with the acquisition of graphic industries graphic 
during fiscal year  the company took decisive action to divest non compatible product lines  expand geographic coverage and close underperforming facilities 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company announced a restructuring that included closing three underperforming plants in this segment by the end of the fiscal year 
two of these plants were acquired as part of the graphic acquisition 
also in fiscal year  the company acquired a small regional commercial printing operation in the midwestern united states  and sold quadras  a design concern that was part of the graphic acquisition 
in fiscal year  the company acquired a commercial printing operation which expanded its commercial printing network to the west coast of the united states  and divested mercury printing  also part of the graphic acquisition 
forms and labels segment the principal products and services supplied by the forms and labels segment include the design  manufacture and sale of both paper based and electronic business forms  the manufacture of both electronic data processing edp labels and prime labels  and the manufacture and distribution of a standard line of office products 
as a result of the restructuring in fiscal year  one multiple use plant in lebanon  kentucky was closed in the fourth quarter with its production being shifted to other company facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired a small prime label company 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company divested the operations of visible computer supply  a contract stationer business that did not fit with the long term strategic direction of the company 
results of operations fiscal year versus fiscal year revenue net sales for fiscal year increased over fiscal year the breakdown of sales for fiscal year within the two business segments was as follows business segment of total revenue revenue increase integrated graphics forms and labels over the last five years  sales have grown at a compound annual rate of  with most of the growth coming from acquisitions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the company s sales strategy can be broken into two components 
the primary driving force for sales growth is the company s total print management tpm strategy 
the objective of tpm is to provide all types of printed material produced by both segments to major contract customers  with the primary focus being fortune companies 
this is accomplished primarily through a national direct sales force  which sells all of the company s product offerings 
contract sales have grown over over the prior year 
contract sales for the forms and labels segment were up approximately whereas contract sales for the integrated graphics segment were up over 
the second key component of the sales strategy is the continued success in capturing local transactional business 
this is especially important in the integrated graphics segment  where a local sales force captures order by order business in its local market 
the national direct sales force also sells directly on an order by order basis 
non contract business declined approximately 
non contract sales in the forms and labels segment were relatively flat 
in the integrated graphics segment  the decline in transactional business was seen in the second half of the fiscal year and can be mainly attributed to the softening of the economy 
paper is the basic raw material for approximately of the company s products 
in the forms and labels segment  paper represents approximately of sales 
in the integrated graphic segment  paper represents approximately of sales 
the majority of paper used by the company comes from three paper grades uncoated free sheet  tablet and offset 
using pound uncoated free sheet as a proxy for the paper market  published prices during fiscal year increased  with the prices staying relatively constant in fiscal year the company continues to reduce its exposure to volatility in the paper market 
customer contracts signed as part of the tpm program contain provisions to increase or decrease sell prices in line with announced paper price changes 
additionally  the continual shift toward high color marketing and promotional printing  as well as growth in digital print and market to one programs further mitigates the overall impact of paper on operating margins 
products in the integrated graphics segment have a higher component of value added labor  and thus rely less on the price of paper 
despite changes in technology which have led to continuing declines in the business forms market  the company continues to grow revenue by exploring new business lines and growing existing ones 
the company s exceptional systems  service delivery  and distribution capabilities have allowed the company to increase its emphasis on services as part of its product offering 
currently  services such as inventory control and product distribution are sold with the printed product the company provides 
the company believes inventory and distribution services  along with kitting  custom programming  and sourcing of non printed goods can be sold independently of the printed product and offer an opportunity for revenue growth 
additionally  in fiscal year  the company entered into a licensing agreement to produce security labels 
the company used its extensive printing know how to develop a proprietary method of manufacturing a product not normally associated with a printing operation 
this type of niche market represents an opportunity to increase revenue in the label business 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percent of sales for fiscal year was versus in fiscal year the increased cost of goods sold percentage is primarily attributed to competitive pricing pressures and decreased utilization rates over the second half of fiscal year  both of which have been exacerbated by the economic slowdown 
in light of economic conditions  the company has increased some judgmental reserves  such as inventory reserves 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was seen in both segments of the business 
in the integrated graphics segment  cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased by approximately basis points 
this increase is largely attributable to competitive market conditions and the economic slowdown 
this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued segment was impacted by a slowing economy as many companies reduced their spending on marketing and promotional materials when conditions worsened 
the economic slowdown in the second half of the year has significantly impacted this segment 
through the first six months of the fiscal year  cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased by approximately basis points over the same period of the prior year 
the company believes that this increase reflected competitive market conditions up to that point 
in the second half of the year  sales declined in this segment  with cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increasing  on a fiscal year basis  by basis points 
while the economy will continue to affect this segment  the company believes that margins can be expanded in the integrated graphics segment through cost reductions and by continuing to increase contract sales which will increase equipment utilization 
in the forms and labels segment  cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased by approximately basis points 
excluding lifo income of million in the current fiscal year and lifo expense of million in the prior fiscal year  cost of goods sold as a percent of sales would have increased by basis points 
the lifo credit was the result of decreasing inventory quantities and stabilizing prices this year  while prices increased significantly in the prior year on grades of paper primarily used in this segment 
this segment is also experiencing gross margin compression as a result of economic softness and ongoing competition 
due to changes in technology  the business forms market has continued to decline 
forms manufacturers are continuing to compete for a share of the shrinking market which has resulted in lower overall selling prices 
competitive pressures in the forms industry have compelled many forms manufacturers to move into the growing label market 
this shift has brought price competition into this arena as well 
the company continually looks for niche markets to continue to expand revenue and margins in the label market 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were in fiscal year versus in fiscal year several one time charges have significantly impacted this category 
in the current fiscal year  a charge of million was recorded due to a change in an accounting estimate for workers compensation 
in fiscal year  charges related to executive retirement benefits and other costs related to management changes totalled million 
additional charges of million included an adjustment to the reserve for postretirement medical costs of million that arose from a change in actuarial assumptions utilized to estimate the benefit  and million related to an adverse judgment in an arbitration proceeding arising from a contractual obligation of graphic industries 
without these one time charges  selling and administrative expenses would have been of sales in the current year versus in the prior year 
overall selling and administrative expense has benefited significantly from the restructuring and other cost saving initiatives initiated in the third quarter of fiscal year offsetting some of this benefit  the company has experienced deterioration of its accounts receivable portfolio  primarily as a result of the weakening economy 
the resultant increase in accounts receivable reserves has increased selling and administrative expense in the second half of fiscal year depreciation and amortization the provision for depreciation and amortization remained consistent from year to year at of sales 
goodwill amortization declined slightly as reductions were made to purchase accounting reserves for the graphic industries acquisition which reduced total goodwill 
these adjustments were the result of a decrease in the amount of pre acquisition contingencies existing as of the date of acquisition 
software amortization increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year most of the increase is related to amortization of a million system enhancement project which began in fiscal year and whose final phase was fully implemented in the current fiscal year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company announced a restructuring plan and undertook initiatives to reduce the overall cost base of the company 
residual charges of that restructuring plan amounted to million in the current fiscal year 
fiscal year results include a pretax charge of million related to the restructuring plan 
the company implemented the restructuring program because of continued softness in the high quality color marketing and promotional printing market  along with other issues relating to the integration of the graphic industries acquisition 
management reviewed its operations and developed action plans relating to both segments that dealt with underperforming facilities  underutilized assets  and rationalization of certain product lines 
to improve prospective financial and operational performance  the company is evaluating additional cost reduction actions including further reductions in workforce  plant consolidations and production process improvements 
interest expense net interest expense for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year approximately million of the decrease is related to lower interest rates in fiscal year the remainder relates to the significant decrease in debt during the year 
the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates during fiscal year would not have had a significant impact on net earnings of the company 
other income other income in fiscal year of million represented the proceeds received from the sale of stock that the company received in john hancock s conversion from a policyholder owned company to a stockholder based company 
the company received shares in relation to the amount of corporate owned life insurance policies held with john hancock

in fiscal year  due primarily to the restructuring charges  a portion of which were not deductible  the effective tax rate was 
net income and net income per diluted share net income for the year increased by million or  to million or per diluted share 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenue net sales for fiscal year increased over fiscal year pro forma sales growth after adjusting for acquisitions  divestitures and closures was 
the breakdown of net sales for fiscal year within the two business segments was as follows business segment of total revenue revenue increase integrated graphics forms and labels after adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures  the integrated graphics segment grew and the forms and labels segment grew 
over the last five years  sales have grown at a compound annual rate of  with most of the growth coming from acquisitions 
contract sales to major customers under the tpm strategy increased from fiscal year to fiscal year before divestitures 
contract sales for the integrated graphics segment again before divestitures were up item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued whereas contract sales for the forms and labels segment were up 
adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures  non contract business grew in fiscal year  with growth coming from both segments 
paper price changes have a material effect on the company s reported sales dollars and operating results 
prices on pound white uncoated free sheet increased from january  to july  prices continued to increase in fiscal year  being up an additional by the end of fiscal year the company has continued to reduce its exposure to this volatility by including provisions in contracts that adjust sell prices in light of announced paper price changes 
additionally  the product mix shift to high color and promotional printing helps to mitigate the overall impact of paper on operating margins 
new business opportunities such as the production of security labels and the increased offering of inventory and distribution services also reduce reliance on paper 
in the second quarter of fiscal year the company divested its contract stationer business  which had annual revenues of approximately million  because it did not fit with the long term strategic objectives of the company 
in conjunction with the sale of this business to boise cascade office products bcop  the company expanded its alliance with bcop in order to better serve the needs of its customers 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percent of sales for fiscal year was versus in fiscal year the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was seen in both segments of the business 
this trend  however  was more pronounced in the forms and labels segment where cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased by approximately basis points 
fifty basis points of the increase was related to an unfavorable change in lifo expense  which was the result of higher prices in paper grades used by the segment 
the company was also experiencing gross margin compression as a result of ongoing competition 
technology changes have continued to cause the business forms market to decline 
in the integrated graphics segment  cost of goods sold as a percent of sales increased by approximately basis points 
the increase was largely attributable to competitive market conditions predominantly in the eastern and southeastern united states 
the increase in cost of goods sold in those regions were partially offset by decreases in the targeted communications division s cost of goods sold  which benefited from increased sales in market to one product  which has a lower cost of sales due to lower paper content 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were in fiscal year and in fiscal year several one time charges related to executive retirement benefits  reserves for postretirement medical costs and an adverse judgement in an arbitration proceeding were included in fiscal year and totalled million

there were no yk related software expenses in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year depreciation and amortization the provision for depreciation and amortization was of sales in both fiscal year and fiscal year software amortization increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year most of the increase was related to a million system enhancement project which began in fiscal year and was being implemented in phases 
restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company announced a restructuring plan and undertook initiatives to reduce the overall cost base of the company 
the fiscal year results include a pretax charge of million related to the restructuring plan 
the charge included the write off of goodwill associated with plants that were closed  the write off of abandoned software  the write down to net realizable value of property and equipment to be sold  and severance and outplacement costs 
the amount of allocated goodwill written off related to plants acquired in the graphic item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued acquisition 
the majority of the restructuring activity  and related charges  occurred in the third quarter 
interest expense net interest expense for fiscal year increased million over fiscal year the increase is mostly from higher interest rates on variable rate debt  along with incremental interest expense resulting from the issuance of million of fixed rate bonds in the second quarter of fiscal year in which the proceeds were used to pay down variable rate debt 
other income other income included a one time credit of million which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year and represented the proceeds received from the sale of stock that the company received in john hancock s conversion from a policyholder owned company to a stockholder based company 
the company received shares in relation to the amount of corporate owned life insurance policies held with john hancock

the company s effort in these respects was completed as of december  substantially all of the company s software  firmware  hardware including embedded chips and equipment used in its printing operations  including its pre press and press equipment and its equipment used to finish and deliver its products  were not materially affected by a year related failure 
also  the company did not experience any year related problems caused by key suppliers or customers whose systems interact with those of the company 
in addition  the company did not experience any year related failure caused by utility companies  telecommunication services providers  delivery services  the financial services industry and other suppliers outside of its control 
the passing of december  and other high risk dates ie february  with no major negative impact from a national standpoint mitigates the risk of any future major year related disruptions
