vs 
interest and fees on loans decreased to  for the year ended september  as compared to  for the year ended september  the decrease of  was primarily the result of a decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding during the year 
the average balance of loans declined from  in fiscal to  causing a decline in interest income of  during the current fiscal year two loans were classified as non accrual 
these loans caused an additional decline in interest income of  these declines were offset by an increase in the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio 
the average interest rate on loans increased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal this accounted for an increase of  in interest income 
operating income on real estate assets  which is composed primarily of rental income  decreased  from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  this decline was the result of brt s contribution of a property to a limited liability company at the end of the prior fiscal year 
this contribution resulted in a decline in rental income of  this property is now accounted for using the equity method of accounting and its results are no longer consolidated with the financial statements of the trust 
this decline was offset by an  increase in other rental revenues 
the fiscal year was favorably affected by revenues of  recognized from the recovery of previously provided allowances and write offs 
this was related to a loan that paid off in full in fiscal there was no comparable revenue item in the current fiscal year 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures increased in the fiscal year ended september  to  from a loss of  in the prior fiscal year ended september  in the prior fiscal year brt contributed a property to a limited liability company which is now accounted for using the equity method

gain on the sale of foreclosed properties declined in the fiscal year ended september  to  from  in the prior fiscal year

there was no such gain in the current fiscal year 
in the current fiscal year  the trust also recognized miscellaneous gains totaling  outlook the real estate business in general is cyclical and to a large extent depends upon  among other factors  national and local business and economic conditions  government economic policies and the level of interest rates 
most economists indicate that the national economy has been in a recessionary mode for many months 
in addition  the september  terrorist attacks have had a negative effect on the economy of new york city and throughout the country 
notwithstanding the difficult national and local economies which is projected by some economists to be on the upswing in and the effect of the events of september th  brt to date has not experienced any material adverse effects on its business 
however  a difficult or declining real estate market in the new york metropolitan area or in other parts of the country could potentially have the following adverse effects on brt s business i an increase in loan defaults which will result in decreased interest and fees on real estate loans  an increase in loan loss reserves and an increase in expenses incurred in foreclosures and restructurings  ii a decrease in loan originations  and iii a decrease in rental income from properties owned by the trust or joint ventures in which brt is a venture participant and an increase in operating expenses related to real estate properties 
however  a declining real estate market could also pose opportunities for brt  since in a declining market other lenders  particularly institutional lenders  become more conservative in their lending activities 
if such a lending environment occurs  the amount of potential business for brt could increase 
brt s management is aware of the difficulties which could be encountered in a declining real estate environment 
it therefore continually monitors its mortgage portfolio for compliance by its borrowers 
management also believes that its loan underwriting policies will ultimately result in minimizing the negative long term effects of a declining real estate environment 
since approximately of brt s loan portfolio provides for stated minimum or fixed interest rates  the current low interest rate environment  although negatively affecting brt s revenues and net income  has not had and should not have a material adverse effect on revenues and net income 
brt s loan portfolio is to a large extent adjustable  based on prime 
accordingly  any increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on brt s revenues and income 
cash distribution policy brt has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code for more than eighteen years 
to qualify as a real estate investment trust  brt must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it distribute currently at least of its adjusted taxable income to its shareholders 
it is management s current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain the trust s real estate investment trust status 
as a real estate investment trust  brt generally will not be subject to corporate federal income tax on taxable income it distributes currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to its shareholders 
if brt fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year  it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a real estate investment trust for four subsequent tax years 
even if brt qualifies for federal taxation as a real estate investment trust  it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income  ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
as a result of accumulated tax losses  brt was not required to make cash distributions to shareholders to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes until its accumulated tax losses were fully used 
the accumulated tax losses were fully used during the calendar year and brt resumed the payment of cash distributions in july  for tax purposes  brt is on a calendar year basis as distinguished from financial reporting purposes for which it is on a september th fiscal year 
through the date of this form k  brt has paid cash distributions at the rate of 
per share per quarter totalling  including a cash distribution of 
a share to be paid on january  to holders of record on december   brt will have paid  for calendar the company estimates its taxable income for will be  after the utilization of any remaining net operating loss carryforwards  of which approximately  represents capital gains income 
it is brt s intention to pay to its shareholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code of its annual taxable income  excluding gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on sale of available for sale securities 
the board of trustees has not yet determined if it will distribute capital gains income to its shareholders 
item a market risk disclosure brt s primary component of market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
brt s interest income and to a lesser extent its interest expense are subject to changes in interest rates 
brt seeks to minimize these risks by originating loans that are indexed to the prime rate  with a stated minimum interest rate  and borrowing  when necessary  from its available credit line which is also indexed to the prime rate 
at september  approximately of the portfolio was variable rate based primarily on the prime rate 
any changes in the prime interest rate could have a positive or negative effect on the net interest income of brt 
when determining interest rate sensitivity brt assumes that any change in interest rates is immediate and that the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remain constant over the period being measured 
brt has assessed the market risk for its variable rate mortgage receivables and variable rate debt and believes that a one percent increase in interest rates would have approximately a  positive effect on income before taxes and a one percent decline in interest rates would have approximately a  negative effect on income before taxes 
in addition  brt originates loans with short maturities and maintains a strong capital position 
at september  brt s loan portfolio was primarily secured by properties located in the new york metropolitan area  new jersey and connecticut and in florida and it is therefore subject to risks associated with the economies of these localities
