overview we are a leading provider of enterprise e conferencing solutions that enable geographically dispersed organizations to collaborate in real time 
the company s award winning meetingplace system is designed for enterprise wide deployment to improve the ability of employees  partners  and customers to meet and work 
with meetingplace  participants can schedule and attend a meeting  view  share and edit documents  and capture and retrieve meeting content 
meetingplace is designed to be an enterprise wide resource and to leverage existing technologies such as telephones  cellular phones and personal computers 
we were incorporated in april from inception until december  our operations consisted primarily of basic start up activities  such as research and development and recruiting personnel 
we first recognized revenue from product sales in december and generated revenue of million  million and million in  and we generated net income of million in  million in  and  in the net income in included the effect of a one time deferred tax benefit of million due to the recognition of our deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit since inception of million 
we cannot assure you that our revenues will continue to grow or that we will maintain profitability in the future 
we generate revenue from sales of our meetingplace products and from customer support and consulting services 
revenue derived from product sales constituted  and of our total revenue in  and product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable and  if applicable  acceptance has been obtained 
we calculate an allowance for returns based on historical rates 
service revenue includes revenue from implementation and integration services  system management services  warranty coverage and customer support 
revenue from implementation and system integration services is recognized as the services are performed  while revenue from system management services  warranty coverage and customer support is recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
beginning in  we expect to expand our service offerings by providing hosted services to our customers 
accordingly  future revenue from this new service offering will increase the proportion of total revenue derived from services 
to the extent that prospective customers elect to purchase the hosted service rather than an on premises meetingplace system  our product revenue could be adversely affected 
we sell our meetingplace products primarily through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through indirect distribution channels 
the majority of our revenue is derived from fortune companies  many of which initially purchase meetingplace servers and later expand deployment of our products as they require additional capacity for voice and web conferencing 
in  we expanded into international markets by opening a sales and support office in the united kingdom and establishing distributor relationships in hong kong and singapore  and in  we established a distributor relationship in australia 
while we intend to increase sales through indirect channels and internationally  we cannot assure you that we will be successful 
in  we expanded the breadth of our support services by establishing a consulting services group to provide expanded implementation services  system management services and customized project consulting 
in  we opened a sales and support office in singapore 
in addition  in and  we increased our distribution partners to include global partnerships  application service providers and partners focused on the us federal government total cost of revenue consists of component and materials costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties and overhead related to manufacturing of our products  as well as materials  travel and labor costs related to personnel engaged in our service operations 
product gross margin is impacted by the proportion of product revenue derived from software sales  which typically carry higher margins than hardware sales  and from indirect distribution channels  which typically carry lower margins than direct sales 
service gross margin is impacted by the mix of services we provide  which have different levels of profitability  and the efficiency with which we provide full care support to our customers 
we record an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory by identifying inventory components either considered excess based on estimates of future usage or obsolete due to changes in our products 
as a result of technological changes  our products may become obsolete or we could be required to redesign our products 
results of operations the following table lists  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue of each line item years ended december  as a percentage of total revenue revenue product service total revenue cost of revenue product service total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income expense  net income before benefit from provision for income tax benefit from provision for income tax net income product revenue product revenue was million in  million in and million in product revenue increased from to and from to the increases in product revenue were due primarily to increased sales of our meetingplace products domestically to new customers  increased sales of additional products and features to existing customers  and  to a lesser extent  increased international sales 
international sales represented  and of product revenue in  and an allowance for potential sales returns is recorded upon shipment 
at the end of each period  the allowance is adjusted based on our product return experience and for changes in the range of per system sales prices of systems shipped 
as a result of this analysis  we believe that our allowance for potential sales returns of  at december  and  at december   was adequate but not excessive based on the historical experience and per system sales prices  software upgrade sales returns and outstanding accounts receivable balances 
our sales returns to date have approximated our estimated allowance for returns 
service revenue service revenue was million in  million in and million in service revenue increased from to and from to the increases in service revenue were attributable primarily to growth in our customer base during these periods  which led to increased sales of full care support services  as well as to the introduction of additional consulting services such as managed services and expanded implementation and integration services 
total cost of revenue total cost of revenue was million in  million in and million in total cost of revenue increased from to and from to the increases in total cost of revenue were attributable primarily to increased sales of our meetingplace products and related services  as well as the increased size of our services staff and the costs of providing services to support an increasingly geographically dispersed customer base 
gross margin declined to in  from in and in the decline in gross margin from to is attributable primarily to increased sales through distribution channels 
the increase in gross margin from to is attributable primarily to increased economies of scale resulting from increased product and service revenue  as well as to increased sales of meetingplace software and enhanced features to existing customers 
on a forward looking basis  we anticipate that gross margins may continue to decline as the proportions of revenue derived from sales made through distributors are expected to increase as percentages of total revenue 
product gross margin in  and was  and 
we expect product gross margin to decrease over time due in part to anticipated pricing pressure and an expected increase in the proportion of revenue derived from expanded services 
an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded at the end of each period based on an analysis of inventory on hand  considering forecasted usage and whether component parts are useable in our current product and whether finished goods are versions of our product for which demand is forecasted 
as a result of this analysis  we believe that our allowance for excess and obsolete inventory of  at december  and  at december  was adequate but not excessive based on the specific identification of excess or obsolete inventory 
service gross margin in  and was  and 
we expect service gross margin to decline over time as a result of increasing costs of service combined with changes in the mix of our service based offerings 
research and development expenses the table below sets forth gross research and development expenses  capitalized internal software development costs and net research and development expenses in dollar amounts and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  gross research and development expenses    capitalized internal software development costs net research and development expenses  as a percentage of total revenue gross research and development expenses net research and development expenses net research and development expenses increased from to and from to the increases are attributable primarily to the addition of personnel in our research and development organization associated with product development  combined with expenses associated with technology licensed from third parties 
marketing and sales expenses marketing and sales expenses were million in  million in and million in marketing and sales expenses increased from to and from to the increases reflected the addition of personnel in our sales and marketing organizations  as well as costs associated with increased selling efforts to develop market awareness of our products and services 
marketing and sales expenses were  and of total revenue for  and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses increased from to and from to general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the addition of personnel performing general and administrative functions as a public company 
general and administrative expenses were  and of total revenue for  and we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for credit losses at the end of each period based on an analysis of individual aged accounts receivable balances 
as a result of this analysis  we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  was adequate but not excessive based on specific aged account balances identified with collection risk 
amortization of deferred stock compensation total deferred stock compensation related to grants of stock options was  in and million in of the total deferred stock compensation  approximately  was amortized in   was amortized in and  was amortized in interest income expense  net in and  we had net interest income of approximately million and million  while in  we incurred net interest expense of approximately  the increase in net interest income from to is due to the interest earned on our portfolio of marketable securities and our cash and cash equivalents balances which have increased due to the proceeds from our initial public offering in may as well as cash generated from operations 
income taxes in  we had a net provision for income taxes of million 
in  we had a net benefit from income taxes of million 
the benefit was due primarily to the recognition of our deferred tax assets of million  offset by income tax expense of approximately  in  the provision for income tax was approximately  in  we provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized its deferred tax assets as it determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets were realizable based primarily on its operating results in and from inception through  we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and did not recognize any tax provision or benefit during this period 
as of december   we had million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards  if not utilized  expire in through as of december   we had approximately  of federal and  of state carryforwards for research and development and other credits 
these carryforwards  if not utilized  expire in through the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards where there is an ownership change 
under the tax reform act of  the determination of whether an ownership change occurs involves a highly complex calculation  however  an ownership change generally occurs when over in value of a company s stock is transferred in transactions involving stockholders during a given period 
if we should have an ownership change  our utilization of these carryforwards could be restricted 
liquidity and capital resources in may  we completed an initial public offering of common stock  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  which represented of total assets 
cash provided by operating activities was  in  compared to million in cash provided by operating activities in was lower than primarily due to decreased net income during the period and an increase in working capital 
cash provided by investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of the net maturities of available for sale securities of million  partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment of million 
in  cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily of the net purchase of available for sale securities of million and purchase of property and equipment of million 
cash provided by financing activities in of  consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  partially offset by payments on obligations under capital leases and notes payable 
in  cash provided by financing activities of million consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public stock offering of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months

factors affecting future operating results in addition to the other information in this annual report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company s business and prospects our future profitability is uncertain due to our limited operating history 
we have a limited operating history and cannot assure you that our revenue will continue to grow or that we will be profitable or will maintain profitability in the future 
our financial statements must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in the early stages of development 
we rely substantially on sales of our meetingplace products  which have limited market acceptance 
recent economic developments have caused many companies to reduce headcount and overhead expenses and to reconsider or delay capital expenditures 
this may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to grow revenue 
in addition  we are unable to predict our future product development  sales and marketing  and administrative expenses 
to the extent that these expenses increase  we will need to increase revenue to sustain profitability 
our ability to increase revenue and sustain profitability also depends on the other risk factors described in this section 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results are difficult to predict 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
the factors that may cause fluctuations of our operating results include the following changes in our mix of revenues generated from product sales and services  changes by existing customers in their levels of purchases of our products and services  changes in our mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  and changes in our mix of domestic and international sales 
additionally  beginning in  we expect to expand our service offerings by providing hosted services to our customers 
accordingly  future revenue from this new service offering will increase the proportion of total revenue derived from services 
to the extent that prospective customers elect to purchase the hosted service rather than an on premises meetingplace system  our product revenue could be adversely affected 
orders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter 
in addition  a significant portion of our orders are received in the last month of each fiscal quarter 
if we fail to ship products by the end of a quarter in which the order is received  or if our prospective customers delay their orders or delivery schedules until the following quarter  we may fail to meet our revenue objectives 
our market is highly competitive 
because of intense market competition  we may not be successful 
currently  our principal competitors include major telecommunications carriers that operate service bureaus for voice conferencing  such as at t corp  mci worldcom  inc and sprint corporation  private branch exchange  or pbx  vendors that sell systems with voice conferencing capabilities  such as lucent technologies inc and nortel networks  and smaller companies that offer web based voice and data conferencing products 
many of these companies have longer operating histories  stronger brand names and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
these companies also may have existing relationships with many of our prospective customers 
in addition  these companies may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future which could adversely affect our ability to increase sales  penetrate new markets and maintain average selling prices 
in the future  we may experience competition from potential competitors that include networking companies  such as cisco systems  inc  com corporation  lucent technologies inc and nortel networks that are focusing on enabling the transmission of voice over the internet and that may offer voice and data conferencing functionality  and collaborative software providers  such as microsoft corporation and lotus development corporation  that are focusing on data conferencing products and that may in the future incorporate voice conferencing functionality into their products 
our market is in an early stage of development  and our products may not be adopted 
if the market for our integrated voice and web conferencing products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we anticipate  we may not be able to increase revenues or remain profitable 
the market for integrated real time voice and web conferencing is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
our ability to remain profitable depends in large part on the widespread adoption by end users of real time voice and web conferencing 
we will have to devote substantial resources to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products 
in addition  businesses that have invested substantial resources in other conferencing products may be reluctant or slow to adopt our products  which might replace or compete with their existing systems 
our efforts to educate potential customers may not result in our products achieving market acceptance 
rapid technological changes could cause our products to become obsolete or require us to redesign our products 
the market in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
in particular  we expect that the growth of the internet and internet based telephony applications  as well as general technology trends such as migrations to new operating systems  will require us to adapt our product to remain competitive 
this adaptation could be costly and time consuming 
our products could become obsolete and unmarketable if products using new technologies are introduced and new industry standards emerge 
for example  the widespread acceptance of competing technologies  such as video conferencing and the transmission of voice over the internet  could diminish demand for our current products 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is difficult to estimate 
to be successful  we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards  such as the transmission of voice over the internet  in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop these types of products and product enhancements or that our products will achieve broad market acceptance 
our sales cycle is lengthy and unpredictable 
any delay in sales of our products could cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
the typical sales cycle of our products is lengthy  generally between six to nine months  unpredictable  and involves significant investment decisions by prospective customers  as well as our education of potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
furthermore  many of our prospective customers have not budgeted expenses for voice and web conferencing systems and do not have personnel specifically dedicated to procurement and implementation of these conferencing systems 
as a result  our customers spend a substantial amount of time before purchasing our products in performing internal reviews and obtaining capital expenditure approvals 
we cannot be certain that this cycle will not lengthen in the future 
the emerging and evolving nature of the real time voice and web conferencing market may lead to confusion in the market  which may cause prospective customers to postpone their purchase decisions 
if we fail to expand our sales and distribution channels  our business could suffer 
if we are unable to expand our sales and distribution channels  we may not be able to increase revenue or achieve market acceptance of our meetingplace product 
we have recently expanded our direct sales force and plan to recruit additional sales personnel 
new sales personnel will require training and take time to achieve full productivity  and there is strong competition for qualified sales personnel in our business 
in addition  we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners 
to date  we have entered into agreements with only a small number of these distribution partners 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to reach agreement with additional distribution partners on a timely basis or at all  or that these distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our products 
furthermore  if our distribution partners fail to adequately market or support our products  the reputation of our products in the market may suffer 
in addition  we will need to manage potential conflicts between our direct sales force and third party reselling efforts 
our ability to expand into international markets is uncertain 
we intend to continue to expand our operations into new international markets 
in addition to general risks associated with international expansion  such as foreign currency fluctuations and political and economic instability  we face the following risks and uncertainties any of which could prevent us from selling our products in a particular country or harm our business operations once we have established operations in that country the difficulties and costs of localizing products for foreign markets  including the development of multilingual capabilities in our meetingplace system  the need to modify our products to comply with local telecommunications certification requirements in each country  and our lack of a direct sales presence in other countries  our need to establish relationships with distribution partners to sell our products in these markets and our reliance on the capabilities and performance of these distribution partners 
if we fail to integrate our products with third party technology  our sales could suffer 
our products are designed to integrate with our customers data and voice networks  as well as with enterprise applications such as browsers and collaborative software applications 
if we are unable to integrate our products with these networks and systems  sales of our products could suffer 
in addition  we may be required to engage in costly and time consuming redesigns of our products because of technology enhancements or upgrades of these systems 
we may not be able to redesign our products or be certain that any of these redesigns will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  we will need to continually modify our products as newer versions of the enterprise applications with which our products integrate are introduced 
our ability to do so largely depends on our ability to gain access to the advanced programming interfaces for these applications  and we cannot assure you that we will have access to necessary advanced programming interfaces in the future 
we may experience difficulties managing our expected growth 
our recent growth has strained  and we expect that any future growth will continue to strain  our management systems and resources  which could hinder our ability to continue to grow in the future 
we may also experience difficulties meeting the demand for our products and services 
if we are unable to provide training and support for our products  the implementation process will be longer and customer satisfaction may be lower 
we may not be able to install management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
competition for qualified personnel in the san francisco bay area  as well as other markets in which we recruit  is extremely intense and characterized by rapidly increasing salaries  which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates 
our business could suffer if we lose the services of our current management team 
our future success depends on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
if we were to lose the services of any of these key employees we may encounter difficulties finding qualified personnel to replace them 
the loss of our right to use technology licensed to us by third parties could harm our business 
we license technology that is incorporated into our products from third parties  including digital signal processing algorithms and the meetingplace server s operating system and relational database 
any interruption in the supply or support of any licensed software could disrupt our operations and delay our sales  unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by this licensed software 
because our products incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties  we depend on these third parties to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
any interruption in supply of components from outside manufacturers and suppliers could hinder our ability to ship products in a timely manner 
we rely on third parties to obtain most of the components of the meetingplace server and integrate them with other standard components  such as the central processing unit and disk drives 
if these third parties are no longer able to supply and assemble these components or are unable to do so in a timely manner  we may experience delays in shipping our products and have to invest resources in finding an alternative manufacturer or manufacture our products internally 
in addition  we obtain key hardware components  including the processors and digital signal processing devices used in the meetingplace server  from sole source suppliers 
in the past  we have experienced problems in obtaining some of these components in a timely manner from these sources  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to obtain an adequate supply of these components in a timely manner or  if necessary  from alternative sources 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components or to locate alternative sources of supply  we may experience delays in shipping our products and incur additional costs to find an alternative manufacturer or manufacture our products internally 
our products may suffer from defects  errors or breaches of security 
software and hardware products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
any errors or defects that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our customer relationships or reputation or increased service and warranty cost 
our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  and we are aware of instances in which some of our customers have experienced product failures or errors 
many of our customers conduct confidential conferences  and transmit confidential data  using meetingplace 
concerns over the security of information sent over the internet and the privacy of its users may inhibit the market acceptance of our products 
in addition  unauthorized users in the past have gained  and in the future may be able to gain  access to our customers meetingplace systems 
any compromise of security could deter people from using meetingplace and could harm our reputation and business and result in claims against us 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  and we may be subject to infringement claims 
unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  which could cause our business to suffer 
furthermore  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in the future  we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement of third party proprietary rights 
any of these claims  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us 
parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief  which could prevent us from selling our products 
dell computer corporation has registered the latitude mark for computers in the united states and in other countries 
dell s united states trademark registration and canadian application have blocked our ability to register the latitude communications and latitude with logo marks in the united states and the latitude communications mark in canada 
since we believe that we have priority of trade name usage in the united states  we have petitioned to cancel dell s united states registration and opposed its canadian application 
the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain 
if dell s registration for the latitude mark is not canceled or if we are unable to obtain consent from dell for our registration of our marks  we may not be able to register our marks and would have to rely solely on common law protection for these marks 
we cannot assure you that we will be free from challenges of or obstacles to our use or registration of our marks 
we are subject to government regulation  and our failure to comply with these regulations could harm our business 
our products are subject to a wide variety of safety  emissions and compatibility regulations imposed by governmental authorities in the united states or in other countries in which we sell our products 
if we are unable to obtain necessary approvals or maintain compliance with the regulations of any particular jurisdiction  we may be prohibited from selling our products in that territory 
in addition  to sell our products in many international markets  we are required to obtain certifications that are specific to the local telephony infrastructure 
our stock price may be volatile 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
in addition  due to the technology intensive and emerging nature of our business  the market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to announcements of technological or competitive developments  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  or the gain or loss by us of significant orders 
our executive officers and directors and their affiliates own a large percentage of our voting stock and could control the voting power of the common stock 
executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  a large percentage of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders are able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay  deter or prevent transactions that would result in the change of control  which in turn could reduce the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the portfolio includes only securities with maturities of three to months and with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands 
total certificates of deposit   average interest rate corporate notes and bonds   average interest rate us federal agencies   average interest rate currently  the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we do expect to effect some transactions in foreign currencies in the next months  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains and losses will be significant 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date
