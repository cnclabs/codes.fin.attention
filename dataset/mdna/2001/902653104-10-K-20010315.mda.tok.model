credit facilities in june  united dominion closed on a million three year unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with a consortium of banks 
the credit facility  which extends until august  replaces two lines of credit that allowed the company to borrow in aggregate up to million 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility leaving million available for use 
under the credit facility  the company may borrow at a rate of libor plus basis points for libor based borrowings

derivative instruments as part of united dominion s overall interest rate risk management strategy  the company uses off balance sheet derivatives as a means to modify the interest rate characteristics of on balance sheet debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing transactions 
the company s off balance sheet derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management include various interest rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of specific financial instruments of united dominion 
the company believes that it has appropriately controlled the risk so that derivatives used for interest rate risk management will not have any material unintended effect on consolidated earnings 
derivative contracts did not have a material impact on the results of operations during see note financial instruments 
effective january   united dominion will be required to adopt the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards no 
and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
all of the company s derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions of the statements see note summary of significant accounting policies 
market risk united dominion is exposed to market risk principally from interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced 
united dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets 
united dominion s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by the company s finance department 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
united dominion s earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates on its variable rate debt and the refinancing of fixed rate debt 
a large portion of united dominion s market risk is exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under its credit facility  which totaled million at december  the impact on united dominion s financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during was not material 
at december   the notional value of united dominion s derivative products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk was million of interest rate swaps under which united dominion pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate 
these agreements effectively fix million of united dominion s variable rate notes payable to a weighted average fixed rate of 
at december   the fair market value of the interest rate swaps in an unfavorable value position to united dominion was million see note financial instruments 
if interest rates were basis points more or less at december   the fair market value of the interest rate swaps would have increased or decreased approximately million and million  respectively 
if market interest rates for variable rate debt average basis points more in than they did during  united dominion s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements  would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by million 
comparatively  if market interest rates for variable rate debt averaged basis points more in than it did in  united dominion s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements  would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by million 
if market rates for fixed rate debt were basis points higher at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from billion to billion 
if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were basis points lower at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from billion to billion 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on united dominion s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in united dominion s financial structure 
results of operations vs net income available to common shareholders was million 
per share for the year ended december  compared to million 
per share for  representing a decrease of million

the decrease was primarily due to the following factors i property operating income growth generated from the performance of the portfolio during was offset by the decrease in the size of the portfolio due to the disposition program  ii united dominion recognized million
