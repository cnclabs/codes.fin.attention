item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general sale of leavitt tube in fourth quarter  the company decided to pursue the sale of leavitt 
on march   the company signed a definitive agreement to sell leavitt to privately held pinkert industrial group  llc  headquartered in chicago  for approximately million  subject to closing adjustments 
the sale is scheduled to close on march  including the tax benefit  the company expects to realize cash proceeds of approximately million from this sale and recorded a million  net of taxes  estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fourth quarter consequently  the financial statements reflect leavitt as a discontinued operation 
operations the company has a brass products segment operated by cbcc and a steel products segment operated by leavitt  which has been classified as a discontinued operation 
the company is a leading manufacturer of free machining and forging brass rod 
cbcc 
cbcc is an iso certified manufacturer and supplier of free machining and forging brass rod in the united states and canada 
cbcc s net sales represent gross sales of brass rod less sales discounts 
the gross sales price of brass rod consists of a metal price charged to customers and a fabrication price as separate components 
cost of goods sold includes freight delivery costs  the cost of brass scrap  which is the principal raw material used in the manufacturing process and the primary component of cost of goods sold  as well as the costs of labor  energy and other materials and supplies used in fabricating the brass scrap into finished rod 
therefore  cbcc s profit levels depend primarily on the amount of finished rod shipped  fabrication prices and the difference between the metal price charged to customers and cbcc s cost of brass scrap 
cbcc obtains approximately of the brass scrap used in its operations from its customers through purchase and tolling arrangements 
the metal price charged to customers the metal selling price was four cents per pound higher than the price at which brass scrap is purchased from customers the metal buying price from december until december in december  the difference was increased to five cents per pound  and in january the difference was increased to seven cents per pound 
the difference between the metal selling price and the metal buying price was increased to eight cents per pound in september cbcc also purchases approximately of its brass scrap from scrap dealers at prevailing free market prices 
free market prices of brass scrap fluctuate based on the supply of and demand for brass scrap and the prices for copper and zinc the major components of brass  and generally are less than the metal buying price 
since  free market prices  as compared to metal buying prices  have been favorable to cbcc by historical standards and the supply of brass scrap in the united states has increased in excess of demand as a result of increased imports of brass rod 
although the increased supply of brass scrap has resulted in continued favorable free market scrap prices through december  there can be no assurance that such discounts will continue 
decreasing imports of brass rod and increasing demand for brass scrap could cause free market brass scrap prices to increase  and increased pressure from customers to purchase brass scrap directly from them at the metal buying price could reduce cbcc s ability to take advantage of free market discounts 
as noted above  cbcc s pricing structure consists of the metal selling price and the fabrication price as separate components 
the metal selling price is determined at the time of shipment based on the then current metal buying price and is not directly affected by fluctuations in free market brass scrap prices 
as a result of this pricing structure  increases and decreases in the metal selling price will affect net sales levels and gross profit as a percentage of sales  even in the absence of an increase or decrease in shipments or the fabrication prices charged to customers  but will have little impact on gross profit levels 
however  the quantity of free market brass scrap purchased by cbcc and changes in the difference between the free market prices paid for brass scrap and the metal buying price will affect gross profit  even in the absence of an increase or a decrease in shipments or net sales levels 
in addition to sales made under the pricing structure described above  approximately of pounds sold are made on a tolling basis  where the customer consigns brass scrap to cbcc and is charged a fabrication price for processing the brass scrap into finished rod 
tolling transactions affect net sales by the metal selling price that otherwise would be charged to the customer in a sale of finished brass rod 
to a lesser degree  tolling transactions also affect gross profit to the extent cbcc is unable to take advantage of the pricing differential on brass scrap purchased and sold 
to partially offset the effect of tolling transactions on gross profit  cbcc requires tolling customers to deliver additional pounds of brass scrap in exchange for each pound of finished rod shipped 
leavitt 
leavitt is a leading producer of structural and mechanical electric resistance welded steel tubing in square  rectangular and round shapes in sizes ranging from inch to inch squares and equivalent rectangles and inch to inches in outer diameter for round sizes 
leavitt s financial performance may be impacted by changes in the price it pays for flat rolled steel  the primary cost component of leavitt s finished product  based on the market conditions in the domestic and the international flat rolled steel industry 
based on the then current market conditions in the steel tubing industry and the level of capacity utilization  leavitt may or may not be able to pass the economic impact of steel price changes on to its customers through changes in the selling price 
the steel tubing industry is highly fragmented and suppliers may reduce prices or fail to increase prices as a result of flat rolled steel price increases  depending on their individual financial and operational motivation 
general economic and industry conditions the demand for the company s products in the united states and canada generally is dependent upon business conditions in the industries which use products made from copper alloy rod 
manufacturers of products used in building and construction and manufacturers of industrial machinery and equipment are the primary users of copper alloy rod 
therefore  the company s operating results during any given period depend significantly on business conditions in these industries 
these industries  in turn  are sensitive to fluctuations in overall economic activity  movement in interest rates and availability of short and long term financing 
the company s operating results also depend on its manufacturing capacity  as well as industry production levels and other market factors 
during  united states and canadian apparent consumption of brass rod was approximately billion pounds  which included industry shipments of million pounds plus net imports of approximately million pounds  which was basically flat with apparent consumption 
industry shipments decreased approximately million pounds  or  from billion pounds in  while net imports increased approximately million pounds  or 
fueled by strong demand for brass rod  apparent consumption increased during the period from second half through first half demand and the strong us dollar have increased imports of brass rod 
however  the increasing interest rates through mid and the economic slowdown that began in third quarter have adversely impacted customers in building and construction  transportation  industrial machinery and equipment and distribution industries 
all market segments saw softening in fourth quarter as industry shipments were down and net imports were off as compared to fourth quarter the industry s largest end use market  building and construction  has been impacted by the slowing of new home construction and flattening demand in home remodeling 
since  apparent consumption has fluctuated based on demand  while over the same period  cbcc s shipments have increased  with shipments plateauing over the last three years due to production constraints 
outlook 
consistent with the slowing economy  the company is projecting softening of apparent consumption of brass rod in first half compared with the prior year 
with the forecasted recovery in the overall economy in second half  demand for brass rod should strengthen and by fourth quarter apparent consumption of brass rod should show year over year increases in usage 
forecasts of future industry consumption  future levels of imports and future shipments by the company are forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties  including without limitation those identified below  which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the company s projection of apparent consumption will occur 
actual results and developments in these areas will be affected by the general economic and industry conditions discussed above 
foreign economic activity and the relationship of the us dollar to other currencies also affect import levels and exports of us manufactured products containing parts made from brass rod 
the company s shipments also will be affected by its ability to maintain manufacturing operations at its current levels without significant interruption and successfully implement its capacity expansion program 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the last in  first out lifo basis 
inventories have been written down to lower of cost or market and such amounts are considered cost for subsequent years 
if the first in  first out fifo method for determining cost had been used  inventories would have been approximately million higher at december   and million lower at december  results of operations unaudited  in millions year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold lower of cost or market inventory writedowns gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operation  net of tax estimated loss on disposal  net of tax net income loss compared with net sales increased million  or  to million in net sales increased mainly as a result of a increase in the brass rod metal selling price 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in brass rod shipment pounds 
the shipment gains earlier in the year were offset by a fourth quarter decline 
in the fourth quarter  an economic slowdown adversely impacted incoming order rates from customers across all market segments 
additional discussion on demand was previously discussed above under general economic and industry conditions 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in due to slightly lower unit profit margins and lower brass rod shipments 
increased costs for electricity  natural gas and fuel were partially offset by improved profitability of brass purchased on the open market 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million for the decrease was due to reduced professional and consulting expenses  lower management incentives and decreased franchise taxes  partially offset by higher legal fees in which were mainly due to the bp litigation 
depreciation expense increased by million  or  to million due to the new brass foundry 
as a result of the above factors  operating income increased million  or  to million in net interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the increase was primarily the result of million less capitalized interest expense on the brass rod extrusion and finishing expansion in than on the new brass rod foundry in due to the stage of completion of each project 
as a result of the above factors  income before income taxes increased by million  or  to million in from million in income tax expense decreased by million  or  to million as a result of a reduction in the effective tax rate from in to partially offset by the tax on an increase of million in income before taxes 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily the result of state tax planning initiatives including tax incentives related to cbcc s project capital investment 
in first quarter  the internal revenue service the irs completed an examination of the federal income tax return filed by the company for year ended december  in july  the company received a refund in the amount of million from the irs resulting from the treatment of settled issues for that year 
as a result of the above factors  income from continuing operations increased by million  or  to million or per diluted share  in from million  or per diluted share in income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  decreased to basically break even in from million of income  net of taxes  in leavitt s results decreased in due to lower steel tubing shipments and lower unit margins 
despite higher selling prices  flat rolled steel prices increased more than leavitt was able to pass along to its customers due to competitive pressures  thereby resulting in lower unit margins 
leavitt s results also included a million lower of cost or market inventory writedown 
loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes  was million 
in march  the company signed a definitive sale agreement for the assets and certain liabilities of leavitt tube 
additional discussion on the sale of leavitt was previously discussed above under general sale of leavitt tube 
net loss for was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income for of million  or per diluted share 
compared with net sales decreased million  or  to million in net sales increased mainly as a result of an decrease in the average brass rod metal selling price in compared to cbcc s brass rod shipments were slightly down from the record level 
strong industry demand was predominantly in the industry s largest end use market  plumbing and construction 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in due to improved unit profit margins and million lower of cost or market inventory writedown in due to reductions in the brass metal price 
unit margins improved because of the january and september increase in the difference between the metal selling price and the metal buying price 
sg a expenses increased million  or  to million for the increase was due to higher professional and consulting expenses and increased management incentives 
depreciation expense increased by million  or  to million due to the new brass foundry 
as a result of the above factors  operating income increased million  or  to million in net interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for  primarily as a result of the repayment of long term debt and capitalizing approximately  of interest expense on the construction of the new cbcc brass foundry 
as a result of the above factors  income before income taxes increased by million   to million in from million in income tax expense increased by million  or  to million as a result of the taxes on an increase of million in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rates for and were 
as a result of the above factors  income from continuing operations  increased by million  or  to million  or per diluted share  in from million in or per diluted share 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  was flat in at million of income  net of taxes  with leavitt s results included a million lower of cost or market inventory writedown compared to a million lower of cost or market inventory writedown in the inventory writedowns resulted from declining flat rolled steel prices and lower steel tubing prices 
leavitt s results  excluding the lower of cost or market inventory writedowns  decreased million  or  to million  net of tax  for due to lower steel tubing shipments and lower unit margins 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased by million  or  for to million  or per diluted share  compared with net income for of million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources general at december   long term debt  including current portion  totaled million  a million  or decrease from year end cash and cash equivalents were million at year end  resulting in net debt as of december   of million 
the company currently is meeting its operational and liquidity needs with cash on hand  internally generated funds and amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
working capital at december   working capital was million  a million  or  decrease from million at december  working capital at december   included million receivable from bp and the bp note payable of million and interest accrued on the bp note aggregating million 
these amounts were long term assets and liabilities at december   and were settled in february with a cbcc payment of million to bp 
see further discussion of the bp settlement at note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item excluding the bp related amounts  working capital at december   was million  a million increase from decreases in cash and cash equivalents of million and prepaid expenses of million were offset by an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in current liabilities of million 
accounts receivable remained flat with the prior year despite a reduction in net sales in fourth quarter compared with offsetting this reduction was an increase in the company s accounts receivable days outstanding from the prior year  partially due to certain customers electing not to take advantage of prompt payment discounts in and the slowing of the economy 
the increase in inventory was partially due to an increase in brass rod accumulated in advance of maintenance outages in fourth quarter which was not needed as shipments slowed in fourth quarter additionally  inventory increased due to the timing of brass scrap purchases 
the decrease in current liabilities was the result of the timing of metal purchases and payment of accrued environmental costs 
the company s current ratio follows december  current ratio current ratio excluding cash cash flow provided by operating activities in  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in the primary sources of cash from operating activities in were net income from continuing operations of million  depreciation of million  and a deferred tax expense of million partially offset by an increase in assets and liabilities  excluding cash  debt and deferred taxes of million 
the change in working capital for was explained above in working capital 
in addition to cash provided by continuing operations of million  cash provided by discontinued operations totaled million 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in the primary sources of cash from operating activities in were net income from continuing operations of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a deferred tax expense of million and a reduction in assets and liabilities  excluding cash  debt and deferred taxes of million 
in addition to cash provided by continuing operations of million  cash provided by discontinued operations totaled million 
at december   working capital was million which decreased million from million at december  a decrease in inventory of million  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
the decline in inventory was due to timing of metal receipts and management s efforts to reduce inventory levels 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly due to timing of metal purchases  increased capital expenditures payable due to the status of the foundry project in compared to the billet heater project in  and the accrued environmental costs of million at december  accounts receivable increased primarily due to an increase in net sales in december compared to december in  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million compared with the primary sources of cash from operating activities in were net income from continuing operations of million and depreciation and amortization of million  partially offset by an increase in assets and liabilities  excluding cash  debt and deferred taxes of million 
in addition to cash provided by continuing operations of million  cash provided by discontinued operations totaled million 
at december   working capital was million which increased by million from million at december  an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in inventory of million 
the primary reason for the decrease in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable was the decrease in the brass metal price in cash flow used in investing activities capital expenditures were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures included equipment and construction costs for a second extrusion press and additional finishing lines in  equipment and construction costs for the new cbcc foundry in  and initial costs for the new foundry and installation costs for the three new billet heaters in cash flow used in provided by financing activities during  the company prepaid the remaining million on the term loan as hereinafter defined 
the term loan was paid off in june  three years ahead of schedule 
in addition  the company received million for the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities of million during resulted from stock option exercises 
during  the company prepaid million on the term loan 
net repayments on the revolving credit facility totaled million 
the company also received proceeds of million in conjunction with a lease of new billet heating equipment 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item capital resources in  cbcc launched a capital project referred to as project the project is designed to increase foundry  extrusion and finishing capabilities with an ultimate goal of increasing finished brass rod production capability by one third to approximately million pounds annually 
the first phase of the project was completed in early with the installation of three new billet heaters that increased finished brass rod capacity by about percent 
the new billet heaters have increased productivity and improved quality 
the total cost of the first phase of the project was approximately million and was financed through a six year operating lease 
in second quarter  the company announced phase ii of project  which was a million multi year investment to construct an additional brass foundry enabling cbcc to increase casting capacity and to provide customers with multiple alloys 
the new brass foundry began producing billets on a trial basis in february and is now producing billets at expected production rates 
the new foundry has reduced metal costs and increased production capacity 
the new foundry produced approximately of cbcc s billet requirements in in fourth quarter  the company announced phase iii of project  which was a million multi year investment to purchase a second extrusion press and additional finishing equipment 
when phase iii comes on line  which is expected to occur in  cbcc s production capacity will increase by about one third to more than million pounds annually 
the building housing the finishing lines has been completed and construction of the extrusion press building has begun 
all long lead time equipment has been ordered 
the company anticipates that capital projects will be paid for with cash flows provided by operating activities and the bank credit facility  as necessary 
bank credit facility in connection with the leavitt acquisition  the company entered into a credit facility the bank credit facility of million agented by pnc bank  national association pnc bank 
the bank credit facility originally included a million term loan term loan and a million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility 
prior to second quarter  the company had prepaid all amounts on the term loan originally due through april the remaining balance of million on the term loan was prepaid in second quarter effective september   the company and pnc bank agreed on an amendment to the bank credit facility which increased the revolving credit facility by million  to million 
on september   the company and pnc bank agreed on an extension to august   on the revolving credit facility 
advances under the bank credit facility bear interest at alternative variable rates based on certain percentages  as provided in the agreement  in excess of the lending bank s prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor  with interest payable quarterly or as of the end of each libor borrowing period  whichever is shorter 
there were no borrowings outstanding on the bank credit facility at december  the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was at december  the bank credit facility contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends 
the covenants also require the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and level of net worth and restrict the company from exceeding a maximum ratio of debt to cash flow from operations 
the bank credit facility also requires the company to maintain cbcc and leavitt as wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of december   no amount was outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
total availability under the revolving credit facility was million as of december  average revolving credit facility borrowings the average outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility in and was million 
as of march   the company had available million under the revolving credit facility

contingencies environmental matters as discussed in item business environmental regulation and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item  cbcc is subject to certain contingent liabilities relating to environmental conditions at its manufacturing facility 
cbcc completed remediation activities for a portion of its montpelier  ohio manufacturing facility in at a cost of approximately million  and initiated additional interim remedial actions for other portions of the site in second quarter costs for the remedial actions initiated in originally were estimated at million and were recorded in second quarter based on bp s obligations under the remediation agreement and the cbcc purchase agreement  the company recorded a receivable from bp of million in third quarter for costs related to remediation activities and a million receivable from bp in second quarter for costs related to the remediation activities 
the results of sampling conducted as part of the interim remedial actions initiated in identified the presence of vocs that were not covered by the initial scope of these interim actions 
as a result  cbcc conducted additional sampling of certain areas of the site to further delineate the contamination in those areas 
based on the aggregate sampling results  cbcc modified its remediation plan 
cbcc began implementing the modified plan in first quarter and completed the remediation in fourth quarter at a cost of million including million spent in for this project 
cbcc also is in the process of developing a remediation plan for in situ remediation at two additional areas of its site  and expects to initiate in situ remediation activities at those areas in based on preliminary cost estimates provided by cbcc s independent environmental consultant  and subject to the development by the consultant of a remediation plan for these areas of the site and the receipt of bids for the remediation activities required under such plan  the company estimates that the costs for this project will be approximately million  based upon capital and operating costs for a period of five years 
however  subject to pilot testing and operating experience  costs may increase if a longer operating period is necessary 
based on cost estimates of the remediation activities conducted in and  the company recorded million of environmental reserves of which million was accrued in based on bp s obligations under the remediation agreement  the company recorded a corresponding million receivable from bp 
remediation spending of million in and million in resulted in a reserve of million at december  the reserve included million for the in situ remediation plan  million for environmental consulting  and million for final payments on the remediation activities 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item  claims asserted by the company against bp under the remediation agreement and the cbcc purchase agreement for  among other things  costs incurred and anticipated to be incurred by the company for these environmental remediation activities were settled pursuant to a settlement agreement and mutual release entered into in february based on currently available data  the company believes that  upon completion of the remediation activities described above  cbcc will have substantially completed the remediation activities at its site that are necessary to address contamination of which cbcc currently is aware 
however  until completion of these remedial and associated investigatory activities and receipt of approval from the ohio epa of cbcc s activities to remediate this contamination  as well as remediation activities previously conducted  the company cannot be certain that further remediation activities will not be required at cbcc s site 
to the extent regulatory agencies require additional remediation at those areas of cbcc s site where cbcc previously has undertaken remediation activities  or requires excavation of soil at the two remaining areas for which cbcc currently is developing a remediation plan for in situ remediation  as a part of the settlement of the litigation with bp referred to above  bp has retained financial responsibility for such remediation activities 
the company expects to fund cleanup costs related to the remaining remediation activities at its manufacturing facility with cash on hand and borrowings under its existing bank credit facility 
therefore  the company does not believe that funding these remediation activities will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the statements set forth herein regarding anticipated expenditures for environmental matters are forward looking  are based on sampling results currently available to the company  remediation plans in the process of being developed by independent consultants of cbcc which plans are subject to assumptions regarding applicable cleanup standards and methodologies and preliminary cost estimates for completion of the remediation activities 
actual costs required to be expended by the company with respect to such matters may differ materially from current expectations depending on the final resolution of known uncertainties  including finalization of remediation plans for the two remaining areas of cbcc s site as discussed above  completion of proposed remediation activities  acceptance by applicable governmental agencies of cleanup standards relied upon in developing remediation plans and conducting remediation activities  discovery of additional contaminants during remediation  and any change in cbcc s proposed use of its property which affects any applicable cleanup standard 
contingencies legal proceedings as discussed in item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item  in february the company and cbcc settled a lawsuit with bp  originally filed in january  regarding amounts payable under the bp note 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been significantly affected by inflation
