item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
general the company is a holding company whose subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates own and or operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide related rail services in north america  south america and australia 
the company  through its us industrial switching subsidiary  also provides freight car switching and related services to united states industrial companies with extensive railroad facilities within their complexes 
the company generates revenues primarily from the movement of freight over track owned or operated by its railroads 
the company also generates non freight revenues primarily by providing freight car switching and related rail services such as railcar leasing  railcar repair and storage to industrial companies with extensive railroad facilities within their complexes  to shippers along its lines  and to the class i railroads that connect with its north american lines 
the company s operating expenses include wages and benefits  equipment rents including car hire  purchased services  depreciation and amortization  diesel fuel  casualties and insurance  materials and other expenses 
car hire is a charge paid by a railroad to the owners of railcars used by that railroad in moving freight 
other expenses generally include property and other non income taxes  professional services  communication and data processing costs  and general overhead expense 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one reporting period to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
the company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses such as one time freight moves  customer plant expansions and shut downs  railcar sales  accidents and derailments 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable to other periods 
also  much of the company s growth to date has resulted from acquisitions  joint ventures  and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
most recently  the company  through a owned joint venture  completed an acquisition in western australia in december  and through an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate  began operating a railroad in bolivia in november the company also completed two acquisitions  one in canada and one in mexico  in because of variations in the structure  timing and size of these acquisitions and differences in economics among the company s railroads resulting from differences in the rates and other material terms established through negotiation  the company s results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to its results of operations in other reporting periods 
expansion of operations australia on december   the company  through its newly formed joint venture  australian railroad group pty 
ltd 
arg  completed the acquisition of westrail freight from the government of western australia for approximately million including working capital 
arg is a joint venture owned by the company and by wesfarmers limited  a public corporation based in perth  western australia 
westrail freight is composed of the freight operations of the formerly state owned railroad of western australia 
to complete the acquisition  the company contributed its formerly wholly owned subsidiary  australia southern railroad asr  to arg along with the company s interest in the asia pacific transport consortium aptc a consortium selected to construct and operate the alice springs to darwin railway line in the northern territory of australia 
additionally  the company contributed million of cash to arg while wesfarmers contributed million in cash  including million which represents a long term non interest bearing note to match a similar note due to the company from asr at the date of the transaction 
arg also received million in acquisition debt and million of construction and working capital facilities from bank of america and the australia and new zealand banking group limited 
a portion of the debt was used to refinance approximately million of existing bank debt of asr 
should aptc reach financial close and meet other conditions as specified in the agreement between the company and wesfarmers  the company would receive additional compensation 
to fund its cash investment in arg  the company also completed a private placement of redeemable convertible preferred stock the convertible preferred with the fund iii  lp the fund managed by brown brothers harriman co 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a description of the convertible preferred 
as a direct result of the arg transaction  asr stock options became immediately exercisable by the option holders and  as allowed under the provisions of the stock option plan  the option holders  in lieu of asr stock  were paid an equivalent value in cash  resulting in a million pre tax compensation charge to asr earnings 
the company also recognized a million gain upon the issuance of asr stock to wesfarmers upon the formation of arg as a result of such issuance being at a per share price in excess of the company s book value per share investment in asr 
additionally  due to the deconsolidation of asr  the company recognized a million deferred tax expense resulting from the financial reporting versus tax basis difference in the company s equity investment in arg 
should aptc reach financial close and meet other conditions as specified in the agreement between the company and wesfarmers  additional gains will be reported 
the company accounts for its ownership in arg under the equity method of accounting and therefore deconsolidated asr from its consolidated financial statements as of december  the company reported  in equity earnings in its financial statements from arg for the period of december through december  mexico in august  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  compania de ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa fccm  was awarded a year concession to operate certain railways owned by the state owned mexican rail company ferronales 
fccm also acquired equipment and other assets 
the aggregate purchase price  including acquisition costs  was approximately million pesos  or approximately million at then current exchange rates 
the purchase included rolling stock  an advance payment on track improvements to be completed on the state owned track property  an escrow payment which will be returned to the company upon successful completion of the track improvements  prepaid value added taxes and million in goodwill 
a portion of the purchase price million was also allocated to the year operating license 
as the track improvements have been made  the related costs have been reclassified into the property accounts as leasehold improvements and amortized over the improvements estimated useful life 
pursuant to the acquisition  employee termination payments of million were made to former state employees and approximately employees who the company retained upon acquisition but terminated as part of its plan to reduce operating costs after september  all payments were made during the fourth quarter of and are considered a cost of the acquisition 
the chiapas mayab concession is made up of two separate rail lines 
the chiapas is approximately kilometers miles long and runs between ixtepec in the mexican state of oaxaca  and ciudad hidalgo in the mexican state of chiapas 
principal commodities hauled include cement  corn  petroleum products and various agricultural products 
the mayab extends approximately  kilometers miles from coatzacoalcos in the mexican state of vera cruz  to beyond merida in the mexican state of yucatan 
principal commodities hauled on the line include cement  silica sand and various agricultural products

fccm began operations on september  on december   in conjunction with the refinancing of fccm see note to consolidated financial statements and its parent company  gw servicios  sa de sa servicios  the international finance corporation ifc invested million of equity for a indirect interest in fccm  through its parent company servicios 
the company contributed an additional million and maintains an indirect ownership in fccm 
the company funded million of its new investment with borrowings under its amended credit facility  with the remaining investment funded by the conversion of intercompany advances into permanent capital 
along with its equity investment  ifc received a put option exercisable in to sell its equity stake back to the company 
the put price will be based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the company increases its minority interest expense in the event that the value of the put option exceeds the otherwise minority interest liability 
because the ifc equity stake can be put to the company  the impact of selling the equity stake at a per share price below the company s book value per share investment was recorded directly to paid in capital 
canada on april   the company acquired rail one inc rail one which has a ownership interest in genesee rail one inc gro  thereby increasing the company s ownership of gro to

exercise of the option is contingent on the company s recovery of its capital investment in gro including debt assumed if the company were to sell gro  and upon certain gro income performance measures which have not yet been met 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in million of initial goodwill which is being amortized over years 
the contingent purchase price will be recorded as a component of goodwill at the value of the options issued  if and when such options are exercisable 
effective with this agreement  the operating results of gro have been consolidated within the financial statements of the company  with a minority interest due to another gro shareholder
