item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview gilead sciences  inc gilead or we was incorporated in delaware on june   and is an independent biopharmaceutical company that seeks to provide accelerated solutions for patients and the people who care for them 
we discover  develop  manufacture and commercialize proprietary therapeutics for challenging infectious diseases viral  fungal and bacterial diseases and cancer 
gilead also has expertise in liposomal drug delivery technology 
currently  we market ambisome registered trademark amphotericin b liposome for injection  an antifungal agent  daunoxome registered trademark daunorubicin citrate liposome injection  a drug approved for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma  and vistide registered trademark cidofovir injection for the treatment of cytomegalovirus cmv retinitis 
hoffmann la roche inc markets tamiflu tm oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza  under a collaborative agreement with gilead 
in addition  we are developing products to treat diseases caused by human immunodeficiency virus hiv  hepatitis b virus hbv  bacterial infections and cancer 
on february   gilead completed a two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  to stockholders of record as of february  accordingly  all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to retroactively reflect the split 
in the year ended december   gilead adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on july   gilead entered into a business combination with nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc nexstar 
the business combination has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and the historical consolidated financial statements of gilead for all periods prior to the business combination have been restated to include the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of nexstar 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
gilead s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as under the caption business  including risk factors in part i 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information currently available to gilead  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
ambisome sales 
we rely on sales of ambisome for a significant portion of our operating income 
there are lower priced products that compete with ambisome  a product that was recently approved that will compete with ambisome  and products being developed that could compete with ambisome in the future 
if these other products achieve further market acceptance  or if the products in development become commercially available  revenues from sales of ambisome would likely decrease  resulting in a reduction of operating income 
regulatory process 
the us food and drug administration fda and foreign agencies could reject or limit the commercialization of our products for a number of reasons including if they disagree with the results or designs of our clinical trials  if they believe our products have unacceptable efficacy  toxicity or tolerability  or if they believe our products can not be safely and efficiently manufactured on a commercial basis 
if these agencies reject or limit the commercialization of our products  our financial results would be adversely affected 
the clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products are extremely expensive  and it is difficult for us to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter 
in addition  regulatory agencies could require us to conduct additional unanticipated clinical trials on our products  the cost of which could be substantial 
market acceptance of products 
the ability of our products to achieve and sustain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors  including the receipt and scope of regulatory approvals  the availability of public and private insurance and reimbursement for our products  safety  efficacy  tolerability and cost of our products  and how our products compare to competitive products 
if our products do not achieve and sustain market acceptance  our results of operations will suffer 
tamiflu is in a new class of drugs that represent a new approach to treating the flu 
in order for tamiflu to achieve market acceptance  our marketing partner  hoffmann la roche  inc  must change attitudes toward the treatment of influenza 
collaborations 
we depend on collaborations for the development and commercialization of certain products and for revenue  including the collaboration with hoffmann la roche  inc for sales of tamiflu worldwide and the collaboration with fujisawa healthcare  inc fujisawa for sales of ambisome in the united states and canada 
these collaborations could fail for a number of reasons  including if our partners do not devote sufficient resources to the development  commercialization or marketing of our products  or if disputes arise with our partners 
we will also seek additional collaborations 
if our collaborations fail or if we are unable to establish additional collaborations  our financial results would be adversely affected 
foreign currency fluctuations 
a significant majority of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
we do not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
we do hedge accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies  which minimizes our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected 
uncertain financial results 
we expect that our financial results will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
the fluctuations can be caused by many factors that are beyond our control  including the risk factors listed above 
we have never been profitable on a full year basis and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
results of operations revenues we had total revenue of million for the year  million for the year and million for the year included in total revenue are net product sales  royalty income and contract revenue  including research and development r d collaborations 
net product sales revenue was million for  compared with million for and million for our revenues are primarily derived from sales of ambisome  which represented of total product sales in  of total product sales in and of total product sales in reported sales of ambisome were million in  an increase of over ambisome sales of million in excluding the impact of the decline in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in  sales of ambisome in would have increased 
a significant majority of gilead s product sales is denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
we do hedge accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies  which minimizes our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected 
sales of ambisome were million in the increase in ambisome sales in compared with was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
in  gilead also recognized product sales revenue of million from sales of daunoxome and million from sales of vistide 
in  daunoxome sales were million and vistide sales were million 
in  we reported daunoxome sales of million and vistide sales of million 
we expect combined sales of daunoxome and vistide in the future to decrease slightly compared to levels 
we reported royalty revenue of million in  compared with million in and million in during this three year period  the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of ambisome in the united states by fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with gilead 
during the fourth quarter of  we began recognizing royalty revenues from fujisawa s sales of ambisome in the month following that in which the related product sales occur 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recognized this royalty revenue in the month the sales occurred 
royalty revenue from fujisawa was million in  compared with million in and million in the amount represents royalties from months of fujisawa sales of ambisome 
we also reported royalty revenue of million in related to sales of tamiflu 
tamiflu is an orally administered compound developed to treat and prevent viral influenza in humans 
gilead co developed tamiflu with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
and hoffmann la roche inc collectively  roche 
roche owns the worldwide commercial rights to tamiflu  and is required to pay gilead a royalty on net sales of the product 
in october  the fda approved tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults  and roche began selling the product commercially 
we record royalty revenue from roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the related tamiflu sales occur 
accordingly  gilead began recognizing royalties from tamiflu in the first quarter of we expect tamiflu royalties to increase in as a result of broader market penetration and additional regulatory approvals received during the second half of during that time period tamiflu was approved in the us as a prophylaxis preventive in adults and as a treatment for influenza in children  and approved in japan as a treatment for influenza in adults 
substantially all of the remaining net royalty revenue recognized in  and represents royalties from sales of vistide by pharmacia sa pharmacia outside the united states 
in future periods  royalties from sales of vistide are expected to be relatively flat or decline slightly 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
among other things  sab describes the sec staff s position on the recognition of certain nonrefundable up front fees received in connection with collaboration agreements 
we previously recognized nonrefundable technology access fees received in connection with collaboration agreements as revenue when received or when collectibility was probable  and when the technology had been transferred 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for these fees to recognize them as the related manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or on a straight line basis over the term of the related research and development collaboration  manufacturing or supply arrangement  as appropriate  as this method best matches the effort provided 
we believe the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sab the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was recorded in the fourth quarter of  retroactively effective as of january   as deferred revenue that will be recognized as contract revenue over the remaining term of the research and development  manufacturing or supply arrangements  as appropriate 
for the year ended december   the impact of the cumulative change in accounting principle was to increase the net loss by million 
we recognized additional contract revenue of million in  in accordance with sab  related to up front fees which had been received in prior years 
the million was related to three collaborative arrangements million related to an initial licensing fee from sumitomo  million related to an initial licensing fee from roche  and million related to an initial license fee from pharmacia 
the remaining million of related deferred revenue at december  results from the sumitomo and pharmacia collaborations  and is expected to be recognized as contract revenue over the next twelve years 
there is no remaining deferred revenue related to the roche initial license fee as of december  the pro forma results included in the consolidated statements of operations in part iv reflect amounts that would have been reported if the change in accounting principle had been applied retroactively 
total contract revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in the single most significant source of contract revenue in each of these three years was payments from roche relating to the development of tamiflu under an r d collaboration agreement between gilead and roche 
we recorded contract revenue from roche of million in  million in and million in the million of contract revenue from roche in included million in milestone payments related to roche completing regulatory filings and approvals for tamiflu in the us and japan  million of r d expense reimbursements  and million resulting from the adoption of sab as discussed above 
the amount included million of milestone payments and million of r d reimbursements 
the million recorded during represented reimbursements of r d expenses  and included million attributable to r d expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of  which were subject to roche s approval as of december  such expenses were approved for reimbursement and recognized as revenue in r d reimbursements from roche in decreased compared to  and reimbursements in similarly decreased relative to  as tamiflu development efforts ramp down while roche s commercialization activities increased 
as of december   gilead is entitled to additional milestone payments of up to million upon roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones 
while we may earn milestones payments under the roche agreement in  we expect expense reimbursements under the roche agreement to continue to decline in such reimbursements will approximate our actual related costs incurred 
in march  we entered into an agreement with eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc relating to gilead s proprietary aptamer nx currently in early clinical trials  nx is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf  which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  eyetech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of nx  and  if the product is successfully commercialized  eyetech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product 
eyetech also will be responsible for all research and development costs 
we will provide clinical supplies of the product to eyetech through march we received a million up front licensing fee from eyetech in april  which is being recognized as revenue ratably over the one year supply agreement period 
accordingly  million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue under the agreement in  and the remainder of the license fee will be recognized as revenue in the first quarter of we are also entitled to additional cash payments from eyetech of up to million if and when eyetech reaches certain nx development milestones 
additionally  gilead received a warrant to purchase  shares of eyetech series b convertible preferred stock  exercisable at a price of per share  the price at which the stock was issued to other investors 
we are obligated to transfer of the total shares subject to the warrant to the university of colorado at boulder under a collaborative agreement with the university  and we expect to retain the remaining  shares 
we did not recognize revenue related to the warrant as there was no readily determinable fair value at the time of the transaction 
in november  gilead and somalogic  inc entered into an agreement under which gilead assigned to somalogic a sole and exclusive license to certain intellectual property  including patents and patent applications 
under the terms of the agreement  somalogic was required to pay gilead a total of million in two nonrefundable installments 
the second installment totaled million and was received in november and recorded as contract revenue upon receipt 
the first installment of million was received and recognized as contract revenue in november contract revenue recognized in also included a million performance based milestone payment received from skw americas  inc skw 
skw is the owner of proligo llc proligo  an entity in which we hold the remaining ownership interest 
in  we recorded as contract revenue a million milestone payment from sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
related to a license of ambisome rights in japan 
also in  we entered into an agreement with isis pharmaceuticals  inc isis under which we sold to isis the holdings of our antisense patent estate  including patents and patent applications 
under the terms of the agreement  isis is required to pay gilead a total of million in four installments 
the total sale price of million was included in contract revenue in contract revenue for also includes reimbursement of research expenses under our collaborative agreements with glaxosmithkline  formerly glaxo wellcome inc glaxo and schering ag schering 
under the agreement with schering related to the discovery and development of aptamers as in vivo diagnostic agents schering research agreement  we recognized million of contract revenue in the schering research agreement expired in  but a related license agreement remains in effect 
our collaborative agreement with glaxo was related to its code blocker program 
contract revenue recognized in connection with the glaxo agreement was million in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million in  compared with million in and million in as a percentage of product sales revenue  cost of goods sold was in  in and in in connection with most of our european product sales  we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold payment currencies 
a significant majority of our manufacturing cost is in us dollars 
a decline in the value of the payment currencies relative to the us dollar will negatively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues  which are reported in us dollars  will decline 
in  the gross margin was negatively impacted by these factors  as discussed in the product sales section under the caption revenues above 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates on reported sales revenue  cost of sales as a percentage of sales would have been approximately  down slightly from primarily due to larger production quantities in absorbing our fixed costs 
our cost of sales percentage on an annual basis has been in the to range in recent years 
except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in payment currencies relative to the us dollar  we expect the cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue in to remain materially consistent with the rate 
in future years  changes in the nature or mix of our product sales could impact this relationship 
operating expenses research and development r d expenses for were million  compared with million for and million for major development projects in include tenofovir df for hiv and adefovir dipivoxil for hepatitis b virus hbv 
we incurred increased costs for both of these programs which are in phase iii clinical trials 
additionally  we made up front payments in the fourth quarter of to in license two oncology products from glaxo and southern research institute 
these increases more than offset significantly lower expenses in for the development of adefovir dipivoxil for hiv  a program we discontinued in the fourth quarter of we expect r d expenses in to be approximately to higher than due to increased spending on the continued late stage development of tenofovir df for hiv and adefovir dipivoxil for hbv 
the decrease in r d expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to reduced research activities at our boulder  colorado facility 
in august  we transferred our boulder based nexstar technology products division to proligo  our equity investee 
in addition  in october  we reduced our r d workforce in boulder by employees and recorded an expense of million related to severance packages for the discharged employees 
in  we reduced the r d workforce in boulder by employees upon completing the merger with nexstar 
finally  gilead had a reduced level of involvement in the development of tamiflu in compared to these decreases were offset in part by greater levels of expense in for the development programs for adefovir dipivoxil for hbv and tenofovir df for hiv  as well as an adjustment of million to fully reserve our supply of adefovir dipivoxil for hiv 
this adjustment was made as a result of our decision to discontinue the development of this product candidate in the united states after a negative recommendation from an fda advisory panel 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the major factor contributing to the decrease in from levels was the inclusion in sg a of million of merger related expenses in excluding merger expenses  sg a expenses in were essentially flat compared with higher general and administrative g a expenses in were offset by savings in sales and marketing expenses 
the increased g a spending included costs to implement new and upgraded information technology systems  legal costs incurred in connection with new collaboration agreements and various corporate projects  and expenses to meet general corporate reporting requirements 
sales and marketing expenses in included costs to expand our sales and marketing capacity in anticipation of the then planned commercial launch of adefovir dipivoxil for hiv  which was discontinued in the fourth quarter of additionally  sales and marketing expenses reflect cost savings in the us from the elimination in the second half of of duplicate positions and functions within the combined gilead and nexstar organization 
in  we expect sg a expenses to be to higher than levels  primarily due to the activities necessary to prepare for the anticipated us and european commercial launch of tenofovir df 
the increase in sg a expenses in compared with was due to merger expenses of million 
excluding the merger expenses  sg a spending was flat from to during  we recorded million of compensation expense related to a nexstar stock option plan that requires the use of variable plan accounting 
this charge was substantially offset by cost savings related to the elimination of duplicate selling  general and administrative positions and functions within the combined gilead and nexstar organization in the second half of merger expenses of million are included in total sg a expenses for these expenses primarily consisted of transaction costs  including professional fees  filing fees and printing costs  employee severance costs  and the write down of certain nexstar property and equipment that was not expected to be used in future operations 
total employee severance costs of million relate to the termination of employees  the majority of which were from our boulder  colorado facility 
as of december   all employees for whom severance costs were accrued had been terminated 
the balance of the accrued liability was million at december  and substantially all remaining accrued severance costs were paid to former employees by december  we do not expect to realize any further cost savings resulting from staff reductions that occurred after the merger 
litigation settlement and related expenses we incurred litigation settlement and related expenses of million in  million in and million in we reached a settlement with elan corporation  plc elan  the successor company to the liposome company in which both companies agreed to dismiss all legal proceedings involving ambisome  gilead s liposomal formulation of amphotericin b 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we made an initial payment to elan of million and are required to make additional payments through  based on ambisome sales 
the payments are subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts 
a million accounting charge was recorded in representing the net present value of all future minimum payments we are required to make 
we record an expense each quarter based on the difference between all future minimum payments and the amount previously accrued 
these amounts have not been significant 
we do not expect the difference between the future minimum and maximum payments to elan to be material 
gain on sale of subsidiary in  we recognized a million gain on the sale of our interest in our newly established subsidiary  proligo  a delaware limited liability company  to skw 
proligo was formed in july and initially consisted of the assets of our nexstar technology products division  a manufacturer of oligonucleotides and specialty chemicals for the pharmaceuticals industry 
as payment for the sale of our interest in proligo  we received million and a interest in perseptive biosystems gmbh  a company in hamburg  germany  which specializes in the manufacture of nucleoside phosphoramidite monomers 
in addition  skw agreed to pay us million in guaranteed payments and up to million in performance based milestones through as part of the transaction  we contributed million and our interest in perseptive biosystems gmbh to proligo 
the interest in perseptive biosystems gmbh had a fair value of approximately million 
skw contributed million and the remaining of perseptive biosystems to proligo 
interest income and interest expense we reported interest income of million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in over was due to higher interest rates on our investment portfolio  as well as slightly higher average balances of invested funds 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was due to both a declining balance of invested cash as well as slightly lower investment returns in we expect interest income in to increase from levels due to higher cash balances as a result of our million convertible subordinated notes financing completed in december we incurred interest expense of million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in from occurred primarily because we incurred interest expense on our convertible debentures only through august   when they were converted to common stock 
interest expense on other debt  including capital leases  decreased also  due to continually declining outstanding balances as we repay the debt 
this decrease  however  was offset by interest on our new million convertible subordinated notes issued in december interest expense decreased in compared to primarily due to the repayment of debt obligations including capital leases 
we expect interest expense in to increase to approximately three times the expense level as we incur a full year of expense on the million convertible subordinated notes 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate in  gilead recorded million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate  proligo 
this represented our share of proligo s loss for the thirteen month period ended december  during the fourth quarter of  proligo changed its fiscal year end to december from november for  we recorded million equity in the loss of proligo for proligo s fiscal year ended november  in  we recorded million as our equity in the loss of proligo for the period from august  proligo s inception date through november  we expect to continue to recognize losses on our equity investment in proligo during our investment in proligo is reported in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
the carrying amount of this investment was million at december  and million at december  in the three year period ended december   we funded proligo with a total of million to maintain our percentage ownership interest in proligo 
we have no further commitments to provide additional funding to proligo  and we do not expect to provide any 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december   up from million at december  the increase of million was due to the net proceeds of million from our million convertible subordinated notes financing in december other major sources and uses of cash included proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans  offset by cash used to fund operating activities and capital expenditures 
significant changes in working capital during included an increase in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses of million  primarily due to the advanced and accelerated phase iii clinical trials for tenofovir df for hiv and adefovir dipivoxil for hbv 
other accrued liabilities increased million in  the largest component of which was an unrealized loss on foreign exchange contracts of million at december  this unrealized loss was partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains on accounts receivable balances at that date  however the gain on receivables is included in the accounts receivable balance on the balance sheet 
other components of the increase in other accrued liabilities during included higher marketing accruals and various other accruals due to the timing of invoice receipts  and higher foreign tax liabilities primarily in italy 
another significant change in working capital in was an increase in accounts payable of approximately million  primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the growth was primarily due to increased receivable balances in countries in which payments tend to be relatively slow 
in certain cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
this  in turn  may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers 
in certain countries in which payments have been slow  particularly greece  spain and italy  our accounts receivable are significant 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  spain and italy totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
at december   past due receivables for these countries was million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
to date  we have experienced only modest losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that the past due accounts receivable for greece  spain and italy are collectible 
we continually seek to improve our collection process to ensure that we fully collect amounts due to us based on our product sales and that collections are timely 
other noncurrent assets increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to million of long term prepaid royalties recorded in the fourth quarter of related to payments made to iocb rega 
these prepayments will be amortized to royalty expense over the expected commercial life of tenofovir df and adefovir dipivoxil when and if fda approval is obtained and sales of the products commence 
also included in other noncurrent assets at december  is million of deferred debt issuance costs related to the million convertible subordinated notes financing completed in december these costs are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the notes 
these increases in other noncurrent assets were offset by a million decrease due to a receivable from isis related to a payment due to us in december this balance was reclassified to current assets as of december  additionally  other noncurrent assets as of december  included deferred debt issuance costs of million related to our subordinated debentures which were converted to common stock in august  these costs were reclassified to additional paid in capital upon the conversion 
long term deferred revenue at december  is million 
this balance represents up front payments received under two collaboration agreements that are being recognized as contract revenue over the life of the related research and development collaboration  manufacturing or supply arrangement 
upon our adoption of sab effective january   a total of million of previously recognized contract revenue was recorded as deferred revenue  of which million was recognized as contract revenue in we made capital expenditures of million in  million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth  as well as for laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
we expect our capital spending to continue at the level or higher in the future  particularly to accommodate our expanded research and development activities 
in august  we redeemed our convertible subordinated debentures at a cash price of  per  principal amount of debentures outstanding  plus accrued interest  which was the redemption price provided for in the original debentures indenture 
upon redemption  the entire million in principal amount of the debentures outstanding at that time was converted into  newly issued shares of gilead common stock by august  deferred debt issuance costs of million related to the debentures were charged to additional paid in capital in connection with the conversion of the debentures into common stock 
on december   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december  in a private offering 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to  shares of gilead common stock at per share 
the conversion price was higher than our common stock price at the notes issuance date 
the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  at any time on or after december   at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest 
debt issuance costs of million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets  and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes 
we maintain a million unsecured line of credit that bears interest at a floating rate with a major financial institution 
under the terms of the line of credit  we are required to maintain certain financial ratios and there are limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or to engage in certain significant transactions 
the line of credit  which includes a foreign exchange facility  expires on april  we currently do not intend to renew this line when it expires  but we will maintain the foreign exchange facility 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by net product revenues and contract and royalty revenues  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we were entitled to additional cash payments of up to million from roche if and when roche achieves specific additional tamiflu developmental and regulatory milestones 
we are also entitled to additional cash payments from eyetech of up to million if and when eyetech reaches certain nx development milestones 
we cannot assure you that any of these milestones will be met 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of our products under development  the commercial performance of ambisome and any of our products in development that receive marketing approval  administrative expenses  the status of competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements  the expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  our possible geographic expansion  and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners 
if such funding is required  we can not assure you that it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
prospective accounting pronouncement statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  is effective for gilead as of january  the standards require that we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as  and meets the definition of  a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as  and meets the definition of  a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately 
sfas also requires warrants to purchase capital stock of a non public company which include a net settlement feature to be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value  with an offsetting amount recorded in the results of operations 
the fair value of the warrants are required to be remeasured at each balance sheet date  with changes in the fair value of the warrants recorded in results of operations 
we have cash flow hedges and warrants in private companies with a net settlement feature covered by sfas upon adoption of sfas on january   we will recognize an aggregate credit to results of operations  recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle  of approximately million  an increase in net assets of approximately million  and an increase in other comprehensive income of approximately million 
market risk disclosures foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states as well as sales activities in europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable 
additionally  to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  the contracts have maturities of one year or less with one exception 
one hedge contract intended to hedge raw materials purchases in the first quarter of  with a notional amount of million and fair value of million  has a maturity of months

with respect to the investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on maturity  industry group  investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return
