seasonality and quarterly results the company currently will sponsor major annual racing events in sanctioned by nascar  including ten winston cup and seven busch grand national series racing events 
the company will also sponsor three irl racing events  one cart racing event  three nascar craftsman truck series racing events  four major nhra racing events  seven woo racing events  and three udtra pro dirt car series racing events 
as a result  the company s business has been  and is expected to remain  highly seasonal 
in and  the company s second and fourth quarters accounted for and  respectively  of its total annual revenues and and  respectively  of its total annual operating income 
the company sometimes produces minimal operating income or losses during its third quarter when it hosts only one major nascar race weekend 
in  the company s operating results for the first and third quarters were significantly impacted by the additional racing events held at lvms 
the concentration of racing events in the second quarter  and the growth in the company s operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to increase operating losses or minimize operating income in future first and third quarters 
racing schedules may be changed from time to time and can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of the company s motorsports business 
the more significant racing schedule changes that have occurred during the last three years include the following lvms hosted an irl racing event in the second quarter of which  along with a nascar craftsman truck series racing event  was held in the third quarter of also in the second quarter of  lvms hosted an inaugural nhra nationals racing event  and bms  lmsc and tms hosted inaugural woo and hat racing events 
in the third quarter of  ams hosted an irl racing event under a restructured sanctioning agreement whereby net event results are included in event related revenue 
in the third quarter of  revenues and expenses associated with the irl event are included in admissions and event related revenues and direct expense of events

the cumulative effect of the accounting change reduced fiscal year net income by  after income taxes  and is reflected below as of january  in the first quarter of the pro forma amounts for fiscal year reflected below have been adjusted for the effect of retroactive application of the accounting change on net membership fee revenues  and related income taxes  had the new method been in effect for the periods presented

fiscal will be the company s first year under the multi year consolidated domestic television broadcast and ancillary rights agreements for nascar winston cup and busch grand national series events 
these new agreements are expected to provide the company with future increases in contracted broadcasting and other ancillary revenues 
total combined revenues under the domestic broadcast and ancillary rights agreements could approximate up to million in  representing a million increase over while economic conditions and competitive racing can affect ticket sales  management believes ticket demand should continue to grow 
however  to help bolster fan interest in challenging economic conditions  management has decided not to increase many ticket and concession prices at least for significant factors in spr concession contract rights resolution 
in november  the company acquired certain tangible and intangible assets and the operations of sears point raceway 
at that time  a third party enjoyed the contract rights to provide event food  beverage and souvenir merchandising services at spr whose original contract was to expire in the company s subsidiary finish line events has provided such services since in september  the company reacquired such contract rights for approximately million  including legal and other transaction costs 
because fair value was not readily ascertainable until reaching final agreement in september  the contract rights were not reflected in spr s original purchase price allocation nor recorded until their value was established 
management anticipates the present value of estimated net future benefits under the contract rights will exceed its costs 
notwithstanding this expected future benefit  their cost has been reflected as a current period expense because acquisition was beyond accounting principles board opinion no

smi intends to defend itself and denies the allegations of negligence as well as related claims for punitive damages 
management does not believe the outcome of this lawsuit will have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position or future results of operations 
other significant factors in fiscal the operating results for fiscal  and more specifically the three months ended december   were negatively impacted by less than expected attendance and event related revenues at several of the company s major racing events due to a convergence of uncontrollable factors including poor weather and an early substantial lead in and winning of the winston cup series point race 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically met its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and other debt and equity offerings 
the company expended significant amounts of cash in for improvements and expansion at its speedway facilities 
significant changes in the company s financial condition and liquidity during resulted primarily from net cash generated by operations amounting to million  capital expenditures amounting to million  and reducing outstanding borrowings under the credit facility by million with proceeds from the sale of the lvms industrial park  and reducing outstanding convertible subordinated debentures by million 
cash flows from operations in were negatively impacted by a decrease in deferred race event income of million between december  and due primarily to changes in billing and payment terms of advance ticket sales and suites rentals and slower ticket sales for the upcoming racing season 
at december   the company had million in outstanding borrowings under the million credit facility 
management anticipates that cash from operations  and funds available through the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating needs through  including planned capital expenditures at its speedway facilities 
based upon anticipated future growth and financing requirements  management expects that the company will  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
the company may  from time to time  redeem or retire convertible subordinated debentures and other debt  and purchase its other securities  depending on liquidity  prevailing market conditions  as well as such factors as permissibility under the credit facility  the senior subordinated notes  and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
while the company expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from its existing speedway operations  and has generally experienced improvement in its financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  such resources  as well as possibly others  could be needed to fund the company s continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of its speedway facilities 
capital expenditures significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
therefore  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements in its facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
in  ams continued improving and expanding its on site roads and available parking and made other site improvements 
in  the company added approximately  permanent seats at bms   at lmsc  and  at lvms  all featuring stadium style premium seating 
at bms  lmsc and lvms  the company further expanded concessions  restroom and other fan amenities  and made other site improvements 
also  lmsc and tms completed construction of mile  modern  lighted  dirt track facilities 
lvms also completed reconstruction and expansion of one of its dragstrips into a state of the art dragway with permanent grandstand seating  luxury suites  and extensive fan amenities and facilities 
in  the company plans to continue major renovations at spr  including its ongoing reconfiguration and modernization into a stadium style road racing course  adding up to  new grandstand seats   new hillside terrace seats  and new luxury suites 
also  spr plans to continue improving and expanding its on site roads and available parking  and reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow 
in  tms plans to convert approximately suites to speedway club style seating areas 
although these suites are currently unleased  management believes excess demand for premium seating and services at tms s largest events exceeds current availability  and that conversion will generate additional operating profits 
similar to  the company plans to further expand concessions  restroom and other fan amenities for the convenience  comfort and enjoyment of fans  and to continue improving and expanding its on site roads and available parking to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at each of its speedways in the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in will approximate million 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at the company s facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in the design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from the company s estimates if the company s assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially affect the ultimate cost 
in addition to expansion and improvements of its existing speedway facilities and business operations  the company is continually evaluating new opportunities that will add value for the company s stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of its existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets and the expansion into complementary businesses 
dividends the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
any decision concerning the payment of dividends on the common stock will depend upon the results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans of the company  as well as such factors as permissibility under the credit facility  the senior subordinated notes and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the credit facility and senior subordinated notes preclude the payment of any dividends 
recently issued accounting standards the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as of january  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires  among other things  that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
because the company does not have any derivative instruments  adoption is expected to have no effect on the company s financial statements or disclosures 
the company periodically evaluates the possible effects of sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information on its financial statement disclosures 
the combined operations of the company s speedways comprise one operating segment  and encompass all admissions and event related revenues and associated expenses 
other company operations presently are not significant relative to those of the speedways 
as such  at this time  sfas no 
continues to have no effect on the company s financial statement disclosures 
environmental matters the company s property at lmsc includes areas that were used as solid waste landfills for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the lmsc property ceased in there is one lcid landfill currently being permitted at lmsc  however  to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities  and one lcid landfill that was closed in two other lcid landfills on the lmsc property were closed in lmsc intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the lmsc property in the future 
prior to  lmsc leased certain lmsc property to allied waste industries  inc for use as c d landfill  which can receive solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but cannot receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
in addition  allied waste industries owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to lmsc 
management believes that the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
management also believes that the company s operations  including the landfills and facilities on its property  are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
management is not aware of any situations related to landfill operations which it expects would materially adversely affect the company s financial position or future results of operations
