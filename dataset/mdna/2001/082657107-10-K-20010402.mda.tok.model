results of operations fiscal year ended december  versus fiscal year ended december  the registrant reported net sales of  and a net loss of  or 
per basic and diluted common share for the fiscal year ended december  compared to net sales of  and a net loss of  or 
per basic and diluted common share in the prior year 
the registrant s spanish subsidiaries  laboratorios belmac sa and laboratorios davur sl  reported an increase in net sales of in local currency for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the prior year  however  a decline in the value of the spanish peseta and related euro negatively impacted net sales by  resulting in net sales generated in spain of  when expressed in us dollars 
net sales were also impacted in the third and fourth quarters by increased generic drug competition that has reduced sales of certain of the registrant s branded pharmaceutical products 
the registrant expects generic competitive pressure to continue to impact sales of its branded pharmaceutical products that are subject to generic competition  which may result in lower sales until the registrant s generic drug products can capture sufficient market share to offset this impact 
the registrant anticipated the opportunities that the emerging generic drug market in spain present and began taking measures over two years ago to enter the spanish generic drug market 
the registrant  through its wholly owned spanish subsidiaries  began to register  market and distribute generic pharmaceutical products in spain and began aligning its business model to be competitive in this arena  including hiring and training a new generic product sales force  submission of generic equivalent products to the spanish ministry of health for approval and a marketing campaign designed to position the registrant as a leader in the spanish generic drug market 
also impacting revenues was a decision by the spanish ministry of health to suspend from commercialization a class of drugs that included finedal  a product previously marketed by the registrant 
the registrant s net sales for the fiscal year ended december  included sales of finedal totaling approximately  while net sales for the fiscal year ended december  included finedal sales of approximately  the registrant does not anticipate any future sales of this product nor does it anticipate incurring any future costs with respect to this product 
net sales for the fiscal year ended december  include  related to research and licensing agreements and fees derived from research and product formulation activities performed in the united states 
gross margins  which declined modestly in the most recent quarter  for the fiscal year ended december  increased to compared to gross margins of in the prior year  primarily as a result of the mix of products sold and manufacturing efficiencies realized at the manufacturing facility during the fiscal year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the ministry of health and the pharma industry in spain had entered into a two year agreement that expired in december  whereby pharmaceutical companies in spain  including the registrant s spanish subsidiaries  were taxed on their growth as a vehicle for funding rising health care costs in spain 
a new agreement was reached in march  which did not have a significant impact on the results of operations for the year ended december  however  this tax is expected to result in slightly lower gross margins for the year ending december  the registrant entered into a strategic alliance with teva pharmaceutical industries  ltd 
in july  whereby the registrant  through its spanish subsidiaries  will receive licenses for more than of teva s products for registration and marketing in spain 
the products will be comprised of both branded and generic forms 
an investment in additional sales representatives will be required  along with an increase in regulatory activities  both of which may create a short term reduction in the registrant s earnings 
the registrant  through its subsidiary  laboratorios davur  has also submitted registrations to the spanish ministry of health for generic versions of various products  in response to growing interest in generic products in spain 
the price of a generic product is typically lower than the price for the comparable branded product  consequently  the registrant believes that resulting gross margins may be lower on sales of such products 
the registrant s decision to enter the generic market was based on its objectives to remain competitive and to grow sales and market share 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from of net sales to of net sales as a result of the registrant s decrease in net sales and its efforts to control general and administrative expenses 
a significant portion or  during of these expenses are selling and marketing expenses  which are necessary for the registrant to maintain and grow sales and market share in spain 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  or over the same period of the prior year  and as a percent of net sales  increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses  as reported in us dollars  were approximately  lower than would have been reported as a result of the decline in the value of the spanish peseta and related euro in relation to the us dollar during the period 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from  in the year ended december  to  in the fiscal year ended december  however  as a percentage of net sales  such expenses increased slightly from of fiscal year net sales to of fiscal year net sales 
general and administrative expenses  as reported in us dollars  were approximately  lower than would have been reported as a result of the decline in the value of the spanish peseta and related euro in relation to the us dollar during the period

the registrant reported research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
amounts charged to research and development totaled  for the year ended december  and were offset by  as a result of a negotiated reduction in an amount previously accrued for research and development expenses

this laboratory is being used by the registrant to develop potential product applications using its permeation enhancement technology 
the limited expenditures in research and development reflect the registrant s continued de emphasis of basic research and redirection of its resources to developmental expenses necessary for expansion of its portfolio of marketed products 
the registrant intends to continue to carefully manage its research and development expenditures in order to ensure that its development programs are efficient and cost effective 
depreciation and amortization expenses totaled  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  for the prior year

the registrant incurred first quarter interest expense related to its senior subordinated debentures of approximately  which was eliminated beginning in the second quarter of  as a result of the conversion of all debentures into shares of common stock

cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k which are not historical facts contain forward looking information with respect to plans  projections or future performance of the registrant  the occurrence of which involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the registrant s actual results to differ materially from those expected by the registrant 
see certain risk factors listed in item business risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
a substantial amount of the registrant s business is conducted in europe and is therefore influenced by the extent to which there are fluctuations in the dollar s value against other currencies  specifically the euro and the peseta 
on january   the euro became the official currency of european union eu member states with a fixed conversion rate against their national currencies 
the value of the euro against the dollar and all other currencies  including those of the four eu member states that are not participating in the euro zone  will fluctuate according to market conditions 
although euro notes and coins will not appear until january   the new currency has been used by consumers  retailers  companies and public administrations since january   in the form of written money  ie by means of checks  traveler s checks  bank transfers  credit card transactions  etc 
the permanent value of one euro in spain is fixed at pesetas 
the exchange rate at december  and was and pesetas per us dollar  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate for the years ended december  and was and pesetas per us dollar  respectively 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on long lived assets for the year ended december  was a decrease of  and the cumulative historical effect was a decrease of  as reflected in the registrant s consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
although exchange rates fluctuated significantly in recent years  and in particular  the weakening of the euro in relation to the us dollar in  the registrant does not believe that the effect of foreign currency fluctuation is material to the registrant s results of operations as the expenses related to much of the registrant s foreign currency revenues are in the same currency as such revenues 
however  the carrying value of assets and reported values can be materially impacted by foreign currency translation  as can the translated amounts of revenues and expenses 
nonetheless  the registrant does not plan to modify its business practices 
the registrant has relied primarily upon financing activities to fund the operations of the registrant in the united states 
in the event that the registrant is required to fund united states operations or cash needs with funds generated in spain  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on the registrant 
however  at the present time  the registrant does not anticipate altering its business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations 
the weighted average interest rate on the registrant s short term borrowings is and the balance outstanding is  as of december  the weighted average interest rate on the registrant s long term borrowings is also and the balance outstanding is  the effect of an increase in the interest rate of one hundred basis points to on short term borrowings and long term borrowings would have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately  annually
