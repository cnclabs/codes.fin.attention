each outstanding option of brhz and cfam was converted into an option to purchase shares of common stock at the same conversion ratios referenced above 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and tax free reorganization 
all historical equity amounts have been restated to reflect the respective exchange ratios  and certain reclassifications have been made for consistent presentation  which had no effect on net income 
in april the company assumed the operation of three child care centers for the us navy in guam 
additionally  in may the company acquired nurseryworks limited  based in london  england  which operates nine child care centers in the greater london area 
finally  in december the company acquired circle of friends  based in ireland  which operates two child care centers 
the operations of the company s non domestic child care centers are not material to the company s operating results  financial position or cash flows 
center economics 
the company s revenue is principally derived from the operation of family centers  and to a lesser extent  other services including consulting services 
family center revenues consist of parent fees for tuition  amounts paid or contributed by sponsors to fund a portion of a family center s operating costs  and management fees paid by client sponsors 
revenue growth has primarily resulted from the addition of new family centers as well as increased enrollment and tuition and expanded programs at existing family centers 
parent fees comprise the largest component of a center s revenue and are billed on a monthly or weekly basis  payable in advance 
the parent fees are generally comparable to or slightly higher than prevailing area market rates for tuition 
amounts paid by sponsor clients are payable monthly and may be dependent on a number of factors such as enrollment  the center s operating costs  budgeted amounts  and the extent to which the sponsor wishes to subsidize parent fees 
management fees are generally fixed and payable monthly 
although the specifics of the company s sponsorship arrangements vary widely  there are two basic forms  the sponsor model and the management model 
the company employs the sponsor model in approximately of its family center sites 
under the sponsor model  a family center is operated at or near the sponsor s work site 
the company retains profit and loss responsibility for the operation of the family center  and  as part of the arrangement  may receive financial support from the sponsor 
client support can take various forms  including reduced occupancy costs  tuition assistance and start up and or operating cost assistance 
newly opened sponsored centers generally operate at a loss until utilization levels reach approximately  which typically occurs within to months of operation 
in exchange for client sponsorship  the company gives priority enrollment to the children of employees or tenants affiliated with the sponsor 
under the management model  which comprises approximately of the company s operating sites  the company operates a family center under a cost plus agreement 
these contracts generally include a management fee and require that the sponsor provide an operating subsidy for operating expenses in excess of parent fees or tuition within an agreed upon budget 
therefore  the company does not sustain pre opening or initial operating losses under the management model 
the management model centers experience slightly lower operating margins than the sponsor model centers at full maturity 
under the sponsor model  the tuition paid by parents is supplemented in some cases by direct payments from sponsors and  to a far lesser extent  direct payment from government agencies 
under the management model  in addition to parent tuition  revenue also includes management fees and operating subsidies 
tuition  management fees and fees for priority enrollment rights paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned 
in centers operating under the sponsor model  the company may be required to make capital expenditures necessary to initially fit out  equip and furnish the family centers  as well as make similar expenditures to refurbish and maintain existing centers 
while sponsors generally provide for the space or construction of the family center  the company may pay for leasehold improvements or construction costs 
the company may make capital investments when it is able to obtain favorable purchase terms or when a sponsor agrees to pay fees in advance for long term priority enrollment rights in the center  or for other guarantees 
in centers operating under the management model  the sponsor typically provides for all costs associated with building  fitting out  equipping  furnishing and supplying the family center 
the sponsor is also typically responsible for ongoing occupancy and maintenance costs 
in addition to the sponsor and management models  the company may establish a center in instances where it has been unable to cultivate sponsorship  or sponsorship opportunities do not currently exist 
in these instances the company will typically lease space in locations where experience and demographics indicate that demand for the company s services exist 
these centers typically operate at a loss until utilization levels reach approximately  which typically occurs within to months of operation 
cost of services expenses consist of direct expenses associated with the operation of family centers and with the delivery of consulting services 
family center cost of services consist primarily of staff salaries  taxes and benefits  food costs  program supplies and materials  parent marketing  and occupancy costs 
personnel costs are the largest component of a family center s operating costs  and comprise approximately of a family center s operating expenses 
however  personnel costs will be proportionately larger in family centers operating under the management model and proportionally lower in family centers operating under the sponsor model 
consulting cost of services are comprised primarily of staff salaries  taxes and benefits  contract labor  and other direct operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries  taxes and benefits for non center personnel  including corporate  regional and business development personnel  accounting and legal fees  information technology  occupancy costs for corporate and regional personnel and other general corporate expenses 
amortization expense is being recognized over the period benefited by certain intangible assets  which include goodwill  non compete agreements and contract rights associated with acquisitions made by the company 
new centers 
in fiscal year  the company added new family centers  of which are operating under the sponsor model and of which are operating under the management model 
in the same period  the company closed centers that were either not meeting operating objectives or transitioned to other service providers 
the company currently has over centers under development  scheduled to open over the next to months 
the opening of new centers is subject to a number of conditions and factors  including  among others  construction timing  sponsor needs and weather conditions 
seasonality 
the company s business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
demand for child care and early education services has historically decreased during the summer months 
during this season  families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements 
demand for the company s services generally increases in september upon the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the school year 
results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the performance of existing centers including enrollment and staffing fluctuations  the number and timing of new center openings and or acquisitions  the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability  center closings  refurbishment or relocation  the model mix sponsor vs 
management of new and existing centers  the timing and level of sponsorship payments  competitive factors and general economic conditions

the company s primary source of liquidity has been from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings available under the company s various credit arrangements 
the company had a working capital deficit of million at december  and working capital of million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was primarily the result of an in increase in net income before depreciation and amortization of million

cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal year  as compared to cash used by financing activities of million in the increase was primarily the result of net borrowings of million under its million line of credit which was executed march  in fiscal year cash used by financing activities was primarily the result of the company s repurchase of  shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
during fiscal years  and  the company received  and million  respectively  in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in fiscal year these proceeds were partially offset by the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock  which were subsequently reissued to fulfill warrant and stock option exercises 
on july   the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock  which was subsequently increased to a total of  shares on october  at december  the company had repurchased  shares for a total of million 
share repurchases under the stock repurchase program will be made from time to time with the company s cash in accordance with applicable securities regulations in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the actual number of shares purchased and cash used  as well as the timing of purchases and the prices paid  will depend on future market conditions 
the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist primarily of high quality commercial paper and institutional money market accounts 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates market value due to their short maturities 
management believes that funds provided by operations and the company s existing cash and cash equivalent balances and borrowings available under lines of credit will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
however  if the company were to make any significant acquisitions or make significant investments in the purchase of facilities for new or existing family centers  it may be necessary for the company to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms  if at all 
new pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the results of its operations or financial position 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no

market risk foreign currency risk 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily the result of foreign subsidiaries domiciled in the united kingdom and ireland 
the company does not currently use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its european subsidiaries 
the assets and liabilities of the company s united kingdom and irish subsidiaries  whose functional currencies are the british pound and irish pound  respectively  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
the cumulative translation effects for the subsidiaries are included in cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders equity 
the operations of the company s united kingdom and irish subsidiaries are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  the impact of a change in the exchange rate would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
interest rate risk 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of institutional money market funds  which due to their short maturities are considered cash equivalents 
the company s primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
these investments  which approximate million  have an average interest rate of approximately and are subject to interest rate risk 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points in fiscal year  the company s interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the decrease would have occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on the company s future interest income as a result of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of the company s investments 
the company is also subject to interest rate risk under the terms of its various lines of credit  which have variable rates of interest 
the impact on the company s future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of the company s borrowings 
management estimates that had the average interest rate incurred on the company s average borrowings under its lines of credit increased by basis points in fiscal year  the company s interest expense for the year ended december  would have increased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the increase would have occurred on the first day of borrowings and increased the rate charged by basis points 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operation 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
