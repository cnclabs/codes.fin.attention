results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos cerebral oximeter  the only non invasive patient monitoring system commercially available in the united states that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen level in the brain 
we are also developing the correstore tm patch  which is being developed for use in heart surgeries called surgical anterior ventricular restoration  or savr 
in october  we obtained fda clearance for new advances in our invos technology that are incorporated in our model cerebral oximeter 
the model cerebral oximeter was introduced in october and we began shipping the model in the first quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we introduced our new model cerebral oximeter at an international trade show  and began international shipments of the model in august the model has the added capability of being able to monitor pediatric patients 
in september  we received clearance from the fda to market the model cerebral oximeter in the united states 
in june  we entered into a license agreement for the correstore tm patch  which requires testing and fda clearance or approval before we can sell it in the united states 
during fiscal   and  our primary activities consisted of sales and marketing of the cerebral oximeter and related disposable somasensor 
we had an accumulated deficit of  through november  we believe that our accumulated deficit will continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
we derive our revenues from sales of cerebral oximeters and somasensors to our distributors and to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales employees 
we recognize revenues when we ship our products to distributors or to hospitals 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our primary expenses  excluding the cost of our products  are selling  general and administrative and research  development and engineering  which we generally expense as incurred 
from may through the first quarter of fiscal  we exchanged model a cerebral oximeters for our model cerebral oximeters 
until shipments of the model cerebral oximeter began in the first quarter of fiscal  we refurbished the model cerebral oximeters we received and sold them approximately at cost in countries that do not require compliance with the standards met by the model a 
during fiscal  we offered to exchange model cerebral oximeters for model a cerebral oximeters which we then scrapped and cash equal to the difference in sales prices of the two models 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we offered the same exchange of model cerebral oximeters for model a cerebral oximeters to baxter limited in japan  as a result of the japanese ministry of health and welfare approval in the first quarter of fiscal to market the model in japan 
such sales reduce our average unit sales price and overall gross margin 
also  during fiscal  we began a no cap sales program whereby we ship the model cerebral oximeter to the customer at no charge  in exchange for the customer agreeing to purchase at a premium a minimum monthly quantity of somasensors 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in international sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to the stocking orders for model and model cerebral oximeters and somasensors by nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  and an increase in united states sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to increased purchases of the disposable somasensor 
the increase in net revenues was achieved despite decreased purchases of the model by baxter limited in japan attributable to the initial stocking purchases and exchange purchases made in fiscal as a result of japanese ministry of health and welfare approval in fiscal to market the model in japan  an decrease in the average selling price of cerebral oximeters primarily as a result of the stocking orders from nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  at lower per unit prices  for use as demonstration equipment by its sales personnel  and a change in the sales mix in the united states between direct purchases of the model and no cap placements of the model  and a decrease in the average selling price of somasensors primarily as a result of the initial stocking orders from nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  at lower per unit prices  for use as demonstration equipment by its sales personnel 
approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal sales of somasensors  model cerebral oximeters  model cerebral oximeters  and model exchanges as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors model cerebral oximeters model cerebral oximeters model exchanges total two international distributors accounted for approximately and  respectively  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november   and one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november  effective january   we increased the price of the model somasensor by 
this price increase does not apply to any existing sales quotations which were issued before january  in addition  the suggested retail price of the model cerebral oximeter is approximately higher than the model gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  although we realized a lower average selling price for cerebral oximeters and somasensors in fiscal  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to shipments of our new model somasensor in fiscal  which is less costly to manufacture than the old model somasensors 
the new model somasensor was sold for the entire year in fiscal  as compared to fiscal when it was launched and was sold primarily in the second half of the year 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a  decrease in consulting fees associated with the termination of our consulting order with neurophysics corporation  and a  decrease in costs associated with enhancements to the design of the disposable somasensor 
these decreases were achieved despite a  increase in costs associated with the development of the correstore tm patch  and a  increase in engineering salaries 
we expect our research  development and engineering expenses to increase significantly in connection with development and clinical testing of the correstore tm patch in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  decrease in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of employees  principally sales and marketing  from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and reduced sales commissions  a  decrease in trade show expenditures during fiscal  a  decrease in professional service fees primarily as a result of decreased business consulting fees during fiscal  and a  decrease in employee severance during fiscal these decreases were incurred despite a  realized loss on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal  a  increase in selling related expenses  primarily related to marketing and promotional materials  travel  and training related to our new distribution agreement with nellcor puritan bennett export  inc  and other employee travel expenses  a  increase in intangible amortization expense related to the amortization of license acquisition costs  and a  increase in clinical research expenses  primarily related to the model cerebral oximeter 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily due to an approximately  increase in united states sales  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  and an approximately  increase in international sales  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal these increases are primarily due to increased purchases of the disposable somasensor  purchases of the model cerebral oximeter by baxter limited as a result of japanese ministry of health and welfare approval in the first quarter of fiscal to market the model in japan  a increase in the average selling price of cerebral oximeters  primarily due to the march  increase in the price of the cerebral oximeter and fewer no cap and exchange unit sales in fiscal  and an increase in the average selling price of the disposable somasensor  due to the effects of no cap sales and the march  increase in somasensor prices 
approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately in fiscal sales of model cerebral oximeters  somasensors  model exchanges  model cerebral oximeters  and model a cerebral oximeters as a percent of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenues product model cerebral oximeters somasensors model exchanges model cerebral oximeters model a cerebral oximeters total one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues in fiscal  and one united states distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the higher average selling prices we realized for the model cerebral oximeter and the somasensor  increased shipments of our new model somasensor  which is less costly to manufacture than old model somasensors  and a smaller percentage of model exchanges in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a higher percentage of our net revenues derived from the sale of somasensors in fiscal  which still have lower margins than cerebral oximeters 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease is primarily due to approximately  in decreased costs associated with enhancements to the model  and  in decreased consulting fees 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in costs associated with enhancements to the design of the disposable somasensor 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal is primarily due to a  increase in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of increased sales commissions we paid to our sales force during fiscal  and a  increase in professional service and investor relations fees 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in selling related expenses  primarily attributable to employee travel  industry trade shows  marketing and advertising  and a  decrease in bad debts expense for fiscal effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations during fiscal was approximately  cash was used primarily to fund our net loss  including selling  general and administrative expenses and research  development and engineering expenses  totaling approximately  before depreciation and amortization expense  increase accounts receivable by approximately  primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal than in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increase other assets by approximately  as a result of professional service fees capitalized as part of our license acquisition costs 
we expect our working capital requirements to increase if sales increase 
we capitalized approximately  of costs for model and model cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration units and no cap units during fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal we expect to depreciate these costs over three years 
capital expenditures in fiscal were approximately  these expenditures were primarily for the costs for model and model demonstration and no cap cerebral oximeters described above 
we expect our capital requirements to increase as a result of the costs of developing and testing the correstore tm patch 
our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity investments from sales of our common shares 
see statements of shareholders equity of our financial statements included in item of this report 
on april   we completed the public offering of  newly issued common shares  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  through an offering underwritten by brean murray co  inc our net proceeds  after deducting the underwriting discount and the expenses of the offering  were approximately  on march   we entered into the private equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited  a private institutional investor 
pursuant to the private equity line agreement we may issue and sell  from time to time  common shares for cash consideration up to an aggregate of million 
as required by the private equity line agreement  we have filed a registration statement to permit kingsbridge to resell to the public  of the shares that we sell to it pursuant to the private equity line agreement 
until march   we may sell  or put  common shares to kingsbridge from time to time in amounts and at times we select at our discretion  subject to specific restrictions set forth in the private equity line agreement 
the price for these sales is between and of the then current average market price of our common shares 
the actual percentage will depend on an average market price of our common shares 
in addition  we must pay brean murray co  inc a commission in connection with these sales 
we must also pay additional expenses in connection with these sales 
we are not permitted to sell more than of our outstanding common shares pursuant to this arrangement unless we first obtain shareholder approval under the nasdaq smallcap market rules 
we are seeking shareholder approval at the annual meeting of shareholders to issue up to  common shares pursuant to the arrangement  including the common shares already issued 
puts can be made every trading days in amounts ranging from a minimum of  to a maximum of  the amounts depend on the then current trading volume and average market price of our common shares at the time of each put 
we are required to put at least  of our common shares to kingsbridge over the life of the private equity line agreement or pay kingsbridge the discount on the unsold shares 
as of november   we had issued  common shares under the private equity line agreement 
under the private equity line agreement  the average market price of our common shares for purposes of calculating the purchase price to be paid by kingsbridge is the average of the lowest trade prices of the common shares as reported by bloomberg lp on each of five days on which the nasdaq smallcap market is open for trading 
the five days are the two trading days before the day on which we deliver notice to kingsbridge that we are exercising a put  the trading day on which we deliver the put notice  and the two trading days after the trading day on which we deliver the put notice 
the private equity line agreement provides that we may not put our common shares to kingsbridge unless the following conditions are satisfied or waived none of which is within kingsbridge s control the registration statement must have been declared effective by the sec and must remain effective  the representations and warranties made by us in the private equity line agreement must be accurate in all material respects as of the date of each put and as of the date of the closing of the sale 
one of our representations is that since november  there has been no material adverse change in our business  operations  properties  prospects or financial condition  except as disclosed in the registration statement or specified periodic reports filed with the sec pursuant to the securities exchange act of  we must have performed and complied with in all material respects all obligations under the private equity line agreement  the warrant and the registration rights agreement entered into between us and kingsbridge in connection with the private equity line agreement that are required to be performed as of the date of each put and as of the date of the closing of the sale  no statute  rule  regulation  executive order  decree  ruling or injunction may be in effect that prohibits or directly and adversely affects any of the transactions contemplated by the private equity line agreement  our common shares must not have been delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market nor suspended from trading  the issuance of the common shares must not violate the shareholder approval requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  the number of shares to be put to kingsbridge  together with any shares then held by kingsbridge  must not exceed of our common shares that would be outstanding upon completion of the put  and the average trading volume of our common shares for of the consecutive trading days immediately preceding a put must be at least  shares a day 
the two highest and the two lowest trading volume days are excluded 
in consideration for kingsbridge s commitment under the private equity line agreement  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge on march  the warrant entitles the holder to purchase  common shares at a purchase price of per share 
the warrant is exercisable at any time until september  the warrant contains standard provisions that protect the holder against dilution by adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable pursuant to the warrant if any of the following occurs stock split reverse stock split  stock dividend  reclassification  merger  statutory share exchange  similar transactions affecting our common shares  or specified issuances of common shares  convertible or exchangeable securities  options and warrants at less than the market price of the common shares  as defined in the private equity line agreement 
the warrant also provides for adjustments if we pay liquidating dividends 
no adjustments are required for instruments or benefits issued under any of our stock option plans or in consideration of our acquisition of all or any part of the assets of another person 
the exercise price of the warrant is payable either in cash or by a cashless exercise in which the number of common shares underlying the warrant having an aggregate fair market value at the time of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price are cancelled as payment of the exercise price 
we have completed the following sales of common shares under the private equity line agreement on april   we completed the sale of  common shares to kingsbridge  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  on may   we completed the sale of  common shares to kingsbridge  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of on june   we completed the sale of  common shares to kingsbridge  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  on november   we completed the sale of  common shares to kingsbridge  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  our net proceeds  after deducting the commissions and the estimated expenses of the offerings  were approximately  as of november   we had working capital of  cash and cash equivalents of  total current liabilities of  and shareholders equity of  we expect that our primary needs for liquidity in fiscal will be to fund our losses and sustain our operations  including funding marketing costs for the cerebral oximeter  and research and development efforts related to development and testing of the correstore tm patch  product line extensions of the cerebral oximeter for use on newborns  other non brain tissue applications  and enhancements to the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  and for working capital  including increased accounts receivable and inventories of components and sales units to satisfy expected sales orders 
in addition  we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily for new demonstration and no cap equipment and manufacturing tooling for the cerebral oximeter and somasensor 
we are currently working with the inventors to design and execute the preliminary and definitive clinical test necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the correstore tm patch  including fda clearance and ce certification 
we currently believe that the correstore tm patch is eligible to seek k clearance to market the product in the united states 
if human clinical trials are required by the fda  we will have to file ide applications with the fda before beginning the human clinical trials 
however  the fda could require a pma application  which would require significantly more time and expense 
assuming the fda requires k clearance and not pma approval  and human clinical trials are not required  we expect the process of development  testing  application  clearance and preparing to manufacture the product to take approximately one year and to cost us approximately  if the k process requires human clinical trials  we expect the process of development  testing  application  clearance and preparing to manufacture the product to take approximately two years and to cost us approximately  to  if pma approval is required  the time and cost of development  testing  application  clearance and preparing to manufacture the product could be significantly greater 
these expenditures will require us to raise additional capital 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at november   together with the estimated net proceeds from the sales of the then remaining  common shares over time to kingsbridge capital limited pursuant to the private equity line agreement based on current market prices  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements through february by that time we will be required to raise additional cash either through additional sales of our products  through sales of securities  by incurring indebtedness or by some combination of these alternatives 
if we are unable to raise additional cash by that time  we will be required to reduce or discontinue our operations 
the estimated length of time current cash and cash equivalents will sustain our operations is based on estimates and assumptions we have made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to change as a result of actual experience 
changes in the market price or trading volume of our common shares could reduce the proceeds we receive for selling those common shares under the private equity line agreement  decrease the number of shares we can sell in a particular period or both 
actual capital requirements necessary to market the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  to develop and test the correstore tm patch  to undertake other product development activities  and for working capital might be substantially greater than current estimates 
we do not believe that product sales will be sufficient to fund our operations in fiscal as of november   we had  redeemable warrants outstanding exercisable at per share until april  these warrants were issued in our april regulation s securities offering 
the conditions permitting us to redeem these warrants have not been met as of january  in addition  the placement agents in that offering and their transferees hold warrants to purchase  common shares exercisable at per share until april  also  the underwriter of the june public offering and its transferees received warrants to purchase  common shares exercisable at per share until may  in addition  kingsbridge capital limited received warrants to purchase  common shares exercisable at per share until september  pursuant to the private equity line agreement described above 
also  correstore  llc and its agent  wolfe company  received warrants to purchase  common shares exercisable at per share until june  pursuant to the correstore tm license agreement  and  subject to shareholder approval  when specified events occur we agreed to issue them five year warrants to purchase an additional  common shares exercisable at per share pursuant to the correstore tm license agreement  we are seeking shareholder approval for the issuance of these warrants and shares at our annual meeting of shareholders 
it is unlikely that these warrants will be exercised if the exercise price exceeds the market price of the common shares 
we are also party to the private equity line agreement described above 
on december   we completed the sale of  common shares to kingsbridge  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  under the private equity line agreement 
we may sell up to an aggregate of  more of our common shares under the private equity line agreement 
however  we must obtain shareholder approval and register under the securities act of any common shares we sell pursuant to the private equity line agreement beyond the remaining  already registered common shares 
we are seeking shareholder approval at the annual meeting of shareholders to issue up to  common shares pursuant to this arrangement  including the common shares already issued 
we are considering various capital raising alternatives  including a private placement or public offering of newly issued debt or equity securities 
final terms and conditions of any offering may be subject to  among other things  the satisfactory completion by an underwriter or placement agent of such inquiry and investigation of the transaction and of us as they may deem appropriate  and a determination that there has been no material adverse change in the conditions in the markets for the offering or the financial markets generally 
in addition  the type and amount of securities  if any  that might ultimately be issued in any such offering have not yet been determined and will be dependent on negotiations with the underwriter  any private placement investor  market conditions and our then current estimate of the proceeds necessary or desired to sustain our operations 
there can be no assurance that such offering will occur or that we will be able to raise any capital or capital in amounts we desire  or on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
we have no loan commitments 
even if we receive additional capital  we might not be able to achieve the level of sales necessary to sustain our operations  and we will incur the costs of developing and testing the correstore tm patch before we realize any revenues from the patch 
we might not be able to obtain any funds on terms acceptable to us and at times required by us through sales of our products  sales of securities or loans in sufficient quantities 
our independent auditors report contains an explanatory paragraph relating to the uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern 
see independent auditors report accompanying the financial statements in item of this report 
our ability to use our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income  if any  for income tax purposes  is limited due to the initial public offering of our securities in march see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report
