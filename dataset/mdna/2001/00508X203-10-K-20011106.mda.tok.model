background of the spin off transaction during  applied power s management began to consider the separation of the electronics business from the industrial business as  among other things  a way to more effectively pursue strategic opportunities in the electronics market 
ultimately  it determined that the separation of the two businesses in the form of a spin off was the preferred option 
on january   applied power s board of directors authorized various actions intended to position applied power to distribute the electronics business to its shareholders in the form of a special dividend 
the distribution took place on july  actuant now trades separately on the nyse under the ticker symbol atu and apw ltd

fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the majority of this decline is due to the impact of businesses divested in fiscal after removing the impact of the divestitures  net sales decreased million  or 
this decrease results from the negative impact of currency rate changes on translated results of million and slower economic conditions  which impacted many of our businesses 
sales to recreational vehicle rv  automotive and truck oems  as well as the construction and diy markets  were all lower than in fiscal due to less favorable economic conditions 
excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  tools supplies net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decline 
the negative impact of currency on translated results accounted for million of the million reduction  with the remainder being caused by generally weak economic conditions 
engineered solutions net sales  excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  declined million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal foreign currency rate changes caused million of the decrease 
sales to the rv industry decreased million  which is comprised of a decline of million in power gear rv sales  offset by million of sales from dewald  an rv business we acquired at the beginning of the third quarter 
rv industry demand was negatively impacted by weak economic conditions  as well as a reduction in excess finished goods inventory at oems 
sales to automotive and truck manufacturers declined million due to automotive model changeovers and generally less favorable economic conditions in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction results from the divestiture or removal of the non continuing businesses during fiscal  and the negative impact of foreign currency rate changes on translated results 
partially offsetting these factors were increased shipments by the company in a number of markets  most notably into the recreational vehicle  automotive convertible top and truck cab tilt markets 
fiscal sales from non continuing businesses were million higher than in fiscal primarily due to the timing of the divestitures of such businesses during fiscal excluding the non continuing businesses  adjusted net sales increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding currency translation adjusted net sales increased by approximately 
tools supplies segment sales decreased by from million to million as a result of the foreign currency rate changes and the divestiture of the segment s non continuing businesses 
excluding the impact of the non continuing businesses  tools supplies sales were essentially unchanged year over year 
excluding both currency rate changes and the non continuing businesses  sales from this segment grew million  or 
this organic growth resulted from improved sales of industrial high force hydraulic tools  most notably in north america and asia 
sales in the engineered solutions segment declined from million to million due to the segment s non continuing businesses and foreign currency translation 
sales in this segment grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  excluding the non continuing businesses  reflecting solid growth in sales to the rv  truck cab tilt and automotive convertible top markets 
foreign currency translation had the impact of reducing the constant dollar sales growth in the engineered solutions segment by approximately million  due to the softness of the euro against the us dollar 
excluding both foreign currency translation and the non continuing businesses  engineered solutions segment sales grew 
gross profit the following table summarizes gross profit and gross profit margins for the past three fiscal years year ended august in millions gross profit by segment tools supplies less non continuing t s businesses adjusted tools supplies engineered solutions less non continuing es businesses adjusted engineered solutions total gross profit less non continuing businesses total adjusted gross profit gross profit margins by segment tools supplies adjusted tools supplies engineered solutions adjusted engineered solutions total gross profit margin total adjusted gross profit margin fiscal compared to fiscal total gross profit decreased million  or  from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to reduced sales volumes resulting from divestitures and weaker economic conditions 
excluding non continuing businesses  gross profit declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit margins declined due to an unfavorable change in sales mix to lower margin businesses such as dewald and the unfavorable currency impact of inventory produced in the united states and sold in europe 
these declines were partially offset by improved margins in the electrical tools and supplies business due to cost reductions 
gross profit decreased million  or  in the tools supplies business  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the non continuing tools supplies business  gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit margins improved to in fiscal the gross profit decrease is due to the corresponding decrease in net sales levels 
the gross profit margin increase is due to cost reduction efforts in fiscal engineered solutions fiscal gross profit decreased from fiscal as a result of divestitures  lower sales levels and sales mix 
excluding the non continuing businesses  gross profit decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal adjusted gross profit margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is largely due to increased sales from lower margin businesses  such as dewald 
margins at dewald have improved in the months since the acquisition  and should continue to improve through the realization of results from our world class performance initiatives 
as a result of reduced rv slide out and leveling systems in fiscal due to lower demand  our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs declined  adversely impacting gross profit margins in power gear 
in addition to reduced gross profit margins in power gear  margins have declined in our more vertically integrated businesses  nielson sessions and milwaukee cylinder  as sales have declined due to the economic slowdown 
fiscal compared to fiscal total gross profit decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to a corresponding reduction in sales volume resulting from divestitures 
excluding the non continuing businesses  gross profit increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal total adjusted gross profit margin increased from to 
gross profit for tools supplies decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline results from the corresponding sales reduction in the segment  caused by foreign currency and the segment s non continuing businesses 
excluding the non continuing businesses  gross profit was essentially unchanged  while gross profit margins decreased from to 
engineered solutions gross profit decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a corresponding decline in sales resulting from divestitures 
excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  adjusted engineered solutions gross profit increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and gross profit margin increased from to 
these improvements reflect additional sales volume and the benefits of restructuring actions  including the full year impact of closing our former pewaukee  wisconsin plant and outsourcing certain machining and other manufacturing from our plant in mexico to third party providers 
operating expenses the following table summarizes operating expenses for the past three fiscal years year ended august in millions operating expenses engineering  selling and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets contract termination costs recovery corporate reorganization expense restructuring charge totaling operating expenses sae expenses the following table summarizes our sae expenses for the past three fiscal years year ended august in millions sae expenses by segment tools supplies less non continuing t s businesses adjusted tools supplies engineered solutions less non continuing es businesses adjusted engineered solutions combined segment sae expenses general corporate expenses total sae expenses less non continuing businesses total adjusted sae expenses all of the general corporate expenses incurred by actuant corporation are included in sae expense 
no portion of such expense has been allocated to the electronics business financial results  which are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of lower corporate expense required to support the business following the distribution  corporate expense decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total sae expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was due to the elimination of sae costs incurred by businesses divested in fiscal and the reduction in general corporate expenses discussed above  offset by slight increases in sae costs in both of our business segments 
sae expense for the tools supplies segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  sae expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is a result of higher levels of information technology costs associated with a new business software system and increased marketing spending for tradeshows and promotions 
engineered solutions sae expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the impact of the segment s non continuing businesses  sae expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is due to higher spending on new platform development costs associated with the convertible top product line and the inclusion of sae expense from dewald  which was acquired on march  fiscal compared to fiscal total sae expenses decreased by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the non continuing businesses  adjusted sae expenses decreased by million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the reported sae expense for both and include general corporate expenses in excess of the amounts the company spent subsequent to the distribution 
sae expenses for tools supplies decreased by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  tools supplies adjusted sae expenses decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal tools supplies adjusted sae expenses as a percentage of sales  declined from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement reflects the continuing benefits of earlier restructuring initiatives  including the combination of enerpac s and gardner bender s wisconsin based and canadian based sales and administrative offices 
sae expenses for engineered solutions decreased by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  adjusted sae expenses for engineered solutions decreased by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due primarily to the benefits obtained from cost reduction initiatives  including significant headcount reductions at our domestic automotive unit 
engineered solutions adjusted sae expenses as a percentage of sales  declined from in fiscal to in fiscal amortization of intangible assets the following table summarizes amortization of intangible assets for the past three fiscal years year ended august  in millions total amortization expense less non continuing businesses total adjusted amortization expense the decreases in amortization expense for fiscal and primarily resulted from the divestiture of the barry controls and air cargo equipment business units during fiscal on september  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

contract termination costs recovery operating expenses in fiscal include a million pre tax charge due to the cancellation of a customer contract 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million gain when it recognized recoveries of these contract costs in excess of what was anticipated when the loss was initially recorded 
corporate reorganization expense operating expenses for fiscal include a million pre tax charge for investment banking  legal  accounting and other fees and expenses associated with the distribution 
restructuring costs the company adopted plans to restructure portions of its operations during these plans are designed to reduce administrative and operational costs and resulted in a charge of million 
of the charge  million related to the consolidation of the rv slide production facilities  related to downsizing the cable tie production facility  and million related to other personnel reductions 
the company wrote down the fixed assets at the locations to be closed or downsized to their fair value  less costs to sell  in the third quarter 
the company expects net cash proceeds of approximately million from the ultimate disposal of these assets  which should be completed by the end of fiscal as a result of these plans  the company either has or will soon be terminating approximately people 
other expense income net financing costs actuant reported net financing costs from continuing operations of million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in the company s financing costs is a result of higher interest rates and debt levels as a result of the distribution 
for example  the company s senior subordinated notes carry a interest rate compared to under the prior financing agreements 
during fiscal  these cost increases were partially mitigated as the company benefited  on its variable rate debt  from interest rate reductions in the marketplace 
the debt balances on the company s balance sheet primarily result from acquisitions of business units for the electronics business during the three years prior to the distribution  with some small industrial business acquisitions 
for further information on our current debt structure see liquidity and capital resources later in this management s discussion and analysis and note  debt in our financial statements

income tax expense our effective income tax rate for fiscal is  which is similar to the prior two fiscal years 
the company s income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  our ability to utilize various tax credits  the amount of non deductible expenses and other items

liquidity and capital resources the company generated cash from operating activities of continuing operations of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
operating cash flows were impacted by the discontinuance of the accounts receivable financing program in fiscal due to the distribution and the subsequent sale of receivables in fiscal these changes in our accounts receivable program impacted operating cash flows by million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities of discontinued operations were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities of continuing operations were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  which resulted from cash inflows from business unit divestitures  asset sales  and an insurance settlement  offset by capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
during fiscal  cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of debt repayments 
prior to the distribution  we used the majority of our net cash generated from both continuing and discontinued operations  along with proceeds from borrowings  to acquire businesses 
the majority of the acquisitions were businesses included in the electronics business 
subsequent to the distribution we have used the majority of our net cash generated to pay down debt 
debt the following table summarizes our debt balances at august  and fiscal is not presented as the majority of the borrowings that existed at august  have been refinanced as a result of the distribution 
august  in thousands senior secured debt   senior subordinated notes  net of discount   european term loan  other   total debt   the company is focused on debt reduction 
in the thirteen months since the distribution  our total debt has been reduced by million 
during fiscal debt was reduced million 
the company plans to use the majority of cash provided from operations to fund capital expenditures and reduce debt 
in an effort to reduce financing costs and outstanding debt  in may the company sold certain domestic trade accounts receivable in a securitization transaction 
all proceeds from the sale  which totaled million  were used to reduce debt 
in addition  two businesses were sold during the fiscal year  which produced cash of million  all of which was used to reduce debt 
although focused on debt reduction  when strategic opportunities exist to grow our core business through acquisitions  debt may be incurred 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company borrowed million to fund the dewald acquisition 
all of the reduction in the company s debt has taken place in its senior secured credit facility  which was reduced over from million on august  to million on august  although the company s senior subordinated notes are more expensive from a borrowing cost perspective  there are significant prepayment penalties 
we are continually reviewing alternatives and options to further reduce the company s financing costs  including redeeming  or refinancing all or portions of existing debt  or renegotiating the terms of agreements underlying such debt obligations 
we believe such actions will lower financing costs and correspondingly increase the company s earnings and financial flexibility in the future 
dividend payments have not been made in fiscal  nor do we expect to pay dividends in the near future  so that cash flow from operations can be used to reduce debt 
at august   approximately million of the million of unused revolver capacity was available to the company for general business purposes  and the company was in compliance with all covenants under its debt agreements 
the company believes that availability under its credit facilities  plus funds generated from operations  will be adequate to meet operating  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
seasonality and working capital the company has historically met its working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under revolving credit facilities 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
the largest single customer generated approximately of fiscal net sales 
as described in note  accounts receivable financing in notes to consolidated financial statements  we have sold trade accounts receivables to a special purpose entity that sold participation interests in such receivables to a third party 
when receivables are sold they are removed from the balance sheet 
prior to the distribution  the receivables financing program was discontinued 
as a result  our trade accounts receivable balance increased at august  relative to what has historically been reported 
a new accounts receivable securitization facility was put in place and utilized in may capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing operations consist of the assembly of components that are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
historical capital expenditures were as follows year ended august  in millions total capital expenditures less non continuing businesses adjusted capital expenditures capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows  and are anticipated to continue to be so in the future 
for each of the past three fiscal years  capital expenditures were invested primarily in machinery and equipment and computer systems 
there are no significant capital programs planned in the near future that would require expenditures in excess of the average capital expenditure levels over the past three years 
raw material costs and inflation no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations 
we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin summarizes certain views of the sec staff on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sec staff expressed its view that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires all derivative instruments to be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
the change in fair value of a derivative is required to be recorded each period in net earnings and other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and if so  the type of hedge transaction 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which was adopted during fiscal the impact of adopting eitf no 
was to increase revenues and cost of sales by approximately million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively  with no impact on gross profit  operating profit  or net earnings 
we have reclassified all years presented in the accompanying financial statements to reflect this change 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides for the elimination of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations with an acquisition date of july  or later 
sfas no 
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires periodic reassessment of the underlying value of such assets for impairment 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  an early adoption provision exists for companies with fiscal years beginning after march  on september   the company adopted sfas no 
application of the nonamortization provision of sfas no 
is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact of the transitional provisions of the statement 
european economic monetary union on january   eleven european union countries including a number of the countries where actuant locations operate adopted the euro as their common currency  resulting in fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
the euro presently trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
following the introduction of the euro  the legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries during the transition through january  beginning on january   the european central bank will issue euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy bills and currencies and use the euro as their legal currency 
some of our operating units located in europe  which are affected by the euro conversion  have maintained their books in their respective legacy currency through august  at this time  we do not expect the consequences of the ongoing euro conversion to have any material adverse effects on the company s operations  business or financial condition 
outlook excluding any future acquisitions or divestitures  we believe our revenues for fiscal will range from million to million  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda will range from million to million  and earnings per share will range from to per diluted share 
this compares to fiscal revenues and ebitda  excluding non continuing businesses and non recurring items  of million and million  respectively 
the company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately  lower than that recorded in fiscal due to lower debt and interest costs which allow for higher utilization of foreign tax credits and the impact of the non amortization of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets for book purposes 
we anticipate debt reduction during fiscal of million  excluding the impact of any divestitures or acquisitions  and subject to the achievement of our operating earnings estimate 
these estimates are dependent on  among other things  economic conditions during  foreign exchange and interest rates remaining at their present levels  and the successful implementation of the restructuring program initiated in may in addition  the full impact on our fiscal results of the terrorist actions that took place on september  are not known to us at this time 
you should also refer to the risk factors listed in the form s filed in connection with the exchange offer for our senior subordinated notes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures established by our board of directors  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note  debt 
currency risk we have significant international operations 
in most instances  our products are produced at manufacturing facilities located near the customer 
as a result  significant volumes of finished goods are manufactured in countries for sale into those markets 
for goods purchased from our other affiliates  we denominate the transaction in the functional currency of the producing operation 
we have adopted the following guidelines to manage our foreign exchange exposures i increase the predictability of costs associated with goods whose purchase price is not denominated in the functional currency of the buyer  ii minimize the cost of hedging through the use of naturally offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  netting  and pooling  and iii where possible  sell product in the functional currency of the producing operation 
our identifiable foreign exchange exposures result primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers along with the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
we identify naturally occurring offsetting positions and then purchase hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
our financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables  receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk given our leverage  we are exposed to interest rate risk from changes in interest rates 
we have periodically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk 
at august  we were a party to a variable to fixed interest rate swap  and subsequent to our fiscal year end we entered into a second variable to fixed interest rate swap 
our senior credit agreement stipulates that the lower of of our total debt or million be fixed interest rate obligations 
we are in compliance with this requirement
