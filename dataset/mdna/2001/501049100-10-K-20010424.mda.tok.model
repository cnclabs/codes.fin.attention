the contract  which began in  resulted in higher levels of production and net sales due to an aggressive delivery schedule required by the us air force 
in  kroll o gara s military product sales were based on two new contracts for and up armored hmmwvs  which did not provide for an aggressive delivery schedule 
also included in net sales for the security products and services group are sales of commercial armoring products and security services  which decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales for commercial armoring products of million  or  from million in to million in due to a lag between completing a large us government contract in the first quarter of and beginning a new contract during the third quarter of in  net sales of commercial armoring products were driven by production under this contract to produce armored vehicles 
partially offsetting the decrease in net sales of commercial armoring products was an increase in net sales for security services of million  or  from million in to million in the increase in net sales for security services was primarily the result of continued growth of the group s driver training operations in investigations and intelligence group 
net sales for the investigations and intelligence group increased million  or  from million in to million in a portion of this increase was a result of the buchler phillips acquisition completed for the group in the second quarter of excluding purchase acquisitions  sales increased million

net sales from the domestic business investigations and intelligence practice increased million  or  from million in to million in  excluding acquisitions 
net sales related to corporate services increased million  or  from million in to million in  excluding acquisitions 
the group experienced slower net sales in the fourth quarter of due to a general softening in investment banking transactions 
information security group 
net sales for the information security group decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in net sales was primarily the result of kroll o gara s sale of preferred stock related to this entity in october net sales subsequent to the private equity offering are excluded from kroll o gara s results of operations 
see note to the notes to financial statements for more information on the sale of preferred stock by the information security group 
cost of sales and gross profit

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for and  respectively 
gross margins for the security products and services group decreased approximately percentage points from in to in in the second quarter of  new vehicle models caused additional costs as prototypes for the new models had to be completed before full production could begin 
all prototype costs were expensed as incurred 
in  there were minimal prototype expenses 
in addition  in the third quarter of  the security products and services group elected to take a physical inventory at the end of the period in anticipation of the separation of kroll o gara and also took steps to ensure the integrity of data for the reimplementation of its enterprise system 
these efforts  as well as the recognition of higher overhead costs due to lower production in the period  resulted in total additional costs of approximately million 
these costs negatively affected cost of goods sold and consequently the gross profit margin 
the decrease in production was primarily due to a lag between completing one us government contract at the end of the first quarter of and beginning a new contract during the third quarter of production under the new contract was lower than anticipated in the fourth quarter due to delays in obtaining key components and raw materials  which negatively affected the gross profit margins in the fourth quarter 
gross margin decreased approximately percentage points from in to in for the investigations and intelligence group 
the decrease in gross margin was due to increased fixed costs associated with increased employee compensation and benefits as well as increased subcontractor fees associated with generating professional fee revenue 
gross margin for the information security group decreased from in to a negative in gross margin was negatively impacted in by a continuing focus on development of this group s service capabilities and an increase in professional personnel to support the establishment of a firm customer base

in the third quarter of  the investigations and intelligence group recovered approximately million of a previously written off bad debt which offset a portion of the group s bad debt expense recognized in in  slow customer payments prompted kroll o gara s investigations and intelligence group to increase its reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
in addition  operating expenses in the information security group increased million as a result of the continuing focus on development of this group s software products capabilities  including an increase in professional and support personnel to support the increased development 
as a percent of net sales  operating expenses  before non recurring charges  increased from in to in as mentioned previously  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily was attributable to increased fixed costs to develop the information security group s software products capabilities and to the increases related to depreciation  amortization and bad debt expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was the result of increased borrowings on kroll o gara s revolving credit facility

provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in in comparison with million in the effective tax rates for the periods were in and in in  kroll o gara recorded tax expense despite the pre tax loss incurred from operations 
the tax provision resulted from the non deductibility of certain expenses  including the failed separation costs and the litigation settlement with the us department of justice  and from income in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
additionally  certain domestic and foreign entities realized losses in from which kroll o gara was not able to benefit for tax purposes 
a valuation allowance related to all of these net operating loss carryforwards was provided for in discontinued operations 
the loss from operations of the discontinued voice and data communications group increased from million in to million in this increase was due to an increase in the group s inventory reserve resulting from excess stock of technologically outdated telecommunications equipment as well as an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts due to slow paying customers 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the future realizability of the tax benefit associated with the voice and data communication group s losses  management concluded that a valuation allowance for the entire tax benefit was required in both and in addition  management estimated a loss on disposal of million which includes the estimated future results of operations through the estimated date of the shutdown 
major components of the estimated loss on disposal include a writedown of related goodwill and other asset balances of million and estimated severance  operating and shutdown costs of million

in addition  kroll o gara continued work on a previous contract with the us military for up armored hmmwvs through july of the combination of production on the two contracts as well as an aggressive delivery schedule required by the us air force relating to the contract resulted in unusually high levels of production and net sales in also included in net sales for the security products and services group are sales of commercial armoring products and services  which increased million  or  from million in to million in increases in net sales for security services accounted for the increase in commercial net sales as these services increased million  or  for the year ended december  in comparison with the increase in net sales of security services was primarily the result of increased sales associated with the introduction of driver training operations in texas and mexico in investigations and intelligence group 
net sales for the investigations and intelligence group increased million  or  from million in to million in a substantial portion of this increase was a result of the acquisitions of lindquist avey  inphoto  corplex  fact finders  holder and buchler phillips 
these acquisitions increased kroll o gara s presence in asia  europe and latin america and strengthened the business investigations and analysis and financial services practices on a global scale 
excluding net sales reported by these acquired entities  net sales increased million  or  from million to million in this increase primarily stemmed from internal growth in the group s corporate services practices

gross margins for the security products and services group were and in and  respectively 
gross margin increased as a result of a planned shift in sales mix in the security products and services group s domestic operations to increased commercial armoring sales and military spare parts sales  both of which have higher margins 
however  this gross margin increase was almost completely offset by poor gross margin performance experienced in all foreign operations as a result of competitive pricing pressures and pricing concessions necessitated by foreign economic conditions 
a transition to higher levels of armoring in latin and south america also slowed sales and required some inventory writeoffs 
additionally  currency devaluations in south america hurt margins and slowed sales 
gross margins for the investigations and intelligence group were and in and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin was primarily a result of the acquisition of buchler phillips which historically has had higher margins than the rest of the other investigations and intelligence businesses 
gross margin at the information security group reflected a full year of operations and was in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was partially due to the acquisitions completed in and operating expenses of acquired companies represented million of total operating expenses in and million of total operating expenses in excluding operating expenses of these acquisitions  operating expenses increased million net of a million recovery of a previously written off bad debt 
included in this increase was a restructuring charge of million and million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets including goodwill 
in addition  approximately of the increase in expenses related to the additional legal  accounting  insurance and information systems costs required to administer the growth experienced by kroll o gara since the beginning of a key component of these costs was the implementation of new enterprise systems at one of the security products and services group s subsidiaries and at one of the investigation and intelligence group s subsidiaries as well as new corporate financial reporting software 
the remaining increase  million  related to overall compensation and benefits increases  an increase in the level of personnel and other administrative  marketing and facility costs 
in  kroll o gara recorded approximately million in expenses related to the mergers with laboratory specialists  schiff  securify and background america 
in  kroll o gara recorded approximately million in merger and integration related expenses associated with those acquisitions 
in addition  kroll o gara recorded approximately million in failed merger expenses associated with the failed recapitalization merger with blackstone 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the blackstone transaction 
as a percent of net sales  operating expenses  before merger related  restructuring and failed merger costs  were in and in as mentioned previously  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result of increased fixed costs to administer the growth experienced by kroll o gara since the beginning of interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in with the completion of the offering  a significant portion of kroll o gara s indebtedness was repaid approximately million 
as a result  kroll o gara experienced lower interest expense starting in the third quarter of and continuing through the first quarter of however  due to the significant number of acquisitions completed in the second half of and first half of  remaining cash from the offering was utilized 
kroll o gara began to draw on its million credit facility in  primarily to fund the million cash portion of the buchler phillips purchase price and to fund overall growth and working capital  particularly the additional cash needs of the information security group 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in net proceeds of the offering that were not used to repay debt were invested in short term instruments with maturities of three months or less

provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in in comparison with million in the effective tax rates for the periods were in and in in  kroll o gara recorded taxes at an effective rate significantly higher than it had previously experienced largely due to the non deductibility of some of the merger related expenses incurred in the period as well as increases in nondeductible goodwill and intangible amortization 
the tax provision also reflected the favorable impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain foreign jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards  net of other foreign losses that did not have a current benefit 
in  kroll o gara determined that certain of the kroll holdings merger expenses qualified for future deductibility which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in in addition  the tax provision also reflected the favorable impact of foreign locations with statutory tax rates at levels below us tax rates and the reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
certain foreign jurisdictions realized losses in from which kroll o gara was not able to benefit for tax purposes 
discontinued operations 
the loss from operations of the discontinued voice and data communications group increased million from million in to million in this increase was due to an increase in the group s inventory reserve which resulted from technology changes in the telecommunications market effectively reducing demand and lowering sales prices for certain items included in the group s inventory 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the future realizability of the tax benefit associated with the voice and data communication group s losses  management concluded that a valuation allowance for the entire tax benefit was required in both and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
kroll o gara had previously capitalized costs associated with the start up of activities  including pre operating costs  organization costs and other start up costs 
these capitalized costs were amortized over periods ranging from one to five years 
the capitalized amount  million before tax  was expensed in in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on the cost of start up activities 
the amount expensed is shown net of applicable tax benefit of million 
net income loss 
net income decreased million from million in to a loss of million in the decrease was due primarily to a million increase in operating expenses  partially offset by million in increased gross profit and a decreased provision for income taxes  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources general

credit facilities and senior notes 
on march   kroll o gara entered into an amended and restated loan agreement  which expires on may  if not terminated earlier as described below  to provide for a revolving credit facility that initially amounts to million 
the agreement also provides for a letter of credit facility of approximately million supporting the company s economic development revenue bonds and up to million of transactional letters of credit 
letters of credit cannot be issued or renewed with a maturity date beyond may  the agreement is secured by substantially all assets of kroll o gara and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of essentially all the subsidiaries  all of which jointly and severally guarantee obligations under the agreement 
the revolving credit facility includes required quarterly reductions of approximately million on each of june and september  and approximately million on each of december  and march  in the amount that may be borrowed under the facility and  if necessary  corresponding principal repayments to the adjusted levels 
in addition  the net proceeds from any lender approved sale of assets in excess of million per transaction or million per fiscal year must be paid proportionately to the revolving credit facility lender and to the holders of kroll o gara s outstanding million principal amount of senior notes discussed below  with a corresponding reduction in the total permitted borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
this includes the net proceeds from the sale to armor and any proceeds from additional sales of kroll o gara s stock ownership in securify or other assets in excess of the threshold amounts 
borrowings under kroll o gara s line of credit were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  and million at march  in connection with the amended credit facility  kroll o gara entered into amended and restated agreements with the holders of its senior notes 
these agreements also are secured by substantially all assets of kroll o gara and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of essentially all the subsidiaries and are jointly and severally guaranteed by essentially all the subsidiaries 
the amended and restated senior note agreements require total principal payments of  on each of june and september  and of  on each of december  and march  the balance is payable at maturity in may  but maturity will be accelerated to may  if kroll o gara s revolving credit agreement is not renewed and  as described below  further accelerated upon closing of the transaction with armor 
the amended bank loan and senior note agreements contain substantially identical financial covenants which  among other restrictions  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and other financial requirements  including an interest coverage ratio  net worth minimums and minimum quarterly ebitda that requires kroll o gara to effectively break even before taxes and to generate ebitda of million per quarter 
the agreements also impose limitations on mergers  acquisitions  stock redemptions  additional indebtedness and capital expenditures 
the loan agreement does not permit the declaration or payment of any dividend  other than stock dividends 
kroll o gara was not in compliance with certain of the covenants under the prior bank loan agreement as of december  had the lender not amended and restated the agreement  all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement would have been immediately payable 
the bank loan agreement and senior loan agreements were further amended as of april  in connection with kroll o gara s agreement to sell the security products and services group to armor 
the march  agreements required interest on advances under the revolving credit facility and on the senior notes at the greater of or the prime rate plus at march  
effective april  the interest rate under all of the agreements was changed to the greater of a or b prime plus  plus times the number of day periods which have expired since april  or  if less  the highest rate allowed by law 
kroll o gara s agreement with armor provides that it will receive million at closing  million of which is expected to be paid in armor stock 
of the million cash  million will be used for transaction costs and certain other payables 
the remaining cash must be paid immediately to the revolving credit facility lender and to the senior note holders 
during the days following closing of the transaction with armor  any proceeds from the sale of the armor stock also must be paid immediately to the revolving credit facility lender and senior note holders in the same percentages 
all remaining outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the senior notes are due days after closing 
kroll o gara has been in discussions with another lender to provide financing subsequent to the sale of the security products and services group to armor 
after payment of the net proceeds from the sale of the security products and services group to the revolving credit facility lender and the senior note holders  kroll o gara expects there to be approximately million remaining outstanding to these parties which must be repaid no later than days after closing 
kroll o gara believes that it can obtain a credit facility of approximately million at interest rates comparable to the rate under the march  amendment to its existing credit facilities 
therefore  the anticipated financing under discussion should be adequate to meet the ongoing needs of kroll o gara 
if the sale of the security products and services group to armor is not consummated  kroll o gara believes it can continue to remain in compliance with all the terms and conditions of the bank loan agreement and senior note agreements for the remainder of their terms 
however  based on the increasing interest rates included in the amended bank loan agreement and senior note agreements  kroll o gara would endeavor to obtain new financing if the sale to armor is not consummated

foreign operations 
kroll o gara attempts to mitigate the risks of doing business in foreign countries by separately incorporating its operations in those countries  maintaining reserves for credit losses  maintaining insurance on equipment to protect against losses related to political risks and terrorism  and using financial instruments to hedge kroll o gara s risk from translation gains and losses 
kroll o gara utilizes derivative financial instruments  in the form of forward contracts  to effectively hedge a specific portion of its exposure to certain foreign currency rate fluctuations on its net investment in two foreign subsidiaries 
at december  ten such contracts  maturing between january and december were outstanding 
the notional amount  together with amortized premium  and the fair market value associated with these forward contracts were million and million  respectively 
if statement of financial accounting standards no 
had been applied to all net investment hedge contracts in place at december   the effect would have been to decrease assets by approximately million with an offsetting amount recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of shareholders equity 
kroll o gara does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
quarterly fluctuations 
kroll o gara s operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of the timing of contract costs and revenues of its security products and services group  particularly from its military and governmental contracts which are generally awarded on a periodic and or sporadic basis 
kroll o gara generally does not have long term contracts with its clients in its investigations and intelligence group and its ability to generate net sales is dependant upon obtaining many new projects each year  most of which are of a relatively short duration 
period to period comparisons within a given year or between years may not be meaningful or indicative of operating results over a full fiscal year 
new accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas  as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  kroll o gara has several net investment hedge contracts in place 
these instruments have historically qualified for hedge accounting throughout the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
kroll o gara has adopted the provisions of sfas beginning on january  kroll o gara has designated these contracts as net investment hedges under sfas and  as such  the accounting under this new statement will approximate its previous accounting 
based on current hedge instruments and designations  kroll o gara will account for changes in the fair value of its net investment hedge contracts that is  based on the forward exchange rate with the related changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income loss 
kroll o gara does not expect that it will realize any material charges to earnings pursuant to sfas see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  in the event of a future change in facts or in the underlying net investment hedge relationships  kroll o gara could experience future volatility in earnings 
in march  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no

see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for costs incurred to acquire or originate information for database content and other collections of information  states that the eitf is considering different views for the accounting for database costs 
one of the views would require kroll o gara to expense some or all of the database costs that kroll o gara currently capitalizes and amortizes  which is currently an acceptable alternative 
adoption of a different method of accounting for database costs could have a material impact on kroll o gara s financial position and results of operations 
to date  the eitf has not made any official determinations on this issue
