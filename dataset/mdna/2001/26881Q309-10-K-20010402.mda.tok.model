item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since commencing operations in  we have been principally engaged in the research and development of our product candidates as well as seeking various regulatory clearances and patent protection 
we have had no revenues from product sales and have incurred cumulative losses since inception through december  aggregating approximately million 
we have received revenues in connection with the following licensing and collaboration agreements schering ag in june  we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement pursuant to which we granted schering ag an exclusive license to co develop and market ms worldwide  exclusive of japan 
in december  we amended this strategic collaboration agreement to grant to schering ag the exclusive rights to develop and market ms in japan 
generally  we will both share equally in ms clinical development costs and profits 
under the agreement  we will assume responsibility for completing clinical trials and filing for fda approval in the united states  and schering ag will lead clinical activities for ms outside of the united states 
in addition  we granted schering an exclusive option to develop and market an unspecified cardiovascular product from our pipeline 
in connection with this strategic collaboration agreement and in connection with the amendment to the strategic collaboration agreement between us and mallinckrodt  as further described below  schering ag paid us an up front fee of million  which we then paid to mallinckrodt 
schering ag also made a million equity investment in us at per share of common stock  through its affiliate  schering berlin venture corporation schering bv 
we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments under the strategic collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the december amendment  schering ag paid us an up front fee of million and may be required to pay us an additional million upon our achievement of certain milestones 
mallinckrodt in june  in connection with the exclusive license that we granted to schering ag  we amended our strategic collaboration with mallinckrodt to grant mallinckrodt a non exclusive  worldwide license to manufacture ms for clinical development and commercial use in accordance with a manufacturing agreement entered into in june between mallinckrodt and schering ag  and to enable us to enter into the strategic collaboration agreement with schering ag described above 
in connection with this amendment  we paid mallinckrodt an up front fee of million and may be required to pay up to an additional million in milestones 
we will also pay mallinckrodt a share of operating margins in the us and a royalty on gross profits outside the us on sales of ms as a result of the above noted agreements  schering ag effectively purchased the ms marketing rights previously owned by mallinckrodt 
the million payment from schering ag to us was required to be paid by us to mallinckrodt 
we paid the million to mallinckrodt immediately subsequent to its receipt and did not reflect the receipt and the disbursement in our statement of operations on the basis that the payment to us from schering ag did not constitute an earnings process nor did the payment by us to mallinckrodt represent an expense 
such amounts are  however  reflected in the statement of cash flows 
in october  we entered into a non negotiable promissory note and security agreement the loan with mallinckrodt  our strategic partner  under which we were eligible to borrow our share of ms development costs  on a quarterly basis  up to a total of million 
in june  pursuant to the amended collaboration agreement with mallinckrodt and the new strategic collaboration with schering  schering assumed the development cost sharing obligation for ms from mallinckrodt as of january  as a result  the terms of the loan were amended to allow funding under the loan for our portion of development costs through december  the loan balance at december  of  represents our share of third and fourth quarter ms development cost 
no additional funding is available to us under the loan 
the loan bears interest  adjustable on a quarterly basis  at the prime rate published in the wall street journal and is repayable in full on october  the loan is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the company s intellectual property 
daiichi in march  we entered into a development and license agreement with daiichi pursuant to which we granted daiichi an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ms in japan 
under this arrangement  daiichi assumed primary responsibility for clinical development  regulatory approval  marketing and distribution of ms in japan 
we retained the right and obligation to manufacture ms for development activities and commercial sale under the agreement 
in december  we reacquired the rights to develop and commercialize ms in from daiichi 
under the terms of this reacquisition agreement  we agreed to pay daiichi a total of million 
in january  we paid daiichi million in fees and we will pay an additional million in the future 
daiichi will also receive a royalty from us on net sales of ms in japan 
simultaneously with our reacquisition from daiichi of the ms development and marketing rights in japan  we assigned these rights to schering ag as described above 
we expect continued operating losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to support research  development and efforts to obtain regulatory approvals 
our initial product candidate  ms  is currently our only product candidate undergoing human clinical trials 
we filed an ind application for ms in july we initiated a phase i clinical trial in and a phase i dose escalation study in  both of which have been completed 
we completed a phase ii clinical trial in june to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of ms enhanced mra for the evaluation of pvd and are currently conducting a phase ii feasibility trial to test the safety and feasibility of ms enhanced mra for the evaluation of cad 
in addition  in march  we completed enrollment in a phase ii clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of ms for detecting breast cancer 
in june  we initiated a phase iii clinical trial to determine the efficacy of ms enhanced mra for the detection of aiod 
we anticipate fluctuation in our quarterly results of operations due to several factors  including the timing of fees and milestone payments received from strategic partners  the formation of new strategic alliances by us  the timing of expenditures in connection with research and development activities  the timing of product introductions and associated launch  marketing and sales activities  and the timing and extent of product acceptance for different indications and geographical areas of the world 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  in the fourth quarter of  we adopted sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements retroactively to january   changing our method of recognizing revenue 
we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in accordance with the adoption of sab in the amount of million  which related to up front and guaranteed milestone fees paid in and by mallinckrodt  our previous marketing partner for ms prior to the adoption of sab  we recognized revenues from non refundable license fees upon execution of the underlying license agreement 
revenues from milestone payments under collaborative agreements were recorded as revenue based upon the provisions of each agreement 
under the new accounting method  after the adoption of sab  we now recognize revenues from non refundable license fees  and milestone payments not specifically tied to a separate earnings process ratably over the period during which we have a substantial continuing obligation to perform services under the contract 
included in revenues is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab the remaining million of revenue to be recognized in future years that is included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle will be recognized ratably over the future period during which we have a substantial continuing obligation to perform services under the contract 
the pro forma amounts presented in the statements of operations were calculated assuming the accounting change was made retroactively to prior periods 
million is included  each year  in revenue for  and the following discussions relating to revenue for the year ended december  and revenue for the year ended december  reflect pro forma results as if we had followed sab from our inception 
revenues for the year ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
excluding million of sab revenues in both periods  revenues were derived from work performed in connection with product development contracts with schering ag in the year ended december  and mallinckrodt in the year ended december  the increase in revenues was due to the impact of the development funding terms under the strategic collaboration agreement entered into with schering ag in june research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the million increase resulted primarily from higher costs associated with advancing ms through clinical trials and the related effect of new development funding terms under the strategic collaboration agreement with schering ag  increased costs for personnel and other resources associated with advancing our thrombus imaging program and million of expenses incurred in december associated with the reacquisition of the japanese rights to develop and commercialize ms from daiichi 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs of material produced in connection with our strategic alliance with daiichi 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the  increase was due to increased costs related to corporate communications and marketing activities 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower legal costs related to ongoing patent activities 
interest income and interest expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the  increase was primarily due to slightly higher average levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in the increase in interest expense was attributable to a higher average balance in our loan payable to mallinckrodt in the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  the following discussions relating to revenue for the year ended december  and revenue for the year ended december  reflect pro forma results as if we had followed sab from our inception 
revenues revenues for the year ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
excluding million of revenues in both periods relating to sab  revenues were derived from work performed in connection with product development contracts 
the decrease in revenues was due to the timing of cost sharing reimbursements and from development costs incurred by our partners and us 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increased expenses resulted from higher manufacturing costs of material to be provided to our japanese partner  daiichi  and increased personnel and related costs associated with advancing ms through clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the slight increase was due to higher legal costs associated with ongoing patent activities and was partially offset by lower compensation expense and recruiting costs 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the  decrease was primarily due to lower average levels of invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in the increase in interest expense was attributable to a higher average note payable balance outstanding during liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  in june  we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement pursuant to which we granted schering ag an exclusive license to co develop and market ms worldwide  exclusive of japan

in connection with this strategic collaboration agreement and in connection with the amendment to the strategic collaboration agreement between us and mallinckrodt  as further described below  schering ag paid us an up front fee of million  which we then paid to mallinckrodt 
schering ag also made a million dollar equity investment in us at per share of common stock  through its affiliate  schering berlin venture corporation schering bv 
in return for their investment  we issued  shares of our common stock to schering bv 
we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments under the strategic collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the december amendment  schering ag paid us an up front fee of million and may be required to pay us an additional million upon our achievement of certain milestones 
in june  in connection with the exclusive license that we granted to schering ag  we amended our strategic collaboration with mallinckrodt to grant mallinckrodt a non exclusive  worldwide license to manufacture ms for clinical development and commercial use in accordance with a manufacturing agreement entered into in june between mallinckrodt and schering ag  and to enable us to enter into the strategic collaboration agreement with schering ag described above

no additional funding is available to us under the loan 
the loan bears interest  adjustable on a quarterly basis  at the prime rate published in the wall street journal and is repayable in full on october  the loan is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the company s intellectual property 
in march  we entered into a development and license agreement with daiichi pursuant to which we granted daiichi an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ms in japan 
under this arrangement  daiichi assumed primary responsibility for clinical development  regulatory approval  marketing and distribution of ms in japan 
we retained the right and obligation to manufacture ms for development activities and commercial sale under the agreement

under the terms of this reacquisition agreement  we agreed to pay daiichi a total of million 
in january  we paid daiichi million in fees and we will pay an additional million in the future 
daiichi will also receive a royalty from us on net sales of ms in japan 
simultaneously with our reacquisition from daiichi of the ms development and marketing rights in japan  we assigned these rights to schering ag as described above 
during the year ended december   we used approximately million of cash for operating activities 
we expect that our cash needs for operations will increase significantly in future periods due to planned clinical trials and other expenses associated with the development of ms and new research and development programs 
in september  we entered into an agreement with acqua wellington north american equities fund ltd 
acqua wellington for an equity financing facility covering the sale of up to million of our common stock over a month period 
these shares may be sold at our discretion at a small discount to the market price of our shares at the time of the sale 
the total amount of the investment is dependent  in part  on our stock price  with us controlling the amount and timing of the stock sold 
during  we received  and in  we received an additional  in net proceeds from acqua wellington under this facility 
we estimate that existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as well as our equity financing facility with acqua wellington  will be sufficient to fund our operations through the first quarter of we believe that we will need to raise additional funds for research  development and other expenses through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances or otherwise  in order to achieve commercial introduction of any of our product candidates 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and scope of clinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both united states and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of our ongoing research and development programs  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of our products  and  if necessary  once regulatory approvals are received  the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
because of anticipated spending to support development of ms and new research programs  we do not expect positive cash flow from operating activities for any future quarterly or annual period prior to commercialization of ms we anticipate continued investments in fixed assets  including equipment and facilities expansion to support new and continuing research and development programs 
we have in place a lease agreement that will enable us to utilize our current principal scientific facilities through december   and we have an option to extend the lease for an additional three or five years 
we also have a lease for nearby office space  which expires in december we have incurred tax losses to date and therefore have not paid significant federal or state income taxes since inception 
at december   we had loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these amounts expire at various times through as a result of ownership changes resulting from sales of equity securities  our ability to use the loss carryforwards is subject to limitations as defined in sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
we currently estimate that the annual limitation on our use of net operating losses through may  will be approximately  pursuant to sections and of the code  the change in ownership resulting from public equity offerings in and any other future ownership changes may further limit utilization of losses and credits in any one year 
we also are eligible for research and development tax credits that can be carried forward to offset federal taxable income 
the annual limitation and the timing of attaining profitability may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operations 
the discussion included in this section as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements based on our current expectations 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected 
see factors regarding forward looking statements attached hereto as exhibit and incorporated by reference into this form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements which speak only as the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended by sfas  requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the effective date of this statement was deferred to fiscal years beginning after june  by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of subsequent events the company received  in net proceeds during  pursuant to its funding arrangement with acqua wellington 
sfas no 
we believe the adoption of this new accounting standard will not have a significant effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national governmental entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the weighted average interest rate and weighted average remaining maturity of marketable securities at december  was and approximately months  respectively 
the fair market value of securities held at december  was  the interest rate on our note payable to mallinkrodt is adjustable on a quarterly basis and therefore subjects the company to interest rate risk 
however  based on the outstanding loan balance of  at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a significant increase in the company s annual interest expense 
the interest rates on our capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk
