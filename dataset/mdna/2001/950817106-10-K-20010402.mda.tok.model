item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion per share  up from billion per share at december  an exceptionally large increase in retained earnings  resulting mainly from realization of securities gains  was approximately offset by a major reduction in unrealized appreciation of investments  a separate component of shareholders equity 
as a result  unrealized appreciation declined from to of shareholders equity 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded using current  typically fluctuating market quotations  the gains or losses ultimately realized upon sale of investments could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation

insurance segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the insurance segment ie  wes fic and kbs  which represent essentially the combination of underwriting results with dividend and interest income in thousands year ended december  premiums written    premiums earned    underwriting gain    dividend and interest income    income before income taxes    income tax provision    segment net income    premiums written for  and were comprised of million  million and million attributable to kbs  and million  million and million attributable to wes fic 
premiums written by wes fic for were attributable principally to its participation in the first of a three year arrangement for the reinsurance of of certain property and casualty risk exposure of a large  unaffiliated insurance group 
wes fic s earned premiums for and related mainly to its participation in quota share super catastrophe reinsurance arrangements  notably a three year florida hurricane risk policy that ended  without loss  at yearend 
the decrease in premiums written by kbs for was due mainly to the restructuring of kbs s reinsurance program effective january   as explained in item  business  in this connection  kbs received and credited to premiums written in million of unearned reinsurance premiums that had been deducted from premiums written in prior years 
earned premiums for  and included million  million and million attributable to kbs 
the remainder in each year was attributable to wes fic and related principally to the reinsurance participations described above 
the underwriting gain for  and included million  million and million attributable to kbs  and 
million  million and million to wes fic 
aggregate underwriting gain benefited by  million million and million in  and from downward revisions of estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
underwriting results at kbs have become more volatile since it restructured its reinsurance program at the beginning of wes fic participates in super catastrophe reinsurance from time to time  and  while no such business became available for  other participations may become available in the future 
although no super catastrophe reinsurance losses have been incurred to date  wesco s management believes that large super catastrophe reinsurance losses will inevitably occur from time to time during periods when wes fic participates actively in such business 
while such large losses are not expected to be significant in relation to wes fic s capital base  management accepts the prospect of increased volatility in wes fic s short term underwriting results in order to obtain what is believed will be better long term results 
one area of particular concern to the insurance industry is its exposure to claims for environmental contamination 
wesco s management believes such exposure to be minimal 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance group principally on capital contributed by wesco  on earnings retained and reinvested  and on float funds invested pending payment of claims 
the income tax provision of the insurance segment has fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income in each of the periods presented in the foregoing table 
these fluctuations have been caused by fluctuations in the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and the related liabilities reflected on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  because they are estimates  are subject to estimation error 
revisions of such estimates in future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for those periods 
however  wesco s insurance subsidiaries have maintained capital positions strong enough not only to absorb adverse estimation corrections but also to enable them to accept other insurance contracts 
as explained in item  business  wes fic has reinsured various property and casualty risks  in varying amounts  of large  unaffiliated insurance companies 
although wesco would welcome other attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  or acquisitions of insurance businesses like or unlike that of kbs  the timing and extent of any increase in its insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted

furniture rental segment following is a summary of the operating results of cort as included in wesco s year consolidated results of operations since acquisition in late february of for comparative purposes  corresponding amounts for all of and are also presented  these unaudited figures are set forth exclusive of items not classified as segment related by wesco goodwill amortization  securities gains or losses  and income tax provisions or benefits related thereto 
amounts are in thousands 
late february to year ended december  december  revenues furniture rentals    furniture sales    cost of rentals and sales    selling  general and administrative expenses    interest expense    income before income taxes    income tax provision    segment net income    cort s revenues for the year increased million  or  over those reported for  due principally to increased rental revenues 
rental revenues before the impact of acquisitions  trade show operations and a significant  short term contract with the us bureau of the census  increased approximately 
cort s management attributes this increase in core rental revenues to the combination of growth in the number of furniture leases outstanding and an increase in average revenue per lease 
cort has noted  however  that the rate of growth of new orders declined sharply in the fourth quarter of  reflecting changing economic conditions 
furniture sales revenues increased approximately in as a result of cort s ongoing efforts to maintain the quality of its rental furniture 
cost of furniture rentals and sales amounted to of related revenues for the year versus for the increase in the cost percentage for reflected various factors  most significantly the following an increase in distribution costs relating to the handling of rental furniture  and an increase in depreciation expense  recorded on a declining balance method  reflecting an increase in the proportion of newer furniture being leased as revenues have grown 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly in relation to rental and sales revenues  to for the year from for this was due mainly to normal increases in employee compensation and benefits 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for pro forma consolidated operating data calculated as if wesco had acquired cort on january   and note to such statements for information on furniture rental segment accounting policies 
industrial segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries in thousands year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services    income before income taxes    income tax provision   segment net income    revenues of precision steel s businesses for increased 
despite a decrease in pounds of steel products sold 
revenues for decreased despite a increase in pounds of steel products sold 
precision steel s management attributed these anomalies to a combination of factors 
in  increases in selling prices in response to increases in costs of its raw materials were almost completely offset by the effects of a softening demand for precision steel s products caused by increasing concerns over general economic conditions within the manufacturing segment of the economy 
in  a shift in mix of products sold toward lower priced products and a decline in selling prices of higher margin items following price decreases by mills and other suppliers were principally responsible 
income before income taxes and normal net operating income of the industrial segment are dependent not only on revenues  but also on operating expenses and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at all levels 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
precision steel s costs for and also included 
million and 
million  respectively  before income taxes 
million and 
million after taxes  for the upgrading of computer systems to ensure that its order taking and other information technology systems would continue to function properly beyond december  unrelated to business segment operations set forth below is a summary of items increasing decreasing wesco s consolidated net income that are viewed by management as unrelated to the operations of the insurance  furniture rental and industrial segments in thousands year ended december  goodwill amortization  before income tax effect  income tax benefit goodwill amortization  realized net securities gains  before income tax effect    income tax provision    realized net securities gains    other nonsegment items rental income from commercial real estate    dividend and interest income   net gains on sales of foreclosed real estate  reduction in allowance for losses on foreclosed real estate  real estate and general and administrative expenses    interest expense   other items  net income loss before income tax benefit income tax provision benefit net income from other nonsegment activities goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of identified net assets of acquired businesses 
in the case of the wesco group  it relates to the acquisition of cort in and kbs in and is being amortized mainly over years 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
realized gains and losses on the wesco group s investments have fluctuated in amount from year to year  sometimes impacting net income significantly  as in however  the amounts and timing of these realizations have no predictive or practical analytical value 
wesco s investments are carried at market value  and unrealized gains or losses are reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity 
when gains or losses are realized  due to sale of securities or other triggering event  they are credited or charged  net of tax effect  to the consolidated statement of income  generally  in wesco s case  there has been little effect on total shareholders equity merely a transfer from unrealized appreciation to retained earnings 
wesco s consolidated earnings for contained net realized securities gains  after income taxes  of million  compared to million of after tax gains for and million for as can be seen by referring to the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity  these realizations were the principal reason for the reduction in the unrealized appreciation component of shareholders equity  over the same three year period  from billion to million 
see the section on market risk analysis appearing below in this item  as well as note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on investments 
other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate  dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  and gains on sales of foreclosed real estate previously owned by a former savings and loan subsidiary together with reductions of reserves for possible losses on such sales  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses and interest and other corporate expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such items 
net income or loss from other nonsegment activities typically fluctuates from period to period but is not significant in amount 
the figures benefited to the extent of 
million  after tax effect  from a reduction in reserves for possible losses on disposition of foreclosed real estate  there were no adjustments of these reserves in or ms property generally has succeeded in selling foreclosed properties at prices much higher than were anticipated when the real estate market was extremely depressed earlier in the s 
nonsegment dividend and interest income has declined sharply in recent years mainly due to conversions of preferred stocks into lower yielding common stocks in and and to the contributions of certain of those investments to the insurance segment 
the net tax provision or benefit from other nonsegment activities each year appears at first glance to be anomalous compared to pre tax income or loss 
this is caused by the inclusion in pre tax income or loss of declining amounts of dividend income  which is taxed at lower rates than other revenue and expense items 
wesco s effective consolidated income tax rate typically fluctuates from period to period for various reasons  such as the inclusion in consolidated revenues of significant  varying amounts of dividend income  which is substantially exempt from income taxes 
the respective income tax provisions  expressed as percentages of income before income taxes  amounted to  and in  and see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
management s long term goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share  with little regard to earnings recorded in any given year 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments or the realization of securities gains 
securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire for funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains and losses and the possible occurrence of other unusual nonoperating items such as the acquisition of cort in february see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income from operations are expected to be much more volatile than they were prior to wes fic s entry into the super catastrophe reinsurance business several years ago and  to a lesser degree  the restructuring of kbs s reinsurance program at the beginning of shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent that unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are often established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive  operate on tight gross profit margins  and carry inventories on a lifo basis  thus their earnings are susceptible to bad effects from inflationary cost increases 
market risk analysis wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
its marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and its securities with fixed maturities  if not held to maturity  are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
on the other hand  wesco s consolidated deferred income tax liability relates primarily to appreciation in fair values of investments and would decline proportionately if there were a drop in market valuation 
otherwise  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as those relating to changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates 
the wesco group does not utilize stand alone derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of marketable equity securities stated at market value  down from billion one year earlier 
the principal reason for the decline was the sale of what had been the consolidated group s largest holding  common stock of freddie mac billion at december  
the carrying values of the remaining securities are not only directly exposed to fluctuations in their stock market prices see table below  they are also indirectly exposed to risks related to other markets 
for example  the two largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  million  combined were in common stocks of the coca cola company and the gillette company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks such as commodity price fluctuations  where material  are required to be reported upon in their filings with the securities and exchange commission  which are available to the public 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not necessarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amounts realized upon the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table shows the effects as of december  of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity amounts in thousands increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded   hypothetical   shareholders equity as recorded   hypothetical   the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the table do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 
interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  up from million one year earlier 
most of the increase was in mortgage backed securities million at december  versus million one year earlier 
as noted in the preceding section on equity price risk  wesco prefers to acquire entire businesses or invest in equity securities 
when unable to do so  it may invest in bonds or other interest rate sensitive investments 
wesco s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risk 
wesco recognizes and accepts that losses may occur 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
additionally  fair values of these investments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the following table shows the estimated effects as of december  of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on the fair value of wesco s fixed maturity investments and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity dollar amounts in thousands fair value of shareholders investments equity as recorded   hypothetical change in interest rate percentage point decrease   percentage point increase   percentage point increase   percentage point increase   the hypothetical changes in market interest rates assumed in preparing the table do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
for example  variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments of mortgage backed securities due to prepayment options available to borrowers under the mortgages 
for this and other reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table
