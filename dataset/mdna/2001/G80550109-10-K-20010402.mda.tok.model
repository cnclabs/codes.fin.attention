item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  overview our principal asset is a interest  before participation by ecopetrol  in the dindal and rio seco association contracts  which cover the area in which the guaduas oil field is located 
as of december   ryder scott company petroleum consultants estimated total proved recoverable reserves for the guaduas oil field of million barrels of oil  of which million barrels of oil were attributable to our interest 
our current plans for the year are set forth under business our current strategy 
whether we can achieve our objectives on schedule depends on a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
factors include securing financing to fund our share of costs for our development and exploration strategy  timely environmental permitting  timely payments by the association contract partners of their share of these costs and the market price of oil field equipment and services 
we will seek additional sources of financing through project financing  industry joint ventures or arrangements with industry service companies  commercial bank borrowings and traditional debt and equity financing 
in our form k and subsequent u 
s securities and exchange commission filings  we outlined three scenarios for moving forward with the development of the guaduas oil field 
scenario assumed ecopetrol participated in the development of the guaduas oil field 
scenario assumed ecopetrol did not participate in the development of the field  but authorized seven seas and our partners to proceed with development on a sole risk basis 
sole risk means that seven seas and our partners pay of development costs and retain all revenues from production after the colombian royalty deduction 
ecopetrol has the right to start participating in development at any time subject to seven seas and partners right to recover of the development costs spent since ecopetrol s decision not to participate plus certain exploration costs 
scenario also assumed that together with our partners we would proceed to develop the field as proposed to ecopetrol ie construct a pipeline and drill development wells for production of  bopd to  bopd 
like scenario  scenario assumed that ecopetrol would elect not to participate  but assumed that we would modify our development program as proposed to ecopetrol by postponing the construction of the pipeline and development drilling 
after ecopetrol elected not to participate in the development on may   together with our partners  we elected to proceed sole risk under scenario in previous filings  including last year s form k  we stated that if we proceeded under scenario  we expected to commence pipeline production approximately one year after ecopetrol made its election 
as of the filing date of this report  we are on schedule to complete the pipeline by mid year the following narrative summarizes the principal activities of in review during the first quarter of  we fulfilled our obligations under a september  memorandum of understanding agreement with ecopetrol that eventually led to ecopetrol s decision on whether to participate in the development of the guaduas oil field 
specifically  we completed the long term production test of the guaduas oil field  producing close to  barrels of oil  conducted a pressure build up test and completed and tested the el segundo e well 
we continued our cost reduction program and reorganization of our bogota office  reducing the number of positions by approximately at an annualized savings of approximately million 
this cost reduction program  which commenced in  contributed to a million decrease in our general and administrative costs between and  and a decrease of over million between and our general and administrative costs included over million in non reoccurring expenses associated with severance costs and our continuance to the cayman islands 
also during the first quarter of  we hired j 
anthony stuart  a year employee of british petroleum  as our drilling manager in our bogota office 
mr 
stuart had spent the previous nine years working for bp in colombia on the development of the cusiana cupiagua field  colombia s largest known oil field 
at the time of his retirement from bp  mr 
stuart was serving as drilling operations manager 
in early  we made mr 
stuart vice president of operations of ghk company colombia  our subsidiary in colombia and the operator of the guaduas oil field 
mr 
stuart will oversee the drilling of the subthrust exploration well provided it is drilled this year 
concurrent with mr 
stuart s promotion  we also named claudia m 
vaca vice president of legal  finance and administration of ghk company colombia 
prior to this position  ms 
vaca  who is a graduate of the harvard law school  was serving as ghk company colombia s general counsel 
in july and august of  after ecopetrol decided not to participate in the development of the guaduas oil field and we decided to proceed sole risk  the colombian ministry of environment and ministry of mines and energy granted all the permits and licenses required to develop and produce the guaduas oil field 
after we received the requisite colombian governmental approvals and licenses  we commenced post exploration phase production of the guaduas oil field on august  with the exception of pre scheduled field shut in periods or road closures  we produced and trucked between  bopd and  bopd for the remainder of the year  resulting in gross total production of over  barrels of oil   of which were net to our interest 
in october  we commenced operations for the construction of the pipeline  ordering long lead items such as pipe and pumps  and we began to purchase rights of way 
during the fourth quarter of  we re drilled  completed and tested the el segundo e well 
during a fifteen day production test  the el segundo e produced at an average rate of bopd  establishing production seven kilometers south of the southern most productive well in the guaduas oil field 
in november  r 
randolph devening was appointed to our board of directors 
mr 
devening currently serves as chief executive officer of foodbrands america  inc  a leading us producer  marketer and distributor of frozen and refrigerated products 
mr 
devening joined foodbrands america as chairman  president and ceo in when it was a public company listed on the new york stock exchange and prior to it becoming a subsidiary of ibp  inc 
before joining foodbrands america  mr 
devening held various senior level positions  including vice chairman of the board of fleming companies  inc mr 
devening is a graduate of stanford university and holds a masters in business administration in finance and marketing from harvard business school 
he currently serves as director of hancock fabrics  inc  keystone automotive operations  inc  and love s country stores  inc 
in december  we secured a million loan from stillwater national bank to be used primarily for the construction of the mile guaduas la dorada pipeline 
throughout the second half of the year  we were in negotiations with our guaduas oil field partners regarding their participation in the pipeline and the subthrust dindal prospect 
these negotiations were completed in late january key aspects of the global partner agreement that we signed in january are as follows o sipetrol and cimarrona elected to participate in the construction of the guaduas la dorada pipeline 
o sipetrol and cimarrona agreed to provide seven seas with the opportunity to earn certain of their interests in the subthrust dindal prospect by drilling a subthrust exploration well and paying sipetrol and cimarrona s share of the costs of drilling and testing the well 
additional information on our global partner agreement is available in a form k filed with the us securities and exchange commission on january  in late  we reached an agreement with ecopetrol to drill an exploration well on the rosablanca association contract area and relinquish the montecristo association contract to satisfy various second and third year obligations under these contracts 
one of the matters that culminated in early  but which we worked on in  was securing the deep dindal and cristales association contracts 
the deep dindal association contract  which is generically referred to as an on top contract because it originated from the dindal association contract  covers the subthrust dindal prospect located below the guaduas oil field 
the deep dindal contract provides better economic terms than the original dindal association contract 
the cristales association contract covers approximately  acres immediately to the east of the guaduas oil field and the subthrust dindal prospect 
another matter that culminated in early  but which we worked on in  was continuing the company to the cayman islands from the yukon territory  canada 
the principal reason for the change of domicile was to lower our future worldwide effective corporate tax rate 
other considerations were that most of our shareholders are not canadian and all of our oil and gas revenues are from non canadian operations 
on february  we received shareholder approval for the continuation  and effective march  we continued as a cayman island company 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced a search for a chief financial officer 
in march  we announced that ronald a 
lefaive was joining our company as vice president of finance and chief financial officer 
mr 
lefaive has years of finance and accounting experience in the domestic and international oil and gas industry  including positions with halliburton company  chesapeake energy corporation  phibro energy inc and shell oil company 
additionally  he has an extensive background in information technology 
mr 
lefaive is a certified public accountant and holds a bachelor s of business administration degree in accounting from the university of houston 
in summary  in  we took several important steps toward developing the guaduas oil field and securing a sustained source of cash flow 
we also positioned ourselves to test the upside potential of the subthrust dindal prospect in the near future under favorable terms with our partners and ecopetrol 
our current strategy our strategy for and includes the continued development of the guaduas oil field and new exploration 
a summary of our strategy follows development pipeline and production facilities we expect to complete the mile la dorada guaduas pipeline that will connect the guaduas oil field to international oil markets via colombia s existing pipeline infrastructure by mid the pipeline will have an initial capacity of approximately  bopd  but can be increased to  bopd with additional investment 
since we broke ground in january  we have made the following progress o completed the purchase of rights of way for the pipeline route o taken delivery of the inch pipe for the pipeline o nearly completed the clearing of the pipeline route o successfully completed underground river crossing  the most difficult part of the construction o secured access to existing pipelines that will transport guaduas oil field production from la dorada  the end point of the pipeline we are constructing  to the caribbean port of covenas we completed construction of a production facility for the production of  bopd to  bopd in january we now have four  barrel storage tanks on location  and we expect to complete the production facility for pipeline production by mid the gross costs of constructing the pipeline and production facilities are approximately million  our share of which is approximately million 
development wells we recently agreed with our guaduas oil field partners to a two year development well drilling schedule that provides for the drilling of nine development wells and one injector well for field pressure maintenance over the course of and we believe these wells will increase pipeline production of the guaduas oil field from its initial rate of  bopd  bopd to approximately  bopd  however  actual production will depend on the results of the development wells 
the gross costs of this development well drilling program is estimated to be million  our share of which is approximately million 
in  four development wells and one injector well are scheduled at a gross cost of million  our share of which is approximately million 
implementing this development drilling program will depend on our ability to finance our share of the costs 
in summary  our development strategy includes completing the guaduas la dorada pipeline and production facilities for pipeline production and drilling nine development wells and one injector well at a gross cost of million  our share of which is approximately million 
in  we expect to complete the pipeline and production facilities and drill four of the nine developments wells and the one injector well 
the gross cost of development operations  including the pipeline and production facilities is expected to be approximately million  our share of which is approximately million 
exploration subthrust dindal prospect in  we plan to drill an exploration well to test the high potential subthrust dindal prospect  located below the guaduas oil field 
as of february  this prospect is covered by the deep dindal association contract that originated from the dindal association contract 
this new contract provides more favorable fiscal terms than the original dindal association contract 
under the deep dindal association contract  our working interest after ecopetrol elects to participate in the development of an oil and gas discovery starts at  as compared to under the dindal contract 
additionally  as oil production increases  our working interest will gradually decrease to a minimum of  as compared to under the dindal contract 
in january  we signed a global agreement with our guaduas oil field partners that included a farm out of certain of their interests in the deep dindal association contract 
as a result of an exploration agreement with our guaduas oil field partners  we now have a interest in the deep dindal association contract  subject to an obligation to assign between approximately and to our partners after the first well has been drilled and tested 
in last year s form k  we estimated the gross costs of drilling and completing this well would be approximately million 
this estimate was based on the assumption that we would have to drill the well outside of an area that the municipality of guaduas had declared a forest reserve prohibiting oil and gas operations 
the municipality has subsequently revoked that forest reserve and adopted a previously created national forest reserve as the only existing reserve 
the existing forest reserve does not prohibit oil and gas activities  and in fact  the escuela  the first well drilled on the dindal association contract by our subsidiary ghk company colombia  was drilled from a surface location within the existing forest reserve 
although we must still receive a new environmental permit from the colombian ministry of environment  we plan to re use the escuela location for the subthrust exploration well 
as a result  we now estimate the cost of drilling and completing this well to be million 
because we have a working interest in the deep dindal association contract  we will be responsible for the entire cost of drilling and testing the well 
our ability to commence drilling of this well in is subject to securing financing for the costs of the well  timely receiving the required environmental permit  and contracting a drilling rig 
we plan to commence drilling this well as soon as possible after these three conditions have been satisfied  which we expect will be in late summer rosablanca exploration well we plan to drill an exploration well on the rosablanca association contract located in colombia s magdalena valley  approximately miles north of the guaduas oil field 
this well was scheduled to commence before february  to satisfy certain obligations under the rosablanca contract 
however  we have not received the required environmental permit from the colombian ministry of environment 
ecopetrol recently granted a month extension on our obligation as a result of this delay 
this well  to be called the santa fe well  will be drilled to an estimated total depth of feet at an estimated gross cost of million  of which we are responsible for 
tres pasos exploration well during the third quarter of  we plan to commence drilling of the tres pasos exploration well to test the west side of the guaduas oil field structure 
this well will satisfy the sixth year exploration obligation under the rio seco association contract 
we estimate the gross cost of this well will be million  or million net to seven seas 
in summary  our planned exploration strategy in provides for the drilling of three exploration wells at a gross cost of approximately million  our share of which is approximately million 
coupled with our development strategy  the gross total of planned capital expenditures in is approximately million  our share of which is approximately million 
our ability to fully implement our exploration and development strategy is subject to securing financing for our share of costs  timely receiving required environmental permits  contracting the required oil and gas services and equipment  and completing the guaduas la dorada pipeline and commencing pipeline production 
for additional information on our financing plans  see the next section financing our current strategy 
financing our current strategy in december  we entered into a million loan agreement with stillwater national bank and trust company  na on march   the loan s maturity date was extended from december  to april  the stillwater national bank loan is secured by all of the stock of the operating subsidiaries of seven seas and is guaranteed by robert a 
hefner iii  chairman and chief executive officer of seven seas 
mr 
hefner received remuneration of  for his guarantee 
the loan carries a coupon of the prime rate plus  and interest is payable monthly until the loan is due in full on april  seven seas intends to use these funds for working capital and plans to replace  without penalty  this non convertible loan with the proceeds from a larger financing planned for proceeds from the financing could also be used to finance the million interest payment that will be due on november  on our million senior notes 
furthermore  we believe that once the pipeline is built and is actually producing at the rate of between  bopd and  bopd  additional funds could be borrowed from the same or other lender s to finance a portion of the development costs necessary to bring production up to  bopd 
at this time  we do not know what percent or how much of our revenue will have to be dedicated to service the pipeline debt 
however  we intend to arrange this financing in such a way that loan proceeds and cash flow reserves will be sufficient to meet our million interest payment due on november  for our million senior notes 
non discretionary capital commitments for the year are the costs of constructing the pipeline for an initial production rate of between  bopd and  bopd  drilling an exploratory well on the rio seco block  drilling an exploratory well on the rosablanca block and the november  interest obligation for the million senior notes 
in the event we are unable to assign our interest in the tapir association contract  we may be responsible for our proportionate share of all or a portion of the costs of the work program

under this plan  we will drill an additional development wells in at a gross cost of approximately million  or net to seven seas 
in the event we are unable to assign our interest in the tapir association contract  we may be obligated to participate in all or a portion of the work program 
possible sources of financing include o commercial bank borrowing  o industry joint ventures or similar arrangement with industry service and supplies companies  o forward sales of oil  and o debt and equity financing

as of december   the maximum permitted amount of secured borrowing was approximately million 
we are also authorized under the terms of the senior notes to borrow an additional million for project financing  such as to pay the purchase price or construction costs of the pipeline and production facilities 
we have plans to seek approximately million in new financing  however  there are no assurances that we will be successful

we plan to use our available cash as set forth under business our current strategy 
see also financing our current strategy equity and financing activities as of december   we had  common shares  par value of  outstanding  of which none are restricted 
at december   we had outstanding million of senior notes due may  in accordance with the terms of the senior notes  we were required to hold in a separate account or in escrow monies to provide for the first three years of interest payable under the senior notes 
we purchased million in us government securities from the proceeds of the senior notes and deposited the securities in a segregated account 
the amount deposited into the segregated account was enough to pay the first two interest payments 
we also purchased and pledged million of us government securities to ensure payment of the four scheduled interest payments on the notes from november  through may  as of december   after making five interest payments  we had million in us government securities remaining  which is sufficient to pay interest on the senior notes through may our activities from inception through december  were funded primarily by the proceeds from private placements of our securities  including our common shares  warrants and notes  resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of million 
recent transactions include o exchangeable notes

the senior notes are senior obligations of seven seas and are ranked equally in right and priority of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to pay principal and interest on our debt when due  we would have to attempt to restructure or refinance the debt or sell assets to obtain funds 
capital spending from inception through december   we had cash expenditures for the exploration of oil and gas properties of million 
accounting policies and development stage accounting the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this document have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
our exploration and development activities have not generated a substantial amount of revenue  thus requiring the financial statements to be presented as a development stage enterprise 
accumulated losses are presented on the balance sheet as deficit accumulated during the development stage 
the income statement presents revenues and expenses for each period presented and also a cumulative total of both amounts from our inception 
period to period comparisons of such results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
in this regard  future results of seven seas will be highly dependent upon the success of our guaduas oil field operations 
the statement of cash flows shows inflows and outflows for each period presented and from our inception 
in addition  the notes to consolidated financial statements are required to identify the enterprise as development stage 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized in separate cost centers for each country 
such capitalized costs include contract and concession acquisition  geological  geophysical and other exploration work  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  constructing production facilities and pipelines  and other related costs 
we capitalized general and administrative costs of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we capitalized interest of million  million and million in  and respectively 
the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in each cost center are amortized on the composite units of production method based on future gross revenues from proved reserves 
sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are normally accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs 
gain or loss is not recognized in income unless a significant portion of a cost center s reserves are involved 
capitalized costs associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until it is determined whether proved reserves can be assigned to such properties or until the value of the properties is impaired 
if the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in a cost center exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves in the cost center and the lower of cost or fair value of properties not being amortized  both adjusted for income tax effects  such excess is charged to expense 
results of development stage operations years ended december   and revenues from oil sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
lease operating expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million and million increase during in oil and gas revenues and lease operating expenses  respectively  was due to the commencement of post exploration phase production in august oil production in colombia net to us  including minority interest through june  of  barrels   barrels and  barrels in  and  respectively  pertaining solely to our share of oil produced  was sold to refinerie del nare and ecopetrol at an average price of per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was the consequence of lower cash and investment balances resulting from the use of funds from the issuance of the senior notes in may general and administrative costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
non reoccurring general and administrative costs in amounted to and were related to the migration of the company to the cayman islands from the yukon territory and severance paid to certain employees as part of the company s reorganization of its bogota office 
the costs incurred during included million relating to costs incurred conducting feasibility studies for the proposed construction of pipeline and production facilities and other development activities in colombia 
depletion  depreciation and amortization was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we began recording depletion of our proved oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter  resulting in increased amounts in and as required under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized costs are limited to the sum of the present value of future net revenues  using current unescalated pricing and discounted at per annum from proved reserves and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unevaluated properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
there was no write down in or at december   we recognized a non cash write down of oil and gas properties in the amount of million pre tax or million after tax pursuant to this ceiling limitation 
the write down was primarily the result of the decline in crude oil prices and the impairment of unevaluated properties due primarily to the failure of five non commercial exploratory wells 
seven seas incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss includes a non cash write down of million pre tax 
the write down of oil and gas properties reduced the temporary differences included in deferred tax liabilities resulting in an income tax benefit of million and a write down after taxes of million 
taxes our net income  as defined under colombian law  from colombian sources is subject to colombian corporate income tax at a rate of 
an additional remittance tax is imposed upon remittance of profits abroad at a rate of 
during  we were also subject to income taxes in canada and the united states  where the statutory rates were and respectively 
the company had united states income tax expense of million in and million in forward looking information from time to time  seven seas may make certain statements that provide shareholders and the investing public with forward looking information as defined by the federal securities laws 
words such as anticipate  assume  believe  estimate  project  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing  including  but not limited to  in press releases  as part of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and as part of other sections of seven seas filings with the us securities and exchange commission 
such forward looking statements may include  but not be limited to  statements concerning estimates of current and future results of operations  financial position  reserves  the timing and commencement of wells and development plans  drilling results as indicated by log analysis  core samples  examination of cuttings  hydrocarbons shows while drilling and production estimates from wells drilled based upon drill stem tests and other test data  future capacity under credit arrangements  future capital expenditures  liquidity requirements and liquidity sufficiency 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including without limitation  those defined below 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should any of the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results of current and future operations may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
among the factors that have a direct bearing on seven seas results of operations and the oil and gas industry in which it operates are uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and future hydrocarbon production and cash flows  particularly with respect to wells that have not been fully tested and with wells having limited production testing histories  access to additional capital  changes in the price of oil and natural gas  services and equipment  the limited exploration of the concessions  the status of existing and future contractual relationships with ecopetrol  foreign currency fluctuation risks  seven seas substantial indebtedness  the presence of competitors with greater financial resources and capacity  and difficulties and risks associated with operating in colombia 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity risk the market prices for oil and natural gas historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
oil and natural gas prices may fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
decreases in oil and natural gas prices will adversely affect our future revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  decreases in oil and natural gas may impede our ability to raise additional capital 
interest rate risk we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of a fixed interest rate on the million senior notes 
we currently have no open interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses and capital expenditures 
however  because predominately all transactions in our existing foreign operations are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for all operations
