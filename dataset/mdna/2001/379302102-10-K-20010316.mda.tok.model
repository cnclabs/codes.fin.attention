accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
and  effective january  sfas no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all entities recognize them as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and subsequently measure them at fair market value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
the company uses only qualifying hedges that are designated specifically to reduce exposure to interest rate risk by locking in the expected future cash payments on certain liabilities 
this is typically accomplished using an interest rate swap or cap 
for financial reporting purposes  the gain or loss on the effective portion of the interest rate hedge is recorded as a component of equity  which becomes reclassified into earnings along with payments on the hedged liability 
on adoption of sfas no 
in january  the company will record a net transition adjustment of  in accumulated other comprehensive income and  in unrealized loss at that time 
adoption of the standard also results in the company recognizing  of derivative instrument assets 
in general  the amount of volatility will vary with the level of derivative activities during any period 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements which clarified the sec s views regarding various revenue recognition matters 
the company has concluded that no changes in its revenue recognition policies are required as a result of sab and that the accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements continue to be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

during the third quarter of  the company also entered into a five year national agreement to bring the genesisintermedia 
com centerlinq public internet access network to each of its malls 
in addition to internet access  the centerlinq kiosks provide coupons  directories and e mail via a touch screen computer terminal 
the first kiosks are being installed at jersey gardens and university mall and all malls are projected to be on line by the end of the company is also finalizing a program to provide broadband access at each mall with full implementation by year end other the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when tenant occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  malls achieve most of their temporary tenant rents and percentage rents during the holiday season 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
the retail industry has experienced some difficulty  which is reflected in sales trends and in the bankruptcies and continued restructuring of several prominent retail organizations 
continuation of these trends could impact future earnings performance 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the company s properties 
many tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents in the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation may  however  have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest expense and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time
