non trading market risk sensitive instruments investments with interest rate risk fair value the table below provides the operating partnership s potential exposure  measured in terms of fair value  to an immediate basis point increase in interest rates from the levels prevailing at december  a basis point fluctuation in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
while these fair value measurements provide a representation of interest rate sensitivity of fixed income mutual funds and fixed income hedge funds  they are based on the portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future market results 
these exposures will change as a result of ongoing changes in investments in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities in thousands at december  basis point change fixed income investments  investments with equity price risk fair value the operating partnership s investments also include investments in equity mutual funds and equity hedge funds 
the following table provides the operating partnership s potential exposure from those investments  measured in terms of fair value  to an immediate drop in equity prices from those prevailing at december  a decrease in equity prices is a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
while these fair value measurements provide a representation of equity price sensitivity of equity mutual funds and equity hedge funds  they are based on the portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future market results 
these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities in thousands at december  equity price change equity investments   derivative financial instruments fair value the operating partnership utilizes an interest rate cap to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk by effectively placing an interest rate ceiling or cap on interest payable on up to million of the debt outstanding under the operating partnership s commercial paper program and five year revolving credit facility 
the interest rate cap expires in december the million notional principal amount does not represent the operating partnership s exposure to credit risk  but is only a basis to determine the payment obligation of the counterparty 
during the three year term of the interest rate cap  the operating partnership will receive monthly payments from the counterparty based on the excess  if any  of the stated reference rate over times the notional amount 
should the counterparty fail to perform its obligations under the agreement  the operating partnership s borrowing costs on the first million of debt outstanding could exceed 
however  at this time the operating partnership does not have any reason to believe that the counterparty would fail to perform 
while the notional amount is the most commonly used measure of volume in the derivatives market  it is not used by the operating partnership as a measure of risk as the notional amount exceeds the possible loss that could arise from the interest rate cap 
mark to market exposure is a point in time measure of the value of a derivative contract on the open market 
a positive value indicates existence of credit risk for the operating partnership as the counterparty would owe money to the operating partnership if the contract were closed 
at year end  the market value of the operating partnership s derivative was  representing the time value and intrinsic value components of the fair value
