item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward looking 
these statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties as discussed herein and in item of this form k that could cause actual results to differ materially 
results of operations versus for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss for consolidated financial statement purposes of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  on a basic and diluted per share basis  the financial statement loss increased to per share for from per share for the primary factors resulting in the net loss for the year ended december  were the recognition of an accounting charge of million related to the impairment of retained cmbs  the recognition of a net loss of approximately million related to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv  and the recognition of approximately million of impairment related to certain sold cmbs  as discussed further below 
despite the recognition of million in impairment and the loss of million on the sale of certain cmbs during  the impact on book equity of these two events was not material since the company had accounted for these assets at fair value with the related fair value adjustment to the cost basis of the bonds already reflected in equity the segment discussion pertaining to the mortgage servicing cmslp segment is reflected below in equity in earnings losses from investments 
interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs decreased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during this overall decrease in interest income was primarily the result of the sale of certain cmbs the morgan bonds in february  the first union bonds in april  the chase bonds in august  and the dlj and citicorp bonds in november this decrease in interest income was partially offset by the following factors the impairment on certain cmbs resulting in an increase in the subsequent income yields due to a lower cost basis  and an increase in income yields on cmbs due to a change in methodology in determining such yields 
other than temporary impairment was recognized as of december  on the subordinated cmbs that were sold in as part of the cmbs sale under the reorganization plan 
the impairment resulted in the cmbs cost basis being written down to fair value as of december  as a result of this new basis  these cmbs had revised higher yields effective the first quarter of these higher yields resulted in more income being recognized for financial statement purposes 
further  yields on cmbs increased effective april  due to a change in the allocation and timing of loss estimates as discussed further below  which resulted in additional income recognized during the last nine months of generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that interest income earned on subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs 
based upon the timing and amount of future credit losses and certain other assumptions estimated by management  as discussed below  the weighted average anticipated unleveraged yield for criimi mae s subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes as of january  was approximately as compared to the anticipated weighted average yield used to recognize income from april  to december  of and as of december  these yields were determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected weighted average life of the subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses and any other than temporary impairment 
as previously discussed  effective april   the company changed the allocation and timing of the estimated future credit losses related to the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs  as a result of the strong us economy the performance of the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs had been better than management had originally anticipated and credit losses were lower than originally estimated 
therefore  the company revised its estimated credit losses to occur later in the weighted average life of the cmbs than originally projected 
however  at that time  the company did not lower the total amount of estimated future credit losses related to the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs 
the change in allocation and timing of estimated future credit losses to reflect a later occurrence of such losses resulted in increases in projected cash flow primarily in the form of interest income as of april   which in turn resulted in increases in anticipated yields to maturity 
this revised yield was used to recognize interest income from april  through december  as a result of the revised later projected occurrence of credit losses  the yields used to determine cmbs income increased 
through december   the overall impact of this allocation and timing revision resulted in a basis point increase in total cmbs anticipated yields to maturity basis point increase related to the then remaining cmbs subject to the cmbs sale and basis point increase related to the company s retained portfolio 
these yield increases resulted in approximately million in additional cmbs income during the year ended december   compared to income that would have been recognized using prior unrevised yields related to the retained cmbs portfolio 
however  the us economy began to slow during the later part of the year 
accordingly  the company began to see the impact of the slowing us economy through increased defaults in its loan portfolio 
this trend has continued during the first quarter of  and as of march   approximately of the underlying loans in the company s cmbs portfolio are in special servicing 
this compares to and as of december  and  respectively  and as of april  when the company revised its yields upward as discussed above 
as a result of the slowing us economy and the resulting increased defaults  and management s expectation of ensuing loan losses thereon  the company recognized an accounting charge of million for impairment in the fourth quarter related to its cmbs portfolio 
this charge through the income statement does not have a material impact on book equity as the company had carried its cmbs assets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through equity prior to the impairment charge 
as a result of recognizing impairment  the company has  again  revised its anticipated yields as of january   which will be used to recognize interest income prospectively  beginning january  while the company expects lower cash flows from its cmbs portfolio than its previous estimates due to larger than anticipated losses and those estimated losses occuring sooner than expected  the yields will actually increase by basis points because of a reduction in the carrying value of the company s cmbs portfolio to fair value ie cash flows divided by a much lower asset base cause yields to increase see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of criimi mae s subordinated cmbs and the performance of the underlying mortgage loans 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of six mortgage securities held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million during the year ended these prepayments represented approximately of the total insured mortgage portfolio 
interest income originated loans interest income from originated loans decreased by approximately million or to approximately million for as compared to million for interest income from originated loans was derived from originated loans included in the cmo iv securitization  a securitization of million face value of conduit loans in june the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv in november  which reduced interest income for versus in addition  the decrease in interest income was due to the prepayment of two originated loans aggregating million during the year ended interest expense total interest expense decreased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in interest expense on variable rate secured borrowings  reflecting the repayment of such debt after the sale of certain cmbs and the company s interest in cmo iv during also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in interest expense on the fixed rate debt related to the insured securities and on the fixed rate debt issued in the cmo iv securitization 
the company sold its interest in cmo iv during the fourth quarter and  as such  no longer recognizes the interest expense on the original securitization 
these decreases were partially offset by the following a discount amortization adjustment of approximately million related to the insured securities fixed rate obligation debt due to an increase in the estimate of future prepayment speeds during the second quarter of this increase in the estimate of future prepayment speeds was a result of these obligations paying down faster than originally anticipated  the replacement during of a portion of the company s variable rate debt with higher fixed rate debt 
the original sales of such fixed rate securities were treated as a financing for accounting purposes 
as such  the company records the securities as liabilities and recognizes the related interest expense on an ongoing basis 
the fixed rate obligations sold typically carry a higher cost than does the variable rate secured borrowing that it replaces 
and  an increase in variable rate borrowing costs due to higher interest rates in than in equity in earnings losses from investments equity in earnings losses reflects the activity of several of the company s equity investments including cmslp and the company s investment in the aim funds 
equity in earnings increased by approximately million during due to equity in earnings of approximately million as compared to equity in losses of million in the equity in earnings losses is primarily comprised of  and million related to cmslp and  and  related to the aim funds in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   cmslp reported net income of approximately  as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  cmslp total revenues remain relatively unchanged in as compared to  at million for both years 
the total servicing portfolio decreased primarily due to criimi mae s sale of certain cmbs where cmslp previously had the special servicing rights  and because cmslp sold two master servicing contracts during servicing fee income decreased by approximately  or  to million for as compared to million in due to the reduced size of the servicing portfolio 
this reduced income from servicing fees was offset by an increase in assumption fees and other fee income 
cmslp general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the attrition of employees in and an approximate  prepayment loss in cmslp other expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million in as compared to million in this decrease was attributed to the amortization of purchased mortgage servicing rights 
these assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period  of the estimated net income servicing revenue in excess of servicing costs from the servicing rights 
amortization expense also reflects the sale of certain servicing rights during other income other income increased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this increase was primarily attributable to the timing of temporary investments 
also included in other income is approximately  in realized gains related to the company s trading of other mbs 
such trading activities included approximately trades during net gains on mortgage security dispositions during  net gains on mortgage security dispositions were approximately  as a result of six prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  or approximately of its portfolio 
during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million 
for any year  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
the proceeds realized from the disposition of mortgage assets are based on the net coupon rates of the specific mortgages disposed of in relation to prevailing long term interest rates at the date of disposition 
gain on originated loan dispositions during  gains on originated loan dispositions were approximately  as a result of two prepayments in the originated loan portfolio 
as previously stated  the company sold all of its interest in the originated loans during late in  there were five prepayments that resulted in gains on originated loan dispositions of approximately  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or  to million for as compared to million for the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in employment costs from a reduced work force during this period  along with a reduction in certain professional costs 
unrealized loss on warehouse obligations during  the company recorded no unrealized loss on warehouse obligations 
this compares to  when the company recorded unrealized losses of approximately million in connection with the citibank program 
litigation expense during  the company recorded a million expense based on the settlement of the cca claim 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion of this claim and other legal matters 
impairment on cmbs as discussed earlier  as of december  the company revised its overall expected loss estimate related to its cmbs portfolio from million to million  with such estimated losses expected to occur over the life of the investment 
in addition  the company now expects such revised losses to occur sooner than originally expected because of the slowing us economy 
this revised loss estimate is a result of an increase in the number of loans that have been placed in special servicing due primarily to loan defaults 
as of december   million in mortgage loans underlying the company s cmbs portfolio are in special servicing as compared to million as of december  as of march   this amount had grown to million or of the underlying loans in the cmbs portfolio  an increase from when the company revised its yields as of april for reference purposes  the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying the cmbs pool is approximately billion as of march  during and  respectively  the company expects that aggregate losses on the underlying mortgage loans will be approximately million and million in excess of that anticipated when it revised its yields as of april  there can be no assurance that the company s estimate of expected losses will not be exceeded by additional adverse events  such as a continuing economic slowdown 
as the company has determined that the current estimate of expected credit losses exceeds credit losses as previously projected  the company believes its cmbs portfolio has been impaired under fas as the fair value of the cmbs is million below the amortized cost basis as of december   the company recorded an other than temporary impairment charge through the income statement of million during the fourth quarter of except for the a and bbb rated bonds 
unrealized losses related to these cmbs were previously recognized through other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet and as a result the impact of the impairment charge is not material to book equity 
as a result of the other than temporary impairment recognized  the revised amortized cost basis of the cmbs as of december  substantially equals management s estimate of their fair value 
reorganization items reorganization items 
during and  the company recorded reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae  cm management and holdings ii  as follows reorganization items short term interest income   professional fees   employee retention program   other   write off of debt discounts and deferred costs excise tax accrued   subtotal   impairment on cmbs regarding reorganization   impairment on reo  net gain on sale of cmbs  loss on originated loans  total   the company recognized impairment on its investment in real estate owned reo in this asset was sold in july as discussed in note and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the net gain on sale of cmbs 
the company recognized a loss of approximately million on its investment in originated loans 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
impairment on cmbs regarding reorganization 
as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the reorganization plan  a portion of the recapitalization financing resulted from the sale of certain cmbs subject to the cmbs sale  which sale was completed in november the company first filed a plan with the bankruptcy court in the fourth quarter of and during that same quarter criimi mae began marketing for sale the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale 
the company also sold its interest in cmo iv in november as part of the reorganization plan 
gaap states that when the fair market value of an investment declines below its amortized cost for a significant period of time and the entity no longer has the ability or intent to hold the investment for the period the entity anticipates is required for the value to recover to amortized cost  other than temporary impairment on the investment should be recognized 
this other than temporary impairment is recognized through the income statement as the difference between amortized cost and fair value 
additional accounting guidance states that other than temporary impairment should be recognized in the period the decision to sell any investment is made if the entity does not expect the fair value to recover before the sale date 
as the company decided in the fourth quarter of to sell the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale and it did not expect the value of these bonds to significantly recover before the future sale dates  the company recognized approximately million of other than temporary impairment related to these cmbs  cumulatively  through the third quarter of unrealized losses related to the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale were previously recognized through other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the other than temporary impairment loss on cmbs is a reorganization item on the income statement as the impairment was recognized as part of the reorganization plan 
extraordinary item gain on debt extinguishment as part of the reorganization plan  the company s interest in cmo iv was sold in in accordance with eitf debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments  the net loss on the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv is required to be presented as two components consisting of the loss on the sale of the originated loans and the subsequent gain related to the extinguishment of debt 
because the company decided in the third quarter of to sell all of its interest in cmo iv  the investment in originated loans was adjusted from amortized cost to fair value resulting in a million loss in the third quarter which was classified as a reorganization item 
the gain related to the extinguishment of debt was approximately million and was recognized in november as an extraordinary item 
therefore  the net loss related to the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv was approximately million 
taxable loss criimi mae realized a net operating loss of approximately million or per share for the year ended december  compared to net income of approximately million or per share in as previously discussed  as a result of its trader election in early  criimi mae recognized a mark to market tax loss of approximately million on certain trading assets on january  the january loss 
the january loss is expected to be recognized evenly over four years    and for tax purposes ie  approximately million per year beginning with the year the company recognized approximately million of this january loss during the year ended december  a summary of the company s year net operating loss is as follows january loss million less portion recognized in first through fourth quarters of million balance remaining of january loss to be recognized in future periods million taxable income for the year ended december  before recognition of january loss million less january loss recognized in million plus mark to market unrealized gain on trading assets as of december  million net operating loss for the year ended december  million net operating loss through december  million net operating loss utilization million net operating loss carried forward for use in future periods million as of december   the combined fair value of the trading assets approximated billion for tax purposes 
the distinction between taxable income loss and gaap income loss is important to the company s shareholders because dividends or distributions are declared and paid on the basis of taxable income loss 
the company does not pay taxes so long as it satisfies the requirements for exemption from taxation pursuant to the reit requirements of the code 
the company calculates its taxable income  or taxable loss  as if the company were a regular domestic corporation 
this taxable income or taxable loss level determines the amount of dividends  if any  the company is required to pay out over time in order to eliminate its tax liability 
see also reit status and other tax matters  which follows 
results of operations versus for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss for financial statement purposes of approximately million as compared to net income available to common shareholders of approximately million for the year ended december  on a basic per share basis  the financial statement net loss income decreased to per share for from per share for the primary factor resulting in the net loss for the year ended december  was the recognition of million of other than temporary impairment on certain subordinated cmbs 
the impairment is discussed further below 
other factors contributing to the change in earnings from to were an increase in other reorganization costs and other items as more fully discussed below 
the segment discussion pertaining to mortgage servicing cmslp is reflected below in equity in earnings losses from investments 
interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs increased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during there were no subordinated cmbs acquisitions in however  during  the company increased its cmbs portfolio by acquiring subordinated cmbs at purchase prices aggregating approximately million 
the overall increase was partially offset by a reduction in income from subordinated cmbs due to the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs from cbo in connection with cbo and also the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs in connection with cbo see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
gaap requires that interest income generated by subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs 
this has resulted in income that is lower for financial statement purposes than for tax purposes 
based upon the timing and amount of future credit losses and certain other assumptions estimated by management  as discussed below  the estimated weighted average anticipated yield for criimi mae s subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes as of december  was approximately 
these returns were determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected weighted average life of the subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses 
as discussed further below  impairment was recognized as of december  on the subordinated cmbs that were sold in as part of the cmbs sale 
this resulted in the cost basis being written down to fair value as of december  as a result of this new basis  these cmbs had new yields effective the first quarter of interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of mortgage securities held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million during the year ended interest income originated loans interest income from originated loans increased by approximately million or to approximately million for as compared to million for interest income from originated loans was derived from originated loans included in the cmo iv securitization  which resulted in the securitization of million face value of conduit loans in june the increase from to was primarily due to only six months of interest income recognized in  partially reduced by the prepayment of five originated loans in interest expense total interest expense increased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this increase was principally a result of certain financing facilities that were outstanding for the entire year ended december  as compared to a partial year in such financing facilities increased in connection with the acquisition of subordinated cmbs in and the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations in connection with cmo iv during june equity in losses earnings from investments equity in earnings losses reflects the activity of several of the company s equity investments including cmslp and the company s investment in the aim funds 
equity in earnings decreased by approximately million during due to a net loss of approximately million for as compared to equity in earnings of million in equity in earnings losses is primarily comprised of million and million related to cmslp and  and million related to the aim funds in and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in revenue and an increase in certain expenses at cmslp 
the decrease in revenue is primarily due to cmslp s loss of certain servicing rights and the assignment of orix as the successor servicer on those pools during the fourth quarter of the increase in expenses includes an  expense for a prepayment penalty shortfall incurred by cmslp and an increase in general and administrative expenses  including a long term incentive program for cmslp  effective in the fourth quarter of  and other payroll costs 
in addition  expenses increased due to a  write off of a remaining investment balance associated with a now dissolved affiliated entity 
the servicing portfolio was approximately billion as of december  as compared to approximately billion as of december  other income other income decreased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in short term interest and other income earned during on the amounts deposited in the loan origination reserve account  due to suspension of the origination loan program in no interest income was earned on the origination reserve account for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million of short term interest income and net carry income for the decrease was partially offset by an increase in other short term interest income of approximately  in versus net gain on mortgage security dispositions during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million as a result of prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  representing approximately of its portfolio 
during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million  of which approximately  was a result of prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  representing approximately of its portfolio 
the remaining  was the result of the sale of four unencumbered mortgage securities and the partial sale of a fifth unencumbered mortgage security 
gain on originated loan dispositions during  gains on originated loan dispositions were approximately  which was a result of five prepayments in the originated loan portfolio 
no originated loans were disposed of during general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million for as compared to million for the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the closing of regional offices  suspension of certain business activities and the dismissal of employees following the chapter filing in the fourth quarter of losses on warehouse obligations during the year ended december   the company recorded losses of million on its warehouse obligation  primarily due to a decrease in the selling price of the loans in the company s warehouse line with citibank  when the loans were sold in the third quarter of as of december   the unrealized loss recorded on the obligation under the citibank program was million 
the company recorded  in total  a loss of million for this transaction for both gaap and tax purposes 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an unrealized loss of million for its loss exposure under the prudential program 
the company calculated the prudential loss based upon the assumption that the company would not exercise its option with prudential 
as of december   the sole loan originated under the prudential program had not yet been sold 
reorganization items impairment on cmbs 
as the company decided in the fourth quarter of to sell the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale and it did not expect the value of these bonds to significantly recover before the future sale dates  the company recognized approximately million of other than temporary impairment related to these cmbs through earnings in the fourth quarter of unrealized losses related to the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale were previously recognized through other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the other than temporary impairment loss on cmbs is a reorganization item on the income statement as the impairment was recognized as part of the reorganization plan 
other reorganization items 
during and  the company also recorded million and million  respectively  in other reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae  cm management and holdings ii 
other reorganization items short term interest income  professional fees   write off of debt discounts and deferred costs  employee retention program accrued costs   excise tax accrued   other   total   gain on sale of cbo in may  criimi mae completed cbo pursuant to which it sold million of investment grade securities created through the resecuritization of approximately billion of its subordinated cmbs 
criimi mae recognized a gain of approximately million on the sale of million face amount investment grade securities sold without call provisions  recognizing criimi mae s transfer of control on those securities 
certain of these securities included call provisions to enable criimi mae to repurchase bonds if market conditions warrant  and call bonds when it is no longer cost effective to service them 
the sold investment grade securities treated as a financing  as well as approximately billion face amount of investment grade and non investment grade securities retained by criimi mae  are now required to be reflected on criimi mae s balance sheet at their fair market value 
additionally  due to the sale treatment under sfas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities fas  all remaining subordinated cmbs and insured mortgage securities are required to be carried at fair market value 
additionally  as part of cbo  in may  cmslp sold trustee servicing rights for million  resulting in a gain of million for tax purposes  and approximately  for financial reporting purposes 
loss on reverse repurchase obligation during  the company realized a loss of million due to the impact of financial market volatility on hedge positions 
as part of cmo iv  the company intended to sell certain of the investment grade tranches that were not initially sold to the public 
in anticipation of this sale  the company entered into a transaction to hedge the value of those securities in june this transaction did not qualify for hedge accounting purposes because it involved the purchase and sale of a cash instrument and therefore was required to be recorded at market value marked to market 
because treasury rates declined in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million unrealized loss as of september  criimi mae borrowed and then sold a year treasury note in the amount of million  and the loss was realized in the fourth quarter of write off of capitalized loan origination costs since the company no longer had the intention to securitize the remaining loans originated through the citibank and prudential programs in warehouse facilities  the net deferred costs of million associated with the warehoused loans were written off in taxable income criimi mae earned approximately million in tax basis income available to common shareholders in or per share  compared to approximately million or per share in the primary factor resulting in the decrease in taxable income from to was the approximately million tax basis loss realized on the loans sold in the third quarter of from the warehouse line with citibank 
other factors contributing to the decline in tax basis income were the deductions for retention bonuses and professional fees and net decreases in earnings from equity investments 
in the second quarter of  as part of cbo  cmslp sold servicing rights for million resulting in a gain of million for tax purposes  which was included in equity in earnings in partially offsetting the aforementioned items was an increase in net interest margin due to recognition of a full year of interest income and interest expense in as compared to a partial year in  as previously discussed 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to an increase in restricted cash as compared to  representing cash that is restricted due to stipulations entered into in connection with the chapter proceedings or due to agreements that required certain cmbs interest income payments and or cmbs sale proceeds to be held in segregated accounts and an increase in non cash interest income related to discount amortization 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from mortgage securities dispositions and originated loan dispositions 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of cmbs and the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv  net of associated debt 
net cash used in financing activities decreased in as compared to due to a decrease in principal payments on debt obligations 
versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a significant increase in the amount of restricted cash 
partially offsetting this decrease was an overall increase in net payables in as compared to net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to primarily due to the suspension of the company s subordinated cmbs acquisition and origination programs as a result of the chapter filing in october net cash used in financing activities increased in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the suspension of the company s subordinated cmbs acquisition activities  suspension of equity and debt offerings and payment of principal paydowns per the stipulation agreements with secured lenders 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources activities events prior to chapter filing prior to the chapter filing  criimi mae used proceeds from long term  fixed rate match funded debt refinancings  short term  variable rate secured borrowings  unsecured and other borrowings  securitizations and issuances of common and preferred shares to meet the capital requirements of its business plan 
since the chapter filing  the company has suspended its subordinated cmbs acquisition  origination and securitization operations  but continues to service mortgage loans through cmslp 
also prior to the chapter filing  criimi mae financed a substantial portion of its subordinated cmbs acquisitions with short term  variable rate borrowings secured by the company s subordinated cmbs 
the agreements governing these financing arrangements typically required the company to maintain loan to value ratios 
the agreements further provided that the lenders could require the company to post cash or additional collateral if the value of the existing collateral fell below the minimum amount required 
in order to refinance a portion of its short term  variable rate secured borrowings with long term  fixed rate debt  the company entered into resecuritization transactions 
in may  criimi mae completed cbo  its second resecuritization of its subordinated cmbs portfolio  which under fas  qualified for both sale and financing accounting 
through cbo  criimi mae refinanced million of its variable rate debt with fixed rate  match funded debt 
the debt is considered match funded because the maturities and principal requirements of the debt closely match those of the related collateral 
the transaction also generated additional borrowing capacity of approximately million  which was used primarily to fund additional subordinated cmbs purchases 
additionally in june  criimi mae securitized million of originated and acquired commercial mortgage loans by selling million face amount of fixed rate investment grade securities 
the tranches not sold to the public were partially financed with variable rate secured financing agreements 
after the above structured finance transactions  the company continued to have a substantial amount of short term  variable rate secured financing facilities which were subject to the previously discussed collateral requirements based on cmbs security values 
as a result of the turmoil in the capital markets commencing in late summer of  the spreads between cmbs yields and the yields on treasury securities with comparable maturities began to increase substantially and rapidly 
criimi mae s short term secured creditors perceived that the value of the subordinated cmbs securing their facilities with the company had fallen  creating a value deficiency as measured by the loan to value ratio and  consequently  made demand upon the company to provide cash or additional collateral with sufficient value to cure the perceived value deficiency 
in august and september of  the company received and met collateral calls from its secured creditors 
at the same time  criimi mae was in negotiations with various third parties in an effort to obtain additional debt and equity financing that would provide the company with additional liquidity 
on friday afternoon  october   the company was in the closing negotiations of a refinancing with one of its unsecured creditors that would have provided the company with additional borrowings  when it received a significant collateral call from one of its secured creditors 
the basis for this collateral call  in the company s view  was unreasonable 
after giving consideration to  among other things  this collateral call and the company s concern that its failure to satisfy this collateral call would cause the company to be in default under a substantial portion of its financing arrangements  the company reluctantly concluded on sunday  october  that it was in the best interests of creditors  equity holders and other parties in interest to seek chapter protection 
accordingly  on monday  october   the company filed for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court 
summary of certain asset sales  cash position  and shareholders equity during chapter proceedings the company first filed a plan with the bankruptcy court in the fourth quarter of and during that same quarter  began marketing for sale the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale 
criimi mae completed the cmbs sale in november the company also sold its interest in cmo iv in november as part of the reorganization plan 
the cmbs sale and the sale of the company s interest in cmo iv generated aggregate proceeds of approximately million  of which approximately million was used to pay related borrowings and approximately million will be used to help fund the reorganization plan 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these sales 
criimi mae s restricted cash position has increased from approximately million on october  to approximately million as of december  additionally  the company s unrestricted cash position as of december  was approximately million 
see item legal proceedings for information pertaining to agreements reached with certain creditors 
as of april   the company s restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and its very liquid trading assets aggregated approximately million  of which approximately million will be used toward the payment of the allowed claims and estimated professional fees pursuant to the reorganization plan  with a remaining aggregate balance of approximately million 
as of december  and december   respectively  shareholders equity was approximately million and million 
summary of reorganization plan the reorganization plan includes the payment in full of the allowed claims of the debtors primarily through recapitalization financing aggregating million 
as previously discussed  the sales of select cmbs and the company s interest in cmo iv generated aggregate proceeds of approximately million toward the recapitalization financing 
also included in the recapitalization financing is approximately million anticipated to be provided by affiliates of merrill lynch and gacc through a new secured financing facility in the form of a repurchase transaction  and approximately million anticipated to be provided through new secured notes issued to certain of the company s unsecured creditors 
in connection with the reorganization plan  substantially all cash flows relating to existing assets are expected to be used to satisfy principal  interest and fee obligations under the new debt 
the approximate million secured financing would provide for i interest at a rate of one month london interbank offered rate libor plus  ii principal repayment amortization obligations  iii extension fees after two years and iv maturity on the fourth anniversary of the effective date of the reorganization plan 
the approximate million secured financing would be effected through the issuance of two series of secured notes under two separate indentures 
the first series of secured notes  representing an aggregate principal amount of approximately million  would provide for i interest at a rate of per annum  ii principal repayment amortization obligations  iii extension fees after four years and iv maturity on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the reorganization plan 
the second series of secured notes  representing an aggregate principal amount of approximately million  would provide for i interest at a rate of per annum with additional interest at the rate of per annum accreting over the debt term  ii extension fees after four years and iii maturity on the sixth anniversary of the effective date of the reorganization plan 
the new debt described above is anticipated to be secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
it is contemplated that there will be restrictive covenants  including financial covenants and certain restrictions and requirements with respect to cash accounts and the collection  management  use and application of funds  in connection with the new debt 
due to the uncertainty of the effects of the chapter filing on the business of the company  pending litigation and numerous other factors beyond the control of the company  no assurance can be given that the company s cash flow will be sufficient to fund operations for any specified period while the company is in bankrupcty 
assuming the reorganization plan becomes effective  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient cash resources to pay interest  scheduled principal and any other required payments on the new debt for any specified period to time 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations will depend on a number of factors  including management s ability to maintain cash flow which is impacted by  among other things  the credit performance of the underlying mortgage loans and to generate capital internally from operating and investing activities and expected reductions in reit distribution requirements to shareholders due to expected net operating losses for tax purposes  in each case consistent with the terms agreed to pursuant to the new debt 
there can be no assurance that targeted levels of cash flow will actually be achieved  that reductions in reit distribution requirements will be realized  or that  if required  new capital will be available to the company 
the company s ability to maintain or increase cash flow and access new capital will depend upon  among other things  interest rates  prevailing economic conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s high level of debt limits its ability to obtain additional capital  reduces income available for distributions  restricts the company s ability to react quickly to changes in its business and makes the company more vulnerable to economic downturns 
see also item business risk factors for additional discussion 
the company s ability to resume the acquisition of more significant subordinated cmbs  as well as its securitization programs if it determines to do so depends  among other things  first  on its ability to emerge from bankruptcy as a successfully reorganized company  and second  on its ability to access additional capital  including for the purpose of refinancing all or a substantial portion of the new debt  once it has successfully emerged from chapter factors which could affect the company s ability to access additional capital include  among other things  the cost and availability of such capital  changes in interest rates and interest rate spreads  changes in the commercial mortgage industry and the commercial real estate market  general economic conditions  perceptions in the capital markets of the company s business  covenants and restrictions under the company s new debt and credit facilities  results of operations  leverage  financial condition  and business prospects 
the company can give no assurance as to whether it will be able to obtain additional capital or the terms of any such capital

the remaining approximately represents investment grade securities that the company reflects on its balance sheet as a result of cbo the weighted average interest rate on these cmbs as of december  was and the weighted average life was years 
the company s unrated bonds from cbo  cbo and nomura experienced principal write downs during the following periods due to realized losses related to certain underlying mortgage loans cbo cbo nomura year  year   january  through march    cumulative realized losses through march    criimi mae  through cmslp  performs servicing functions on a total cmbs pool  including the sub special servicer for specially serviced loans  as summarized below total cmbs pool billion billion c billion specially serviced loans due to monetary default a b million million million specially serviced loans due to covenant default other million million million total specially serviced loans d million million million a includes million  million  and million of real estate owned by underlying trusts 
b the increase in the specially serviced loans is due primarily to an increase in unforeseen defaults related to commercial mortgage loans secured principally by retail and hotel properties  which have been adversely impacted by the recent economic slowdown

d as of december   the company recorded an impairment charge of million as a result of its revised estimate of credit losses in the cmbs pool  as previously discussed 
appraisal reductions for the cmbs transactions in which the company retains an ownership interest as reported by the underlying trustees or as calculated by cmslp were as follows cbo cbo nomura year year   january  through march     cumulative appraisal reductions through march     not all underlying cmbs transactions require the calculation of an appraisal reduction  however  where cmslp obtains a third party appraisal it calculates one for the purpose of estimating potential losses 
the effect of an appraisal reduction  for those underlying cmbs transactions that require an appraisal reduction to be calculated  generally is that the servicer stops advancing interest payments on the unrated bonds or if no unrated bond  the lowest rated bond as if such appraisal reduction was a realized loss 
however  an appraisal reduction may result in a higher or lower realized loss based on the ultimate disposition or work out of the mortgage loan

on january   the company received written notice from the new york stock exchange that it was below criteria for continued listing on the exchange because the average closing price of its common stock was less than over a consecutive thirty trading day period 
the company has six months from january  to raise its common stock price above the level and the failure of the common stock to average over the trading days preceding the expiration of the six month cure period will result in commencement of suspension and delisting procedures 
reit status and other tax matters criimi mae has elected to qualify as a reit for tax purposes under sections of the internal revenue code for the tax year 
to qualify for tax treatment as a reit under the internal revenue code  criimi mae must satisfy certain criteria  including certain requirements regarding the nature of its ownership  assets  income and distributions of taxable income 
for a discussion of reit status and related risks see item business chapter filing and reit status and other tax matters 
the recently issued internal revenue service revenue procedure provides securities and commodities traders with the ability to elect mark to market treatment for by including an election with their timely filed federal tax extension 
the election applies to all future years as well  unless revoked with the consent of the internal revenue service 
on march   the company determined to elect mark to market treatment as a securities trader for and  accordingly  will recognize gains and losses prior to the actual disposition of its securities 
moreover  some if not all of those gains and losses  as well as some if not all gains or losses from actual dispositions of securities  will be treated as ordinary in nature and not capital  as they would be in the absence of the election 
therefore  any net operating losses generated by the company s trading activity will offset the company s taxable income  and reduce any required distributions to shareholders by a like amount 
see business risk factors risks associated with trader election for further discussion 
if the company does have a reit distribution requirement and such distributions would be permitted under the reorganization plan  a substantial portion of the company s distributions would be in the form of non cash taxable dividends

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates related to the us treasury market  and increases in the spread between us treasury bonds and cmbs  as well as the libor market 
the company will have an increase in the amount of interest expense paid on its variable rate obligations primarily due to increases in one month libor 
the company will also experience fluctuations in the market value of its assets related to changes in the interest rates of us treasury bonds as well as increases in the spread between us treasury bonds and cmbs 
criimi mae has entered into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the adverse effects of rising interest rates on the amount of interest expense payable under its variable rate borrowings 
the agreements provide protection to criimi mae to the extent interest rates  based on a readily determinable interest rate index typically one month libor  increase above the stated interest rate cap  in which case  criimi mae will receive payments based on the difference between the index and the cap 
the term of the cap as well as the stated cap rate of the cap  which in all cases is currently above the current rate of the index  will limit the amount of protection that the caps offer 
prior to the petition date  criimi mae financed a substantial portion of its subordinated cmbs acquisitions with short term  variable rate borrowings secured by the company s cmbs 
the agreements governing these financing arrangements typically required the company to maintain collateral at all times with a market value not less than a specified percentage of the outstanding indebtedness 
the agreements further provided that the lenders could require the company to post cash or additional collateral if the value of the existing collateral fell below this threshold amount 
these financing arrangements were used by criimi mae to provide financing during the period of time from the acquisition or creation of the subordinated cmbs to the date when criimi mae would resecuritize the portfolio in order to match fund a significant portion of the portfolio with fixed rate debt  thereby eliminating interest rate risk on that portion of the cmbs 
these transactions also increased the borrowing capacity of the company which was used to acquire subordinated cmbs
