quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
additionally  funds available from investment activities are dependent upon available investment rates 
these funds may be higher or lower than anticipated due to interest rate volatility 
capital market risk 
the company currently has no product revenues and is dependent on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through further equity offerings 
the ability of the company to raise funds in this manner is dependent upon capital market forces affecting the stock price of the company
