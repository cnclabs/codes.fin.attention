introduction in the past years  the number of people over the age of began to grow significantly faster than the overall population 
at the same time  advances in medical technology have increased the life expectancies of an increasingly large number of medically complex patients 
this trend  combined with the implementation of healthcare cost containment measures by private insurers and government reimbursement programs  has created a need for a more cost efficient alternate site for the provision of a wide range of medical and rehabilitative services which traditionally have been provided in an acute care hospital 
to address this need  the company has developed medical specialty units within its geriatric care facilities 
the company opened its first msu in april in conjunction with healthsouth rehabilitation corporation  and as of december  operated msus totaling  beds 
the company s strategy generally has been to acquire geriatric care facilities and to implement in such facilities specialty medical services programs  such as msus  to treat the more medically complex patient 
beginning in  the company began to expand the range of related services it offers to its patients directly in order to serve the full spectrum of patients post acute care needs 
the company is now able to offer directly to its patients  rather than through third party providers  a continuum of care following discharge from an acute care hospital 
ihs post acute services include sub acute care  home care  inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation  hospice and diagnostic services 
general basic medical services the company includes in basic medical services revenues all room and board charges for its geriatric care patients other than patients in its msu and alzheimer s programs at its owned and leased geriatric care and assisted living facilities

the decrease in the percentage of basic medical services revenues received from private pay sources and medicare from to and the commensurate increase in the percentage received from medicaid was primarily the result of the higher level of medicaid patients in the geriatric care facilities in which the company acquired ownership or leasehold interests 
the company seeks to increase the percentage of basic medical services revenues received from private pay sources and medicare 
changes in the mix of the company s patients among the private pay  medicare and medicaid categories can significantly affect the profitability of the company s operations 
generally  private pay patients constitute the most profitable category of patients and medicaid patients the least profitable 
the occupancy percentages for those beds from which basic medical services revenues are derived are shown in the table below 
the percentages are calculated both on the basis of the weighted average number of beds licensed regardless of whether such beds are actually available for the provision of basic medical services and the weighted average number of beds in service for the period 
in certain facilities the company temporarily operates fewer beds than it is licensed to operate so as to permit routine maintenance and to accommodate patients desiring private rooms 
in addition  the company has removed beds from service for extended periods as certain facilities have undergone construction projects for expansion purposes and to implement its medical specialty units 
all revenues derived from licensed beds located in msus or used in the renaissance program are included in specialty medical services revenues  accordingly  such beds are not considered beds licensed or beds in service for purposes of determining occupancy for those beds from which basic medical services revenues are derived 
years ended december  beds licensed

as a result  the company incurred a loss of million 
such loss consists of the write off of million of management fees  million of loans made to crestwood hospital and the owners of crestwood  as well as the interest thereon  and million of contract acquisition costs 
during the third quarter of  the company merged with integracare  inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests

the company s strategy of expanding its specialty medical services and growing through acquisitions may require additional borrowings in order to finance working capital  capital expenditures and the purchase price of any acquisitions 
the degree to which the company is leveraged  as well as its rent expense  could have important consequences to holders of the company s securities  including i ihs ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  ii a substantial portion of ihs cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and rent expense  thereby reducing the funds available to ihs for its operations  iii certain of ihs borrowings bear  and will continue to bear  variable rates of interest  which expose ihs to increases in interest rates  and iv certain of ihs indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants  including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the creation of liens  the payment of dividends and sales of assets and imposing minimum net worth requirements 
in addition  ihs leverage may also adversely affect ihs ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions or continue its growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that ihs operating results will be sufficient for the payment of ihs indebtedness 
on october   moody s placed ihs indebtedness on creditwatch for possible downgrade in anticipation of the pending acquisition of coram due to the substantial additional indebtedness of coram 
any such downgrade could increase the company s borrowing costs 
if ihs were unable to meet interest  principal or lease payments  or satisfy financial covenants  it could be required to seek renegotiation of such payments and or covenants or obtain additional equity or debt financing 
to the extent ihs finances its activities with additional debt  ihs may become subject to certain financial and other covenants that may restrict its ability to pursue its growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful or timely or that the terms of any such financing or refinancing would be acceptable to ihs 
the company s growth strategy requires substantial capital for the acquisition of additional home healthcare and related service providers and geriatric care facilities and the establishment of new  and expansion of existing  msus 
the effective integration  operation and expansion of the existing businesses will also require substantial capital 
ihs expects to finance new acquisitions from a combination of funds from operations  borrowings under its bank credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
ihs may raise additional capital through the issuance of long term or short term indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities in private or public transactions  at such times as management deems appropriate and the market allows 
any of such financings could result in dilution of existing equity positions  increased interest and amortization expense or decreased income to fund future expansion 
there can be no assurance that acceptable financing for future acquisitions or for the integration and expansion of existing businesses and operations can be obtained 
the company s bank credit facility limits ihs ability to make acquisitions  and certain of the indentures under which ihs outstanding subordinated debt securities were issued limit ihs ability to incur additional indebtedness unless certain financial tests are met
