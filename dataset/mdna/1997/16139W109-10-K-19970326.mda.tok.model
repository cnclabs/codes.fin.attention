item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent industry performance the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry has historically been highly cyclical 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by prevailing market conditions  including the underwriting results of primary insurers 
the supply of reinsurance is primarily related to levels of underwriting capacity in the reinsurance industry and the relative cost and terms of reinsurance coverage 
the industry s profitability and the cyclical trends in the industry can be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including the occurrence of natural disasters  other catastrophic events  competitive pressures on pricing premium rates  fluctuations in interest rates  other variations in the investment environment  changes in the judicial system regarding tort law  general economic conditions and trends  such as inflationary pressures  that may tend to affect the size of profits and losses experienced by ceding primary insurers and other factors such as changes in tax laws and regulations 
many sectors of the industry are currently in a cyclical downturn and it cannot be predicted if or when market conditions will improve or when other sectors may experience a deterioration in pricing and terms 
inadequate pricing during the latter s and early s led to increased underwriting losses and a decline in underwriting capacity 
reinsurance rates and terms improved substantially during the mid s as primary insurers  which had been adversely affected by the soft market of the previous several years  increased their demand for reinsurance 
reinsurers achieved improved underwriting results and  consequently  the supply of reinsurance capacity increased  both from existing companies and new entrants 
commencing in the latter part of the s  primary property and casualty insurers began to retain more of their business 
this reduction in the amount of business ceded to reinsurers  combined with the growth in reinsurance capacity  resulted in renewed price competition and less attractive pricing for reinsurers 
this caused a downturn for the reinsurance industry  resulting in increased underwriting losses which have continued to the present 
the following table presents the statutory combined ratios of chartwell  the property and casualty reinsurance industry and the property and casualty insurance industry during the to years 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned and the underwriting expense ratio underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written 
a combined ratio of over indicates unprofitable underwriting 
although an insurance company s underwriting may be unprofitable  the company may be profitable after including investment income

chartwell realized a million net profit in compared with a net loss of million in because of the factors discussed above 
preferred dividends and accretion 
preferred dividends and accretion were million for such amount includes a cash conversion incentive payment of million made to preferred stockholders associated with chartwell s refinancing 
all of the preferred stock was converted to common stock as part of the refinancing 
liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  chartwell s assets consist primarily of the stock of its direct and indirect subsidiaries  chartwell reinsurance  inscorp  archer  and chartwell advisers 
chartwell s cash flow  therefore  depends largely on dividends and other payments from re holdings  and in turn re holdings cash flow depends largely on interest  dividends and tax sharing payments from chartwell reinsurance 
chartwell reinsurance s sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums  reinsurance recoveries  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
funds are applied primarily to payments of claims  operating expenses and income taxes and to the purchase of investments  largely fixed income securities 
cash and short term investments are maintained for the payment of claims and expenses 
chartwell reinsurance s ability to pay cash dividends to the company is restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authority of minnesota  chartwell reinsurance s state of domicile 
the minnesota authority recognizes only statutory accounting practices for the ability of an insurer to pay dividends to its stockholders 
for the years ended december   and  chartwell s consolidated cash flow provided by operations was million  million and million  respectively

trading activity increased during the second and third quarters of primarily to modify the portfolio by sector and to capitalize on some opportunities to improve on credit quality without sacrificing yield 
much of the activity that occurred in was due to changes in chartwell s investment guidelines which called for a repositioning of the portfolio into higher yielding securities as interest rates trended upward  particularly at the short end of the yield curve 
during this period  chartwell kept durations short and reduced its exposure to corporate bonds by selling longer maturity corporate bonds in favor of shorter maturity securities 
at december   the carrying value of total investments  including cash and cash equivalents  increased by million  or  to million compared to million at december  the primary reasons for the increase were i the net cash proceeds from the public offering and subsequent exercise of the underwriters over allotment option of million  ii positive cash flow from operations of million  iii assets relating to the archer acquisition of million  and iv million of miscellaneous sources of cash offset by i million for the retirement of of the senior notes plus accrued interest  ii the decline in the market value of the investment portfolio of million pre tax and iii million for the cost of purchasing archer shares 
at december   of chartwell s total investments including cash and cash equivalents consisted of fixed income securities  of which were rated a or better or a for commercial paper by moody s 
while uncertainties exist regarding interest rates and inflation  chartwell attempts to minimize such risks and exposures by balancing the duration of reinsurance liabilities with the duration of assets in its investment portfolio 
the current market value of chartwell s fixed maturity investments is not necessarily indicative of their future valuation 
chartwell does not have any investments in real estate or high yield bonds and does not have any non income producing fixed income investments 
the company s fixed income securities portfolio at december  was comprised primarily of us treasury and government agency  mortgage pass through securities  and corporate and municipal bonds 
financing activities have also been a source of liquidity for chartwell and its subsidiaries 
on march   chartwell completed the offering of million principal amount of the senior notes 
net proceeds of million after transaction expenses were received by chartwell and were used as follows o million was contributed to the statutory surplus of chartwell reinsurance 
o million was used to retire the remaining amount outstanding under the senior term loan at par 
o million  the remaining proceeds  was held by chartwell for working capital 
concurrently with the senior notes offering  as part of the refinancing  i all outstanding shares of two series of chartwell s preferred stock were converted to common stock  ii all outstanding shares of the remaining series of preferred stock were redeemed for a nominal consideration and iii the holders of certain warrants issued in connection with chartwell s subordinated debentures referred to above exercised their right to acquire common stock and in connection therewith  all the outstanding subordinated debentures were retired 
on may   chartwell terminated an interest rate swap transaction it had entered into in april with a notional amount of million to hedge the fixed interest rate on the senior notes 
the effect on the financial statements of this swap was a reduction of interest expense of million for the year ended december  and million in in connection with the establishment prior to the merger of re holdings as an intermediate level holding company for chartwell s operations  all of chartwell s obligations under the senior notes were assumed by re holdings  and chartwell was released from any further obligations under the senior notes 
in the first half of  the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
the net proceeds to the company were million after deduction of underwriting discount and expenses 
of the net proceeds  million was contributed to re holdings of which million was contributed to the statutory surplus of chartwell reinsurance and million was used to retire of the senior notes plus accrued interest 
the remaining funds were retained for general corporate purposes 
this redemption reduced chartwell s annual expense for interest and amortization of debt issuance costs under the senior notes by million per year 
as a result of the offering  standard poor s improved its rating with respect to the senior notes to bbb from bb and moody s improved its rating to ba from ba due in part to the merger and the above transactions  the statutory surplus of chartwell reinsurance  determined in accordance with sap  increased from million at december  to over million at december  in connection with the merger  re holdings entered into the fleet loan and the fleet revolver 
at the time of the merger  re holdings borrowed the full amount under the fleet loan and used the proceeds to repay in full piedmont s existing bank debt 
the fleet loan had a seven year term subject to two one year extensions and required equal annual repayments of principal after the first year 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this bank facility because it was replaced by the new credit facilities described below 
in connection with the acquisition  re holdings entered into the new credit facilities 
the new credit facilities provide for i a term a million loan  ii a term a million loan  iii a term b million loan denominated in pounds sterling  and iv a million revolving credit facility subsequently increased to million 
on november  re holdings borrowed the full amount under the term a loan and used the proceeds to repay the fleet loan in full 
on november  re holdings borrowed the full amount under the term a loan  million under the term b loan  and million under the first union revolver to acquire archer shares 
in addition  on november  re holdings accessed an additional million under the term b loan to guarantee certain loan notes used to acquire archer shares 
subsequently  re holdings paid down million of the first union revolver in order to provide capacity to issue certain letters of credit in connection with the capitalization of oak dedicated limited  a corporate vehicle formed by chartwell to provide capacity to selected syndicates managed by archer 
letters of credit  denominated in pounds sterling  totaling million were issued on november  and are currently outstanding 
the amounts denominated in pounds sterling were converted to us dollars at the rate of per pound  the rate in effect on december  the first union loans have six year terms and the first union revolver has a five year term but may be extended for one year with the consent of first union 
term loans a and a require repayment of principal starting in year  million  year  million  year  million and year  million 
term loan b requires repayment of principal starting in year  million  year  million  year  million and year  million 
borrowings under the first union revolver are available at any time prior to maturity  subject to minimum funding amounts 
both the first union loans and the first union revolver will bear interest at a rate selected by re holdings equal to either the base rate as defined below or london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin the margin 
the amount of the margin will depend on the higher of re holdings senior debt rating by standard poor s or moody s 
the margin can range from to 
based on re holdings current senior debt ratings  the margin over libor would be  compared to the margin under re holdings prior credit agreement with fleet of 
the base rate is the higher of first union s prime commercial lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
re holdings will also pay an unused commitment fee equal to on the aggregate unused portion of the revolver  utilization fees for the issuance of letters of credit and loan note guarantees at a rate per annum of if secured or the margin if unsecured on the outstanding amount of potential credit exposure  and certain other fees customary in connection with syndicated loans of this nature 
at december   million  million  million and million was outstanding under the term a  term a  term b loans and the first union revolver  respectively 
in addition  at december   million was used under the term b loan to guarantee the loan notes and million of letters of credit were extended under the first union revolver 
upon consummation of the merger  chartwell became the successor to piedmont under the ci notes 
the ci notes do not require any interest payments until maturity or earlier redemption or repurchase 
under certain circumstances  the ci notes may be settled by delivery of shares of common stock 
chartwell and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future  subject to the limitations contained in the senior notes indenture  the agreements governing the new credit facilities and the ci notes indenture 
chartwell is largely dependent upon receipt of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from re holdings to meet its obligations and to pay dividends on the common stock 
re holdings is in turn largely dependent on interest  dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations  including the obligation to pay interest and principal on the senior notes and under the new credit facilities 
the agreements governing the foregoing debt obligations significantly restrict the ability of re holdings to make dividend and other payments to chartwell 
further  dividend payments by chartwell reinsurance and inscorp are subject to limits under the laws of the states of minnesota and new york  respectively 
under the applicable provisions of the insurance holding company laws of the state of minnesota  chartwell reinsurance may  upon five days notice to the commissioner following the declaration of dividends to stockholders  and upon at least ten days notice to the commissioner prior to dividend payments  pay dividends to re holdings without the approval of the commissioner  unless such dividends  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  exceed the greater of i of chartwell reinsurance s policyholders surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or ii chartwell reinsurance s statutory net income  excluding realized capital gains  for the prior calendar year 
any dividend in excess of the amount determined pursuant to the foregoing formula would be characterized as an extraordinary dividend requiring the prior approval of the commissioner 
in any case  the maximum amount of dividends chartwell reinsurance may pay is limited to its earned surplus  also known as unassigned funds 
as of december   chartwell reinsurance reported unassigned funds in the amount of million 
up to million is available under the foregoing formula for the payment of dividends by chartwell reinsurance without regulatory approval in chartwell reinsurance paid chartwell no dividends in  or under new york law  which is applicable to inscorp  the maximum ordinary dividend payable in any twelve month period without the approval of the superintendent may not exceed the lesser of a of policyholders surplus as shown on the company s last annual statement or any more recent quarterly statement or b the company s adjusted net investment income 
adjusted net investment income is defined as net investment income for the twelve months preceding the declaration of the dividend plus the excess  if any  of net investment income over dividends declared or distributed during the period commencing thirty six months prior to the declaration or distribution of the current dividend and ending twelve months prior thereto 
in any case  new york law permits the payment of an ordinary dividend by an insurer or reinsurer only out of earned surplus 
moreover  notwithstanding the receipt of any dividend from inscorp  chartwell reinsurance may make dividend payments to re holdings only to the extent permitted under the minnesota provisions described above 
in addition to the foregoing limitation  the new york insurance department  as is its practice in any change of control situation  has required chartwell to commit to preclude the acquired new york domiciled insurer  inscorp  from paying any dividends for two years after the change of control without prior regulatory approval 
the maximum dividend permitted by law is not indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends  which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations  such as the impact of dividends on surplus  which could affect an insurer s ratings or competitive position  the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends 
furthermore  beyond the limits described in the preceding paragraph  the commissioner and superintendent have discretion to limit the payment of dividends by insurance companies domiciled in minnesota and new york  respectively 
management believes that current levels of cash flow from operations and assets held at the holding company level provide the company with sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs in the short term over the next months  including the payment of interest on the senior notes and the new credit facilities 
management expects chartwell to be able to continue to meet its operating needs after the next months from internally generated funds 
since the ability of chartwell to meet its obligations in the long term beyond such month period is dependent upon such factors as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating needs 
the company expects that  in order to repay the principal amount of the senior notes on maturity or otherwise  it will be required to seek additional financing or engage in asset sales or similar transactions  and would be required to take similar actions in order to repay the ci notes on maturity or otherwise  in the event it chose or was required to settle the ci notes in cash rather than common stock 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds for any of the foregoing purposes would be available to the company at such time 
accounting standards accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which became effective for the company beginning january  sfas no

if a purpose for holding the derivative financial instrument is to hedge anticipated transactions  sfas no 
requires disclosure about the anticipated transactions  any hedging gain or loss deferred and the transactions or other events that result in the recognition of the deferred amounts 
regulatory accounting practices management does not believe that current accounting changes being contemplated by regulatory authorities  if implemented  would have a significant effect on the operations or liquidity of chartwell 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on chartwell are considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on chartwell s results cannot be accurately determined until ultimate losses are settled

naic iris ratios the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure by an insurer from the usual values on four or more of the ratios generally leads to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of such insurer s business 
departure from a usual value does not necessarily indicate an adverse condition  but rather a deviation from the norm 
for the year ended december   chartwell reinsurance fell outside the range of usual iris values with respect to the change in writings ratio 
this unusual value resulted from continued growth with existing and new clients in all client segments 
for the year ended december   inscorp fell outside the range of usual iris values with respect to the change in writings ratio  due to the non renewal of its reinsurance portfolio  as well as for the two year overall operating ratio and the two year reserve development to surplus ratio 
the unusual values for these ratios were primarily caused by a million strengthening in net reserves for losses incurred but not reported in calendar year with respect to inscorp s business written in prior years
