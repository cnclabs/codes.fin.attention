overview jda is an international provider of comprehensive enterprise wide software solutions that address the mission critical business information requirements of retailing organizations 
prior to the company s formation in march  the company s operations were conducted by five companies which were operated under common control and management  the first of which was formed in november in march  the predecessor companies were consolidated under a common holding company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of the predecessor companies operated as s corporations for tax purposes prior to the reorganization 
thus  for periods prior to the reorganization  the company s historical statements of operations do not include a provision for us federal income taxes and reflect certain tax strategies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the company introduced mms  its first enterprise retail information solution  based on the ibm as platform 
the company s development efforts through were focused exclusively on enhancements  revisions and upgrades to mms  which is currently in its fourth generation release 
in  the company acquired dss  an in store system  from jda software services ltd 
jda canada  a then unaffiliated canadian company 
since the company has significantly increased its product development expenditures to develop products for emerging  open platforms 
as a result of these efforts  the company commercially released odbms  an open  client server enterprise system  in september  and win dss  a windows based in store system  in january on august  the company acquired jda canada in exchange for  shares of the company s newly issued common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the company recorded million in goodwill which it is amortizing over years 
the company has historically derived the substantial majority of its revenues from software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services relating to mms  and the company expects that revenues related to mms will continue to comprise a substantial portion of the company s total revenues for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  the company expects that revenues related to mms  which accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively  will continue to decline as a percentage of the company s total revenues as market acceptance of the company s newer products  particularly odbms and win dss  increases 
the company further expects that revenues attributable to the license of mms and odbms enterprise systems will comprise the substantial majority of software licenses revenues for the foreseeable future 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are derived from a range of services  including system design and implementation and  to a lesser extent  software maintenance and support  and training 
historically  the level of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues has approximated on an annual basis the level of software license revenues 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues were of total revenues in each of   and gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services has historically been significantly lower than gross margin on software licenses and the company expects this relationship to continue 
consulting  maintenance and other services in support of international licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower prevailing billing rates in certain of the company s international markets 
therefore  any growth in the company s international operations would likely result in further declines in gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services 
the company is pursuing a strategy of addressing international markets by developing localized versions of its products and establishing international subsidiaries with direct sales and consulting capabilities 
international revenues  which include revenues from international subsidiaries and export sales  comprised  and  respectively  of total revenues in each of  and the company has operations in the uk  singapore  canada  chile  mexico and germany and plans to continue to expand its international infrastructure 
the company anticipates that international revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s international expansion will be successful 
in addition  the opening of new offices by the company typically results in initial recruiting  training and other start up expenses in advance of anticipated revenues and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new customer base 
other risks inherent in the company s international business activities include changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  currency fluctuations  repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of local laws 
to the extent the company s international operations expand  the company expects that an increasing portion of its international license and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  the company has conducted a substantial majority of its business in currencies which have been relatively stable  and exposure to fluctuations in such currencies has been considered minimal 
accordingly  the company does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as the company continues to expand its international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
there can be no assurance that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from non refundable license fees for its software products and from fees for services complementary to its products  including software consulting  maintenance and training 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
accordingly  software license revenue is recognized upon the shipment of a product to the customer if collection is probable and the company s remaining obligations under the license agreement are insignificant 
license revenues for licenses with remaining significant obligations are deferred until the company s related obligations become insignificant 
consulting  maintenance and other services are performed and billed under separate agreements related to the implementation of the company s software products  and such revenues generally are recorded when the services are performed 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades are billed on a monthly basis and are recorded as revenue in the applicable month

software licenses 
software license revenues were million  million and million in   and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in was primarily attributable to an increase in international revenues resulting from expanded sales and marketing efforts by the company during that period  partially offset by a decline in domestic mms license revenues due in part to competitive pricing pressures 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the expansion of the company s sales and marketing efforts in all markets and  to a lesser extent  to the commercial release of the company s odbms software in september and the acquisition of jda canada in august consulting  maintenance and other services

cost of software licenses consists primarily of royalties payable for licensing of third party software incorporated in the company s products and commissions payable to third parties on sales of the company s products 
cost of software licenses was   and  in  and  respectively  representing less than of software license revenues in each of these periods 
cost of consulting  maintenance and other services 
cost of consulting  maintenance and other services consists primarily of consultant salaries and other personnel related expenses incurred in system implementation projects and software support services 
these costs were million  million and million  representing  and  respectively  of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues in  and the increase in these costs as a percentage of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues from to was primarily due to expenditures associated with the company s international expansion and the increase from to was primarily due to the increased percentage of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues attributable to international installations  which typically generate lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower prevailing billing rates in certain of the company s international markets 
the company anticipates that the costs of consulting  maintenance and other services will increase during both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues due to the substantial increase in the number of consulting personnel the company anticipates hiring during that period 
in their first year of employment by the company  new consulting personnel typically spend between and weeks in training  during which period they do not generally generate revenues 
operating expenses product development 
product development expenses increased by from million in to million in and by to million in  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in these periods 
increased product development expenses in and were primarily a result of an increase in the number of product development personnel from at december  to at december  and to as of december  significant product development efforts in included the continued development and initial beta release of odbms  continued enhancements to mms and initial development of win dss 
significant product development efforts in included the continued development of odbms and win dss and continued enhancements to mms 
the company believes that a continued commitment to product development will be required for the company to remain competitive 
accordingly  the company intends to continue to allocate substantial resources to product development 
the company expects that product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but may vary as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
product development costs subsequent to the achievement of technological feasibility have not been significant during these periods and  accordingly  all such costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and by to million in  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in these periods 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to the addition of sales and marketing personnel to implement the company s strategy to increase its presence in international and domestic markets 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars in due to continued additions to sales and marketing personnel and related expenses but decreased as a percentage of total revenues due to the significant increase in total revenues

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in and increased by to million in  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues 
the increase in was primarily due to the addition of administrative personnel required to support the company s growth  increased legal and accounting expenses and increased bad debt allowance 
the increase in absolute dollars of general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to the continued addition of personnel and increased legal and accounting expenses 
the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as the company continues to add administrative personnel  but may vary as a percentage of total revenues 
provision for income taxes 
substantially all us federal taxable income through march  was attributed to predecessor companies stockholders  reflecting the prior s corporation status of certain predecessor companies 
accordingly  the company s tax provisions do not include us federal income taxes through that date 
the pro forma income tax provisions reflected in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements include tax provisions for us federal income taxes and reflect effective tax rates of  and for the years  and  respectively 
such tax rates approximate statutory federal  state and foreign tax rates after a reduction for us research and development expense tax credits

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

these expenditures were primarily for property and equipment  comprised of computer hardware and furniture and fixtures  to support its growth 
in  the company also purchased the building it was leasing in the uk for million 
in march  the company submitted an offer to purchase an additional building in the uk for million 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  bank line of credit and funds generated from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
business risks the company s business is subject to a number of risks 
a comprehensive summary of such risks can be found in the company s registration statement on form s file no 
 which was declared effective on november  fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future 
these fluctuations may be caused by many factors  including  among others the size and timing of individual orders  competitive pricing pressures  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  variation of consulting  maintenance and other services as a percentage of total revenues  timing of introduction or enhancement of products by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in platforms supporting the company s products  changes in networking or communication technology  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates  fluctuations in the level of warranty claims  and general industry and economic conditions 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience some degree of seasonality due in large part to its retail customers buying cycles  with license revenues typically higher in the fourth quarter and consulting revenues typically higher in the first quarter 
further  software license gross margin is significantly greater than consulting  maintenance and other services gross margin 
as a result  overall gross margin has fluctuated significantly based on revenue mix  and the company expects this trend to continue 
historically  a significant portion of the company s quarterly revenues have been derived from relatively large licenses to a limited number of customers  and the company currently anticipates that this trend will continue 
any significant cancellation or deferral of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results in any particular quarter 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
licenses of the company s products are typically accompanied by a significant amount of systems implementation consulting 
the company s consulting resources must be managed to meet future sales  and additional consulting personnel must be hired and trained in advance of anticipated license revenues 
the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall and  accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse effect on the company s operating results 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in volatility in the price of the shares of the company s common stock 
see business products and professional services and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
dependence on retail industry 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues to date from the license of software products and related services to the retail industry  and its future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry 
the success of the company s customers is intrinsically linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  the company believes the license of its products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital  because the company s products are often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or commitments 
as a result  although the company believes its products can assist retailers in a competitive environment  demand for the company s products and services could be disproportionately affected by instability or downturns in the retail industry which may cause customers to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for information management systems and software products 
the company also believes that the retail industry is experiencing a period of increased consolidation  which has in the past and may in the future affect the demand for the company s products 
recent results in the overall retail industry have been disappointing  and the company anticipates that existing or prospective customers may be experiencing or may in the future experience severe financial hardship 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue its revenue growth or sustain its profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that its results of operations will not be adversely affected by continuing or future downturns in the retail industry 
any resulting decline in demand for the company s products and services would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business industry background and company strategy and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth 
the growth in the size and complexity of the company s business and expansion of its product lines and its customer base have placed and are expected to continue to place a significant strain on the company s management and operations 
the company anticipates that continued growth  if any  will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new employees  including consulting and product development personnel  both domestically and abroad 
in particular  the company s ability to undertake new projects and increase license revenues is substantially dependent on the availability of the company s consulting personnel to assist in the licensing and implementation of the company s solutions 
the company will not be able to continue to increase its business at historical rates without adding significant numbers of trained consulting personnel 
accordingly  the company is currently attempting to significantly increase consulting capacity in anticipation of future revenues 
in their first year of employment by the company  new consulting personnel typically spend between two to ten weeks in training  during which period they do not generate revenues 
to the extent anticipated revenues fail to materialize following the hiring and training of new personnel  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel will be located  retained or trained in a timely manner 
in the event the company is unable to increase sufficiently its consulting capacity  the company may be required to forego licensing opportunities or become increasingly dependent on systems integrators and professional consulting firms to provide implementation services for its products 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  also will depend on its ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force 
accordingly  the company s future operating results will depend on the ability of its management and other key employees to continue to implement and improve its systems for operations  financial control and information management  to recruit  train and manage its employee base  in particular its direct sales force and consulting services organization  and to deal effectively with third party systems integrators and consultants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage or continue to manage its recent or any future growth  and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see business company strategy and industry background 
ability to attract and retain technical personnel 
the company is heavily dependent upon its ability to attract  retain and motivate skilled technical and managerial personnel  especially highly skilled engineers involved in ongoing product development and consulting personnel who assist in the license and implementation of the company s solutions 
in particular  the company s ability to install  maintain and enhance its enterprise products is substantially dependent upon its ability to locate  hire and train qualified software engineers 
the market for such individuals is intensely competitive  particularly in foreign markets 
in this regard the company  as part of its strategy  plans to significantly increase the number of consulting personnel in connection with the roll out of its odbms and win dss products and to support continued development and implementation of its mms product line 
given the critical role of the company s product development and consulting staffs  the inability to recruit successfully or the loss of a significant part of its product development or consulting staffs would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its current personnel  or that it will be able to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the inability to attract  hire or retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition

uncertain market for odbms win dss 
the company has recently released odbms and win dss 
both products are open  client server solutions 
the retail industry has only recently begun limited adoption of open  client server information systems 
the company believes that retailers in general may be relatively cautious in adopting new technologies 
in addition  many retailers do not have the personnel or staff required to implement  operate and maintain an open  client server system  and the difficulties associated with implementing new technology may slow or prevent adoption of the company s new products 
because the market for these products is new and evolving  it is difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the growth rate  if any  and size of this market 
there also can be no assurance that the market for odbms or win dss will develop  or that either of these products or related services will be adopted or utilized 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if the company s products do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the company is directing a significant amount of its product development expenditures to the ongoing development of odbms and win dss and a significant amount of its sales and marketing resources to the full commercial introduction of odbms and win dss 
a significant effort is still required to develop and release additional application modules for these products 
the company has limited experience in developing and marketing products for open system applications 
as a result  there can be no assurance that odbms and win dss will not require substantial software enhancements or modifications to satisfy performance requirements of customers or to fix design defects or previously undetected errors 
it is common for complex software programs such as odbms and win dss to contain undetected errors when first released  which are discovered only after the product has been used over time with different computer systems and in varying applications and environments 
while the company is not aware of any significant technical problems with these products  there can be no assurance that errors will not be discovered  or if discovered  that they will be successfully corrected on a timely basis  if at all 
the company s future business growth is substantially dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of odbms and win dss 
if customers experience significant problems with implementation of odbms and win dss or are otherwise dissatisfied with the functionality or performance of odbms or win dss  or if either of these products fails to achieve market acceptance for any reason  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
see business products and product development and jda technology 
product concentration 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from the license of a limited number of information management software applications for the retail industry and consulting and maintenance services related to such applications 
software licenses and related consulting  maintenance and other services revenues from the company s mms product line represented over of the company s revenues in each of and  and in the company expects that revenues related to this product will continue to account for a substantial but reduced percentage of total revenues as market acceptance of the company s newer products increases 
the life cycle of the mms product line is difficult to estimate due in large measure to the potential effect of new products  applications and product enhancements  including those introduced by the company  changes in the retail industry and future competition 
the company expects that revenues attributable to its mms and odbms enterprise products will comprise the substantial majority of software license revenues for the foreseeable future 
any decline in mms revenues  to the extent not offset by increases in revenues from other products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see business products and professional services and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
international operations 
in  and  international revenues  which include revenues from international subsidiaries and export sales  comprised approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future  and the company intends to continue expansion of its international infrastructure 
although the company maintains operations in the uk  singapore  canada  chile  mexico and germany  and is currently investing significant resources in its international operations  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in expanding its international operations 
the company anticipates that continued growth of its international operations will require the company to recruit and hire a number of new consulting  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries in which the company has established or will establish operations 
in addition  the company has only limited experience in developing localized versions of its products and in marketing and distributing its products internationally 
international rollout of the company s products requires significant investment by the company in advance of anticipated future revenues 
the opening of new offices by the company typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
in particular  successful introduction of the company s product into new markets requires the company to locate and hire qualified local sales and consulting personnel and train them in the operation of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the countries in which the company operates will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel for the company to hire from  or that the company will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully localize  market  sell and deliver its products internationally 
the inability of the company to successfully expand its international operations in a timely manner could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there are a number of other risks inherent in the company s international business activities  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  currency fluctuations  repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in addition  consulting  maintenance and other services in support of international licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to lower prevailing billing rates in certain of the company s international markets 
therefore  planned growth in the company s continued operations may result in further declines in gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services 
to the extent the company s international operations expand  the company expects that an increasing portion of its international license and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as the company continues to expand its international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
there can be no assurance that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues of the company earned in various countries where the company does business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  thereby adversely affecting the company s earnings

competition 
the market for retail information systems software is intensely competitive 
the company believes the principal competitive factors in such market are product quality  reliability  performance and price  vendor and product reputation  financial stability  features and functions  ease of use and quality of support 
a number of companies offer competitive products addressing certain of the company s target markets 
in the enterprise systems market  the company competes with in house systems developed by the company s targeted customers and with third party developers such as intrepid  island pacific  radius plc  retek a subsidiary of hnc software  inc  sts systems and richter management services  among others 
in addition  the company believes that new market entrants may attempt to develop fully integrated enterprise level systems targeting the retail industry 
in particular  sap aktiengesellschaft announced in august its intention to release an integrated client server enterprise system competitive with the company s products 
in january  intrepid announced the formation of a joint development and marketing relationship with  and a minority equity investment by  peoplesoft  a provider of enterprise applications software 
at that time  the parties projected the availability of products expected to compete directly with the company s odbms enterprise product in the second half of in the in store systems market  which is more fragmented than the enterprise market  the company competes with major systems manufacturers such as at t ncr  ibm and icl  as well as software companies such as applied intelligence group  crs business computers  inc  post software international  sts systems  gers retail systems and gateway data sciences corporation  among others 
in the market for consulting services  the company is pursuing a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems consulting groups such as andersen consulting  ernst young llp  price waterhouse s management horizons division and other similar major systems integrators 
however  these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as the issc division of ibm  also represent potential competition to the company s consulting services group 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against its current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see business competition 
technological change  market acceptance of evolving standards 
the computer software industry is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  the company s position in its existing market or other markets that it may enter could be eroded rapidly by technological advancements not embraced by the company 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the products must keep pace with technological developments  conform to evolving industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
in particular  the company believes that it must continue to respond quickly to users needs for broad functionality and multi platform support and to advances in hardware and operating systems 
introduction of new products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience future difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products  or that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company strives to achieve compatibility between the company s products and retailing systems platforms the company believes are or will become popular and widely adopted 
the company invests substantial resources in development efforts aimed at achieving such compatibility 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technology or market developments could result in a loss of competitiveness or revenue 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  business products  professional services and product development and jda technology 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees 
in particular  the services of james d 
armstrong  the company s chief executive officer  and frederick m 
pakis  the company s president  would be difficult to replace 
the company does not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of its employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary technology  including its software source code 
the company relies on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright law  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the company presently has no patents or patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties  including customers who receive listings of the source code for the company s products pursuant to the terms of their license agreements with the company  may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
as a result  there can be no assurance that unauthorized use of the company s technology may not occur 
certain technology used by the company s products is licensed from third parties  generally on a non exclusive basis 
the termination of any such licenses  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delay in the company s ability to ship certain of its products while it seeks to implement technology offered by alternative sources  and any required replacement licenses could prove costly

any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or force the company to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of such claims and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

despite extensive testing  the company from time to time has discovered defects or errors in its products or custom modifications only after its systems have been used by many customers 
the company has also experienced delays in shipment of products during the period required to correct such errors 
in addition  the company or its customers may from time to time experience difficulties relating to the integration of the company s products with other hardware or software in the customer s environment that are unrelated to defects in the company s products
