item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition general center banks incorporated the company is a bank holding company  with skaneateles savings bank the bank being its sole subsidiary 
the financial condition and operating results of the company are largely dependent on the bank  its primary investment 
on july   the bank acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed the deposit liabilities of cicero bank cicero 
total assets acquired were million  consisting of loans million  cash million and other assets million 
total deposit liabilities assumed were million  consisting of time accounts million  money market accounts million and savings and demand accounts million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired goodwill amounted to  and is included in other assets 
goodwill is being amortized over the expected useful life of seven years on a straight line basis 
total assets were million at december   compared with million at december   an increase of million or 
excluding assets acquired from cicero  total assets increased million or 
total assets millions loans net loans were million at december   an increase of million or from december  loan growth was million or excluding loans acquired from cicero 
loan originations for totaled million  an increase of from s originations of million 
residential mortgage originations were million in  an increase of from s originations 
this represented of s total loan originations  down from in approximately million or of the residential loans originated in were for fixed rates of interest  compared with million and  respectively  in fixed rate mortgages with terms of years or less are originated for portfolio as long as they fit the bank s established asset liability mix  while fixed rate mortgages with terms greater than years are sold on the secondary market to control the bank s interest rate risk 
during the bank sold approximately million of fixed rate residential loans  compared with million in the bank retains servicing on all sold loans 
in addition to fixed rate loans  the bank offers adjustable rate loans with rates that adjust annually year arm  or once every three years year arm 
originations of year and year arm s totaled million or of residential mortgage originations in  compared with million or in the bank also offers a arm 
the arm is a loan with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years 
on the loan s fifth anniversary  the rate converts to the current rate for a year arm  and adjusts annually over the remaining term of the loan 
originations of arm s totaled million or of residential loan originations in  compared with million or in adjustable rate loans are generally retained for portfolio 
a large portion of the residential mortgages originated in and was referred to the bank by third party brokers in areas contiguous to the bank s designated lending area 
brokers were used to supplement the bank s own direct originations in order to meet mortgage lending goals 
increasing competition in mortgage lending  however  has squeezed margins and profitability 
as a result  the bank has shifted its lending focus  placing more emphasis on consumer and commercial loans 
in the third quarter of  the bank effectively suspended the use of mortgage brokers  focusing instead on its designated lending area for residential mortgages 
it is expected that future mortgage production will decrease as a result 
total loans millions consumer loan originations were million or of total loan originations in  compared with million or in although the relative level of originations is down from last year due to stronger growth in the other loan categories  the actual origination volume of consumer loans increased  due primarily to a larger branch network and more focused marketing efforts 
the bank opened two new in supermarket branches in the second quarter of and added another branch from cicero in these three new branches contributed significantly to consumer loan production in  accounting for approximately of total originations 
the bank s marketing strategy changed in from general media advertising to targeted mailings to current and potential customers promoting specific products 
in january  a marketing software package was purchased which allows the bank to identify all relationships with its customers on an individual or household level 
this software is expected to further enhance the effectiveness of the direct mail marketing program 
to further increase consumer loan production  the bank implemented an indirect lending program in the third quarter of  through which it receives consumer loan applications from bank approved automobile and recreational vehicle dealerships on behalf of their customers to finance their purchases 
this program is expected to be an integral part of the bank s consumer loan origination efforts in and beyond 
these applications are subject to the bank s normal consumer loan underwriting criteria 
commercial loan and mortgage originations were million or of total loan originations in  up from or in compared with  total new commercial loan and mortgage volume increased 
the increase resulted largely from a strengthening of the bank s business development activities  including an active calling program  a new indirect leasing program and a greater presence by the bank in local trade and business shows 
other assets other assets were million at december   down from december  the balance at december  included million which was reclassified from cash and due from banks  representing balances owed the bank by nationar  which was in liquidation 
during  the bank received of the amount owed 
on july  the bank recorded an intangible asset of  representing goodwill relating to the cicero transaction 
deposits deposit growth was the primary source of funds for the bank in total deposits  including escrow  were million at december   an increase of million or from the end of excluding deposits assumed from cicero  deposits increased million or in the bank changed its strategy for deposit growth in  placing more emphasis on savings and checking accounts  which carry lower rates of interest than time accounts and tend to be less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in february  the bank developed seven new checking account products  each targeted to specific demographic groups and supported by an active direct mail marketing campaign 
as a result  the bank s total checking account balances increased million or in  while its savings account balances were up million or 
both gains were exclusive of accounts assumed from cicero 
more than  new checking accounts were opened in as a result of this program  representing a increase in the number of accounts compared with the end of the direct mail marketing program will be a key part of the bank s deposit growth strategy for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the lower interest cost of these deposits  the accounts generate fee income which will provide a stable source of revenue regardless of fluctuations in interest rates 
also  the increase in checking account customers provides a significant opportunity to cross sell other deposit and loan products 
total deposits millions asset quality nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned 
management s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status with respect to interest income recognition when collection of the interest is doubtful 
generally  this occurs when principal or interest payments are ninety days or more past due  although interest accruals may continue for certain loans that are adequately secured 
the classification of a loan as nonaccruing does not necessarily indicate that the principal and interest ultimately will be uncollectable 
the bank s historical experience suggests that a portion of assets so classified will eventually be recovered 
all nonperforming loans are in various stages of workout  settlement or foreclosure 
nonperforming assets totaled million  or of total assets at december   compared with million  or of total assets at december  included in nonperforming assets at december  were nonaccrual loans of million or of gross loans  compared with million or at december  nonaccrual loans acquired in the cicero transaction accounted for approximately of the increase in excluding the loans acquired form cicero  the bank s nonperforming loans would have been million or of gross loans at december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december  compared with million at december  the bank absorbed cicero s allowance for loan losses of  on july   which equaled of cicero s nonperforming loans at the acquisition date 
the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was at december   compared with at the end of loan loss provisions totaled  in  compared with  in charge offs  net of recoveries  amounted to million in  compared with  in the increase is attributable to the bank charging off  on one commercial loan 
this loan was originated in and has been a collection problem for a number of years 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly  and is determined primarily by management s informed judgment concerning the amount of risk inherent in the portfolio 
management s judgment is based upon a number of factors including historical loan loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  estimated value of underlying collateral  industry and geographic concentrations  and current and prospective economic conditions 
the bank utilizes a risk rating system in its credit quality estimation process 
this system involves an ongoing review of business loans and commercial real estate loans that culminates in loans being assigned a risk rating based upon various credit criteria 
if the review indicates a sufficient level of risk  an allowance is established proportionate to the perceived risk for each loan 
loans not having an individually established allowance are aggregated by the type of loan and an allowance is estimated based upon aging statistics  past experience and economic factors 
generally  all commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans in a delinquent payment status days or more delinquent are considered impaired 
the bank estimates losses on impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
an impairment loss exists if the recorded investment in a loan exceeds the value of the loan as measured by the aforementioned methods 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  home equity lines of credit and education loans are evaluated collectively since they are homogenous and generally carry smaller individual balances 
as with any financial institution  poor economic conditions  high interest rates  high unemployment and other matters outside of the bank s control may lead to increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management has various controls in place designed in an effort to limit losses  such as a comprehensive watch list of possible loan problems  a fully documented policy concerning loan administration loan file documentation  disclosures  approvals  etc 
and a loan review department to audit for adherence to established bank controls and to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
the loan review department reports monthly to the executive committee of the board of directors  which in turn  reports to the full board of directors 
the power to authorize charge offs rests solely with the board of directors 
management believes the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate based upon the quality of the loan portfolio at that date 
future additions to the allowance will be based  among other factors  on changes in economic conditions and financial stress of the company s borrowers 
asset liability management the goal of asset liability management is to reduce the volatility of net interest income during periods of changing market interest rates interest rate risk 
the company uses three methods to measure its interest rate risk i gap  ii duration  and iii simulation analysis 
gap analysis measures the difference between assets and liabilities which reprice and or mature within a given time frame  typically the cumulative one year horizon 
an asset sensitive gap position could lead to an increase in net interest income in a rising rate environment  and a decrease in net interest income in a falling rate environment  as assets reprice or mature quicker than liabilities 
conversely  a liability sensitive gap position could lead to a decrease in net interest income in a rising rate environment and an increase in net interest income in a falling rate environment 
duration analysis measures the weighted average time to receive pay all cash flows principal and interest on a financial instrument 
the shorter the duration of a financial instrument  the quicker its cash flows are received paid 
simulation analysis measures the impact on net interest income and market value of equity of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
through simulation analysis  management can also estimate the impact on net interest income of different investing and funding strategies 
in february  the bank purchased an interest rate floor with a notional amount of million  to hedge a portion of its prime based loan portfolio 
under the agreement  which expires in february  the bank will receive payments on a quarterly basis if the prime rate drops below the strike rate 
payments are equal to the amount by which the prime rate falls below the strike rate multiplied by the notional amount of the floor 
the fee paid for the floor is included in other assets and is being amortized to interest income using the interest method over the life of the floor 
the company s cumulative year ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities year gap was 
at december  the duration of interest bearing assets and liabilities was years and years  respectively 
these measurements indicate a slightly liability sensitive position 
stockholder s equity at december   the company s stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  this increase is the result of i net income of million  ii proceeds of  from issuance of stock under stock plans  iii cash dividends of  and iv a  decrease in the fair value of securities  net of taxes 
the company s and bank s leverage capital ratio was at december  compared with at december  total capital to risk adjusted assets was and  respectively  at december  and the drop in the capital ratios resulted from the company s rate of asset growth exceeding that of equity 
both capital measurements exceed the regulatory requirements of and  respectively  to be classified as a well capitalized institution 
liquidity and capital resources the purpose of liquidity management is to assure sufficient cash flow to meet all of the company s financial requirements and to be able to capitalize on opportunities for increasing income 
liquidity is mainly provided by cash  securities available for sale  principal and interest collections on loans and mortgage backed securities deposits and borrowing facilities from correspondent banks 
the bank has overnight line of credit facilities with the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb totaling million which can be used to meet the bank s daily cash needs 
in addition  the bank can borrow additional amounts on a term basis from the fhlb 
the company s liquidity position is monitored daily  and the asset liability committee is responsible for setting general guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
at the end of  the bank s approved commitments to extend credit amounted to million 
further information on commitments is in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s liquidity is considered adequate to meet all of its cash flow requirements 
net income thousands   results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  general the company s and bank s earnings are largely dependent upon net interest income  and are also affected by its provision for loan losses  other operating income and expenses  and taxes 
net income was  or per share in  compared with  or per share in a  increase in net interest income and a  increase in other operating income was partially offset by a million increase in other expenses 
income taxes decreased  net interest income net interest income is affected by the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relative amounts of interest earning assets  deposits  and borrowings also impact net interest income levels 
net interest income was million in  an increase of  or from interest income increased million or in due to a million increase in average interest earning assets  partially offset by a 
decrease in the yield on those assets 
loans acquired from cicero  consisting primarily of consumer and commercial loans  accounted for approximately million of the increase in average balances 
the rest of the increase in average interest earning assets resulted from new loan originations during the year 
asset yields are generally down in due to a slightly lower interest rate environment compared with  as well as to competitive pressures in the bank s local lending area 
yields on other loans are heavily influenced by home equity lines of credit and commercial loans which generally carry a variable rate of interest tied to the bank s prime rate 
the rate on commercial loans adjusts whenever the prime rate changes 
home equity adjustments take effect between and days after a change in the prime rate 
the bank s prime rate  which is directly impacted by movements in short term rates by the federal reserve  averaged in  compared with in net interest margin analysis of net interest income the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding i the total dollar amount of interest income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  ii the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average cost  iii net interest income  iv interest rate spread  v net interest earning assets  vi net yield on interest earning assets  and vii ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities

deposits assumed from cicero bank accounted for approximately million of the increase in average interest bearing deposits 
of this amount  approximately million were time accounts 
the bank s deposit mix changed in as a function of the bank s strategy to emphasize and promote savings and checking accounts 
while time deposits as a percentage of total deposits including escrow increased from in to in  they dropped to of total deposits in the corresponding increase in lower costing transaction accounts savings  demand and now accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of funds  along with the effects of a slightly lower interest rate environment in market interest rates alone do not dictate the rates the company pays for its funds  although they are an important factor 
other factors that impact the company s cost of funds include liquidity needs  the desired mix of deposits and borrowings  local market competition and asset growth objectives

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements presented in the annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
measurement of financial position and operating results have been made in terms of historical dollars 
changes in the relative purchasing power of money due to inflation are not reflected 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  thus banks are more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily reflect the direction or magnitude of changes in the price of goods and services which are primarily affected by inflation 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are of major importance in maintaining acceptable levels of performance 
recently issued accounting standards the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights  as of january  on a prospective basis 
sfas no 
requires the company to recognize as separate assets rights to service mortgage loans for others  however those servicing rights are acquired  and also requires that capitalized mortgage servicing rights be assessed for impairment based on the fair value of those rights 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations because its level of sales of mortgages where servicing is retained is not significant 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation by electing to continue accounting for stock options under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
and provide pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after december   and is based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
the statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
in december  fasb deferred for one year the effective date of sfas no 
as it relates to transfers of financial assets and secured borrowings and collateral 
management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations
