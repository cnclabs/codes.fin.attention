item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company s sales and operating revenues increased in compared to a increase in the increase in sales and operating revenues was primarily due to a increase in the average unit selling price of petroleum products and a million or increase in merchandise sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in petroleum product sales volumes principally attributable to the processing contract with statoil wherein the company processed  barrels per day for statoil during the last five months of the increase in sales and operating revenues was due to a increase in the average unit selling price of petroleum products and a increase in petroleum product sales volumes 
additionally  there was a million or increase in merchandise sales 
as previously mentioned  merchandise sales increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  while merchandise gross profit increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in merchandise gross margin merchandise gross profit as a percent of merchandise sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these aggregate increases occurred despite a slight reduction in the number of operating units during the period  and are attributable to the company s merchandise pricing program which has selectively increased margins on targeted merchandise yet still maintains an everyday low pricing policy which is competitive with major retail providers in the applicable market area 
as a result of the strategy  aggregate merchandise gross profit  on a same store basis  increased in as compared to same store average monthly gasoline volumes and merchandise sales increased approximately and  respectively  in as compared to gasoline sales accounted for of total revenues  while distillates and merchandise sales represented and  respectively 
this compares to a dollar mix from sales of gasoline  distillates and merchandise in  and gasoline  distillates and merchandise in the following table depicts the sales values of the principal classes of products sold by the company  which individually contributed more than ten percent of consolidated sales and operating revenues during the last three years sales of principal products millions of dollars gasoline no 
fuel diesel costs and operating expenses increased in compared to a increase in the increase was attributable to an increase in the average production cost per barrel of crude oil and feedstocks of 
this increase was partially offset by slight decreases in petroleum products sales volumes as mentioned above 
additional decreases offsetting the increase in average production per barrel mentioned above result from the company s use of the last in  first out lifo method to value inventory which results in a better matching of current revenues and costs 
the impact of lifo was to increase the company s costs and operating expenses by approximately 
million and million in and  respectively 
the increase was attributable to an increase in the average production cost per barrel of crude oil and feedstocks of or and to a increase in petroleum products sales volumes 
the impact of the company s use of the lifo method was to decrease the company s gross margins in  and by 
per barrel 
million  
per barrel million and 
per barrel million  respectively 
the lifo impact is net of gross margin increases of million resulting from a change in base year values for a portion of the company s lifo inventories and reductions in lifo inventories of million  which were carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years 
the lifo impact is net of a million gross margin increase resulting from a reduction in lifo inventories 
in early  the company adjusted its gasoline and distillate production to take advantage of better distillate margins compared to gasoline margins 
correspondingly  yields of distillates were increased to  barrels per day bpd in from  bpd in  while gasoline production was decreased from  bpd in to  bpd in due to deteriorating refinery gross margins which occurred during the third quarter of  the company reduced fourth quarter operating runs at its pasadena refinery 
additionally  in  overall refinery production was reduced by the fourth quarter s maintenance turnaround of the pasadena refinery s fluid catalytic cracking unit fccu and related units 
the fccu is the primary gasoline facility 
as a result  yields of gasoline increased from  bpd in to  bpd in distillate yields decreased slightly from  bpd in to  bpd in total refinery production was  bpd in   bpd in and  bpd in selling and administrative expenses increased in after decreasing in the increase was primarily due to increases in store level operating expenses principally related to additional retail outlets acquired in the third quarter of which operated for a full year in and to a same price cash or credit gasoline marketing strategy that increased credit card processing fees 
also included in were increased labor costs resulting from the installation of branded fast food operations in certain retail outlets 
additionally the company recorded approximately million in corporate administrative expenses associated with a management reorganization  
million associated with certain long range strategic initiatives and million in employee incentive payments due to improved company performance 
the decrease was primarily due to decreased corporate level administrative costs as a result of certain cost cutting programs initiated by the company 
at december   the company operated retail gasoline facilities and convenience stores compared to retail gasoline facilities and convenience stores at december  and retail gasoline facilities and convenience stores at december  selling and administrative expenses in include 
million in reorganization costs 
operating costs and expenses in  and include million  million and million  respectively  related to environmental matters and 
million  
million and million  respectively  of accrued non environmental casualty related costs 
operating costs and expenses in have been reduced by million relating to adjustments in certain liability reserves 
additionally  and expenses also include million and million  respectively  related to retail units that have been closed 
depreciation and amortization decreased in after decreasing in the decreases were primarily the result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  effective october   which decreased depreciation and amortization by approximately million 
the decreases were primarily the result of decreases in refinery turnaround amortization due to a million decrease in the total underlying value of the pasadena refinery fccu turnaround being amortized in compared to the total underlying value of the fccu turnaround that was being amortized in the loss from write down of property  plant and equipment of million in is due to the initial adoption of sfas effective october  while all of the company s long lived assets are subject to the provisions of sfas  circumstances indicated the carrying amount of assets used in the operation of the tyler refinery would not be recoverable 
as such  a write down to estimated fair value was recorded 
the estimated fair value of these assets was determined by an independent appraisal 
there were no indications of possible impairment relating to the remainder of the company s long lived assets 
the loss of million from write downs of property  plant and equipment in resulted from the abandonment of a project to construct a hydrodesulphurization unit at the pasadena refinery 
interest and other income in decreased million after increasing million in the decrease is due primarily to the consolidation in the fourth quarter of of the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiaries which reported million in equity earnings and recorded as other income in the income of the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiaries of approximately 
million is reported as part of the company s consolidated gross margin 
additionally  interest income decreased million due to a decrease in the average daily cash invested of million 
the increase was primarily the result of increases in other income of million from the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiaries 
further  interest income increased million due to an increase in the average daily cash invested of million and to an increase in the average daily rate on cash invested of basis points 
interest expense in was comparable to interest expense increased million in compared to due primarily to an increase in the average daily cash borrowed of million 
at december   there were additional outstanding borrowings of million compared to december  the additional outstanding borrowings were due to the sale of million of unsecured senior notes in january net of the repayment of the outstanding balance of the unsecured senior notes and unsecured credit agreement outstanding on december  as previously discussed  in january  the company retired the remaining outstanding principal balance of the unsecured senior notes including a prepayment premium of million with the proceeds from the sale of million of unsecured senior notes due february  which resulted in a net extraordinary loss in the first quarter of of million after reduction for the income benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents were million lower at year end than at year end the decrease was attributable to million of net cash outflows from investment activities and million of net cash outflows from financing activities 
these outflows were principally offset by cash provided by operating activities of million 
net cash outflows from investment activities in consisted principally of capital expenditures of million which includes million related to the marketing area and million for refinery operations and million in capitalized costs of software and related business processes developed for the company s own use 
additionally  cash outflows from investing activities include million of refinery deferred turnaround costs 
the total outflows from investment activities were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash outflows from financing activities in relates primarily to net repayments of long term debt of million 
net cash inflows from operating activities in is net of million in net outflows relating to other assets and liabilities 
these outflows were primarily the result of decreases in accrued income and excise tax liabilities and in other accounts payable and to increases in prepaid insurance premiums and in accounts receivable 
partially offsetting these cash outflows were decreases in crude oil and finished products inventories due primarily to a reduction in crude oil requirements at the pasadena refinery  and decreases in recoverable and deferred income taxes 
the timing of collection of the company s receivables is impacted by the specific type of sale and associated terms 
bulk sales of finished products are typically sold in  barrel increments with three day payment terms 
rack sales at the company s product terminals are sold by truckload approximately  gallons with seven to ten day payment terms 
while the company s overall sales are aligned to its refining capability  receivables can vary between periods depending upon the specific type of sale and associated payment terms for sales near the end of a reporting period the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and to  respectively  at december  and if fifo values had been used for all inventories  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities would have been at december  and at december  like other petroleum refiners and marketers  the company s operations are subject to extensive and rapidly changing federal and state environmental regulations governing air emissions  waste water discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
the company s policy is to accrue environmental and clean up related costs of a non capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often extremely difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  the company anticipates that a significant capital investment will be required over the next several years to comply with existing regulations 
the company believes that cash provided from its operating activities  together with other available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund these costs 
the company had recorded a liability of approximately million as of december  to cover the estimated costs of compliance with environmental regulations which are not anticipated to be of a capital nature 
the liability of million includes accruals for issues extending past environmental liabilities are subject to considerable uncertainties which affect the company s ability to estimate its ultimate cost of remediation efforts 
these uncertainties include the exact nature and extent of the contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts  varying costs of alternative remediation strategies  changes in environmental remediation requirements  the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the identification of new environmental sites 
as a result  charges to income for environmental liabilities could have a material effect on results of operations in a particular quarter or year as assessments and remediation efforts proceed or as new claims arise 
however  management is not aware of any matters which would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
during the years  the company estimates environmental expenditures at the pasadena and tyler refineries  of at least million and million  respectively 
of these expenditures  it is anticipated that million for pasadena and million for tyler will be of a capital nature  while million and 
million  respectively  will be related to previously accrued non capital remediation efforts 
at the company s marketing facilities  environmental expenditures relating to previously accrued non capital compliance efforts are planned totaling approximately million through as a result of a strong balance sheet and overall favorable credit relationships  the company has been able to maintain open lines of credit with its major suppliers 
under the revolving credit agreement effective september   as amended credit agreement  the company had outstanding as of march   irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million for purposes in the ordinary course of business 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants and provisions of the credit agreement 
meeting the covenants imposed by the credit agreement is dependent  among other things  upon the level of future earnings 
the company reasonably expects to continue to be in compliance with the covenants imposed by the credit agreement or a successor agreement over the next twelve months 
at the company s option  up to million of the unsecured senior notes notes may be redeemed at of the principal amount at any time prior to february  after such date  they may not be redeemed until february  when they are redeemable at of the principal amount  and thereafter at an annually declining premium over par until february  when they are redeemable at par 
the notes were issued under an indenture which includes certain restrictions and limitations customary with senior indebtedness of this type including  but not limited to  the payment of dividends and the repurchase of capital stock 
there are no sinking fund requirements on the notes 
the purchase money lien money lien discussed in note c of notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report  is secured by certain service station and terminal equipment and office furnishings having a cost basis of million 
the effective rate for the money lien is 
ninety percent of the principal is payable in equal monthly installments which commenced in february with a balloon payment of of the principal payable in january the company s management is involved in a continual process of evaluating growth opportunities in its core business as well as its capital resource alternatives 
total capital expenditures and deferred turnaround costs in are projected to approximate million 
the capital expenditures relate primarily to planned enhancements at the company s refineries  retail unit improvements and to company wide environmental requirements 
the company believes that cash provided from its operating activities  together with other available sources of liquidity  including the unsecured credit agreement or a successor agreement  will be sufficient over the next several years to make required payments of principal and interest on its debt  permit anticipated capital expenditures and fund the company s working capital requirements 
the unsecured credit agreement expires on september  and the company intends to renew or replace the existing facility 
any major acquisition would likely require a combination of additional debt and equity 
the company places its temporary cash investments in high credit quality financial instruments which are in accordance with the covenants of the company s financing agreements 
these securities mature within ninety days  and  therefore  bear minimal risk 
the company has not experienced any losses on its investments 
the company faces intense competition in all of the business areas in which it operates 
many of the company s competitors are substantially larger and therefore  the company s earnings can be affected by the marketing and pricing policies of its competitors  as well as changes in raw material costs 
merchandise sales and operating revenues from the company s convenience stores are seasonal in nature  generally producing higher sales and net income in the summer months than at other times of the year 
gasoline sales  both at the crown multi pumps and convenience stores  are also somewhat seasonal in nature and  therefore  related revenues may vary during the year 
the seasonality does not  however  negatively impact the company s overall ability to sell its refined products 
the company maintains business interruption insurance to protect itself against losses resulting from shutdowns to refinery operations from fire  explosions and certain other insured casualties 
business interruption coverage begins for such losses at the greater of million or shutdowns for periods in excess of days 
the company has disclosed in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report  various contingencies which involve litigation  environmental liabilities and examinations by the internal revenue service 
depending on the occurrence  amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these contingencies  the outcome of which cannot reasonably be determined at this time  it is possible that the company s future results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected in a particular quarter or year 
however  the company has concluded  after consultation with counsel  that there is no reasonable basis to believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these contingencies will have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  as discussed in item legal proceedings on page of this report  the company s collective bargaining agreement at its pasadena refinery expired on february   and on february   the company invoked a lock out of employees in the collective bargaining unit 
the company has been operating the pasadena refinery without interruption since the lock out with management and supervisory personnel and intends to continue full operations until an agreement is reached with the collective bargaining unit 
effects of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the dollar s purchasing power 
in the capital intensive industry in which the company operates  the replacement costs for its properties would generally far exceed their historical costs 
as a result  depreciation would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  since the replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive and versatile than existing facilities  thereby increasing profits and mitigating increased depreciation and operating costs 
in recent years  crude oil and refined petroleum product prices have been volatile which has impacted working capital requirements 
if the prices increase in the future  the company would expect a related increase in working capital needs 
additional factors that may affect future results the company s operating results have been  and will continue to be  affected by a wide variety of factors that could have an adverse effect on profitability during any particular period  many of which are beyond the company s control 
among these are the demand for crude oil and refined products  which is largely driven by the condition of local and worldwide economies  although seasonality and weather patterns also play a significant part 
governmental regulations and policies  particularly in the areas of energy and the environment  also have a significant impact on the company s activities 
operating results can be affected by these industry factors  by competition in the particular geographic markets that the company serves and by company specific factors  such as the success of particular marketing programs and refinery operations 
in addition  the company s profitability depends largely on the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil prices 
this margin is continually changing and may significantly fluctuate from time to time 
crude oil and refined products are commodities whose price levels are determined by market forces beyond the control of the company 
additionally  due to the seasonality of refined products and refinery maintenance schedules  results of operations for any particular quarter of a fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year 
in general  prices for refined products are significantly influenced by the price of crude oil 
although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil generally results in a corresponding increase or decrease in prices for refined products  often there is a lag time in the realization of the corresponding increase or decrease in prices for refined products 
the effect of changes in crude oil prices on operating results therefore depends in part on how quickly refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes 
a substantial or prolonged increase in crude oil prices without a corresponding increase in refined product prices  a substantial or prolonged decrease in refined product prices without a corresponding decrease in crude oil prices  or a substantial or prolonged decrease in demand for refined products could have a significant negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company is dependent on refining and selling quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover operating costs  including any future inflationary pressures 
the refining business is characterized by high fixed costs resulting from the significant capital outlays associated with refineries  terminals and related facilities 
furthermore  future regulatory requirements or competitive pressures could result in additional capital expenditures  which may or may not produce desired results 
such capital expenditures may require significant financial resources that may be contingent on the company s continued access to capital markets and commercial bank financing on favorable terms 
purchases of crude oil supply are typically made pursuant to relatively short term  renewable contracts with numerous foreign and domestic major and independent oil producers  generally containing market responsive pricing provisions 
futures  forwards and exchange traded options are used to minimize the exposure of the company s refining margins to crude oil and refined product fluctuations 
the company also uses the futures market to help manage the price risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in advance of the delivery date  and in maintaining the inventories contained within its refinery and pipeline system 
hedging strategies used to minimize this exposure include fixing a future margin between crude and certain finished products and also hedging fixed price purchase and sales commitments of crude oil and refined products 
while the company s hedging activities are intended to reduce volatility while providing an acceptable profit margin on a portion of production  the use of such a program can effect the company s ability to participate in an improvement in related product profit margins 
although the company s net sales and operating revenues fluctuate significantly with movements in industry crude oil prices  such prices do not have a direct relationship to net earnings  which are subject to the impact of the company s lifo method of accounting discussed below 
the effect of changes in crude oil prices on the company s operating results is determined more by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect such changes 
the following table estimates the sensitivity of the company s income before taxes to price changes which impact its refining and retail margins based on a representative production rate for the refineries and a representative amount of total gasoline sold at the company s retail units earnings sensitivity change annual impact refining margin bbl million retail margin gal million the company conducts environmental assessments and remediation efforts at multiple locations  including operating facilities and previously owned or operated facilities 
the company accrues environmental and clean up related costs of a non capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
estimated costs  which are based upon experience and assessments  are recorded at undiscounted amounts without considering the impact of inflation  and are adjusted periodically as additional or new information is available 
expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized 
the company s crude oil  refined products and convenience store merchandise and gasoline inventories are valued at the lower of cost based on the last in  first out or lifo method of accounting or market  with the exception of crude oil inventory held for resale which is valued at the lower of cost based on the first in first out or fifo method of accounting or market 
under the lifo method  the effects of price increases and decreases in crude oil and other feedstocks are charged directly to the cost of refined products sold in the period that such price changes occur 
in periods of rising prices  the lifo method may cause reported operating income to be lower than would otherwise result from the use of the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling prices the lifo method may cause reported operating income to be higher than would otherwise result from the use of the fifo method 
in addition  the company s use of the lifo method understates the value of inventories on the company s consolidated balance sheet as compared to the value of inventories under the fifo method
