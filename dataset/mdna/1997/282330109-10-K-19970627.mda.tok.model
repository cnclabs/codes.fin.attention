item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general egghead is a national reseller of pc hardware  software  peripherals and accessories through retail stores  its egghead direct response unit and its internet commerce site 
egghead began operations in primarily as a software reseller  but in recent years has expanded its product offerings to include a greater percentage of hardware and other non software products 
egghead s profitability over its early operating history was mixed  however  over its last five fiscal years  egghead has reported increasing losses from continuing operations 
egghead s losses over the last five fiscal years are attributable primarily to an increased number of competitors selling pc products through a greater variety of channels  severe price competition among pc product resellers  a trend toward lower margins on computer and related software products  egghead s relatively high headquarters expenses and other factors described in more detail under risk factors 
egghead has taken a number of steps intended to reduce or eliminate egghead s losses and to achieve break even operating results on a cash flow basis for fiscal these steps include divesting a non retail business segment  focusing its retail operations in certain geographic markets  closing unprofitable stores  upgrading existing stores  experimenting with new store formats  developing electronic commerce tools through its elekom subsidiary and implementing a new internet commerce site 
for example  in may  egghead sold its cge division to generate cash and to allow management to focus on retail operations 
the sale resulted in a net gain of million  offset by a related loss from the cge operations of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  egghead substantially restructured and reorganized its operations by i closing of its worst performing retail stores  ii substantially reducing its headquarters personnel  iii closing its lancaster  pennsylvania distribution center  and iv offering for sale certain real estate assets  including its administrative headquarters building located in liberty lake  washington 
egghead intends to close an additional seven poorly performing retail stores as part of the restructuring and reorganization 
the restructuring and reorganization concentrated egghead s retail stores into geographic markets and is expected to reduce headquarters and distribution expenses for continuing operations to approximately million on an annualized basis from million in fiscal since fiscal  egghead has also opened or remodeled eight  square foot stores  which are approximately twice the size of its traditional stores  and increased its hardware product offerings in these stores in an effort to improve sales 
egghead currently operates of these larger format stores  of which were existing stores that have been open for more than one year and were expanded  remodeled or relocated 
in fiscal  egghead generated comparable store sales and operating profit increases of and  respectively  from these stores 
in november  egghead opened one egghead computer surplus store  operated as a joint venture with surplus direct  to participate in a new retail channel for surplus pc products 
these initiatives have achieved mixed results 
although the restructuring and reorganization will reduce headquarters and distribution expenses  further reductions in operating expenses may be necessary 
closure of poorly performing stores should improve retail store operating performance and inventory turn ratios for the remaining stores  but results from its new larger stores have been mixed 
egghead will continue to evaluate the performance of its larger format stores and expects that further refinement of its store format will be required 
there can be no assurance that egghead will be able to maintain the improved results it has achieved in its upgraded stores or replicate them in other stores 
egghead s internet commerce site  which was activated in february  did not generate significant amounts of revenue and there can be no assurance that this distribution method will generate significant revenue in the future 
although elekom is currently testing prototypes of its products  egghead s investment in elekom has not resulted in any revenue to date  and there can be no assurance that it will generate revenues in future periods 
accordingly  it is not yet clear that egghead has developed a business strategy that will accomplish the goal of further reducing and eliminating its losses  and there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
if egghead cannot develop a profitable strategy  and its losses continue  egghead will deplete its financial resources and reduce shareholders equity 
on may   egghead announced a definitive agreement the merger agreement to acquire closely held surplus direct for up to million newly issued shares of egghead common stock 
the transaction includes repayment of million of surplus direct debt 
surplus direct  a reseller of previous version computer hardware and software  had sales for the nine months ended february  of approximately million 
surplus direct has a relatively limited operating history  and  although it reported break even to profitable results for the three fiscal years ended may   and  it reported a million loss for the nine months ended february  egghead believes that the merger will create synergies through the combination of surplus direct s hardware purchasing expertise  access to the surplus pc products channel  entrepreneurial management and internet commerce development capabilities with egghead s greater software product procurement expertise and seasoned retail management 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that these benefits will be achieved 
the transaction is subject to approval by egghead s and surplus direct s shareholders and customary closing conditions  and is expected to be completed in august in connection with the signing of the merger agreement  egghead and surplus direct entered into a bridge loan agreement  dated april   pursuant to which egghead loaned surplus direct million to finance its working capital needs pending completion of the merger the bridge loan 
the bridge loan bears interest at the prime rate as quoted by seattle first national bank plus per annum and is due on december  in the event that the merger does not occur 
the bridge loan is subordinated to up to million of senior indebtedness the bank debt of surplus direct under a credit facility with its principal bank the bank and ranks pari passu with million of surplus direct debt under a subordinated note the sv capital note payable to sv capital partners  lp  which is a substantial shareholder of surplus direct sv capital partners 
the bridge loan and the sv capital note are secured by a second lien behind the bank debt on the principal assets of surplus direct 
egghead has agreed to repay the bank debt and the sv capital note at the closing and the bank and sv capital partners have agreed not to accelerate their loans prior to the closing of the merger  except under specified circumstances 
egghead uses a week fiscal year  ending on the saturday nearest march of each year 
each fiscal quarter consists of weeks 
information contained in this report excludes  unless otherwise stated  any data relative to the discontinued operations of the cge division 
results of operations overview egghead reported a total net loss for fiscal of million compared to a total net loss of million for fiscal and net income of million for fiscal on a pre tax basis  the loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million million excluding restructuring and impairment charges compared to losses of million for fiscal and million for fiscal in addition to the restructuring and impairment charges  the total net loss for fiscal included a net noncash charge of million for the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance and a million gain on the sale of the cge division  partially offset by the related loss from discontinued operations of million 
the restructuring and impairment charges totaled million before income taxes and were recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal the charges included million in gross margin expenses  million for settlement of store and warehouse leases  million for fixed asset dispositions  professional fees and miscellaneous expenses  million in store closing costs and related fixed asset dispositions  million for the impairment and disposition of real estate and million for severance and related benefits 
the pretax loss during fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in sales compared to fiscal resulting from a reduction in the average number of stores in full operation during the year  as well as one time costs of approximately million associated with the relocation of egghead s corporate headquarters  costs of rolling out its larger format retail stores  and its investment of approximately million in elekom 
fiscal year pretax income was primarily attributable to increases from fiscal in hardware and accessory sales and included a one time theft insurance recovery of million  pretax  related to inventory stolen from retail stores in prior years 
given its recent losses  egghead determined that its deferred tax assets no longer met the realization criteria of sfas no 
sfas 
under sfas  the realization of the deferred tax assets depends on generating future taxable income 
egghead management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets could not currently be realized 
accordingly  egghead recorded a net noncash charge in fiscal of million for the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance in accordance with sfas egghead s net operating losses can be recovered over a year period for tax purposes if egghead achieves profitability 
until egghead has determined that all of its existing net operating losses are realizable  it will not record a tax charge or benefit for future operating results 
for comparative purposes egghead s results of operations are discussed below on a pretax basis 
continuing operations pretax loss 
loss before income taxes includes the results of egghead s retail stores  egghead direct response unit  internet commerce operations and elekom  as well as the selling  general and administrative expenses related to these operations

net sales 
sales through egghead s retail stores constitute the principal component of egghead s net sales 
although egghead commenced sales of pc products through the internet in february  internet commerce sales did not represent a significant percentage of net sales in fiscal sales through egghead s retail stores are primarily related to the number of such stores in operation during the fiscal period  the size of those stores  the number of new retail stores and the performance of comparable retail stores during the period 
net sales are also affected by new pc product releases  competition from other resellers and a variety of other factors 
as is the case with many retailers  a significant portion of egghead s sales are generated in the fiscal quarter that includes the winter holiday selling season 
as a result  egghead s fiscal year results will be heavily dependent on the results for that quarter 
see business of egghead certain risk factors fluctuations in  and uncertainty of  future operating results  future losses and competition 
during fiscal  egghead opened seven stores  remodeled two stores and closed stores  operating a total of stores at march   including egghead computer surplus 
this compares to the stores open at fiscal year end and the stores open at fiscal year end egghead intends to close an additional seven stores in connection with the restructuring and reorganization 
of the stores open at the end of fiscal   not including the egghead computer surplus store  were approximately twice the size of egghead s traditional stores 
twelve of the larger stores are existing stores that have been open for more than one year and were expanded  remodeled or relocated 
in fiscal  egghead generated comparable store sales and operating profit increases of and  respectively  from these stores 
nevertheless  the overall performance of the larger format stores has been mixed 
egghead will continue to evaluate the performance of its larger format stores and expects that further refinement of its store format will be required 
net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of from the million in the prior year 
the decrease in sales is attributable primarily to the closure of stores during fiscal and a decrease in overall sales volume 
egghead closed stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal year sales for fiscal from the egghead stores that were open at the end of fiscal accounted for million or of egghead s fiscal year retail store revenue 
net sales in fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from net sales of million in fiscal fiscal sales decreases resulted primarily from the reduction in the average number of stores in full operation during the year 
fiscal sales increased million or from fiscal sales of million 
fiscal increases primarily resulted from an increase in hardware and related accessories sales  a full year of sales from a direct mail company acquired by egghead in and broad product price reductions initiated in comparable retail store sales measure sales for stores that were open in both periods being evaluated 
comparable store sales decreased during fiscal due to a general sales decrease in fiscal and to microsoft s launch of windows in fiscal  which increased sales in of the retail stores that were open at the end of fiscal  egghead expects that stores will be retained after completion of the restructuring and reorganization 
these stores recorded a decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal compared to the decrease of in comparable store sales for the entire company 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  these stores generated a comparable store increase of over the fourth quarter of fiscal these stores also contributed store operating profits before distribution  marketing and corporate overhead expenses in excess of total year to date retail store operating profits 
the increases in comparable retail store sales for fiscal and were and  respectively  over the prior periods 
comparable store sales for fiscal were flat compared to fiscal  despite the release of windows in fiscal  due to an overall decrease in sales of other products 
as discussed above  fiscal comparable store sales benefited primarily from price reductions initiated in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin consists of net sales minus cost of sales  including certain buying  occupancy and distribution costs 
gross margin is primarily affected by sales volume and the mix of pc products sold  as well as vendor rebates and freight and obsolescence charges 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales may also be significantly affected by industry wide pricing pressure related to both competitors pricing and vendors pricing 
beginning in fiscal  egghead began to increase the percentage of hardware and other non software products offered 
such products typically generate higher gross margins in absolute dollars  though not necessarily as a percentage of sales 
gross margin for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the inventory liquidation associated with the closure of stores in connection with the reorganization and restructuring 
excluding the million gross margin restructuring charge  gross margin in fiscal would have been million  or of net sales 
the store closures in will substantially reduce the quantities of merchandise purchased by egghead and may adversely affect egghead s ability to obtain volume discounts in the future 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was also reduced by increased sales of hardware and other non software related products  which represented approximately of net sales in fiscal  compared to approximately in fiscal sales of hardware and other non software related products represented of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to in the fourth quarter of  and egghead expects sales of such products to increase as a proportion of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of in fiscal compared to in fiscal years fiscal gross margin was negatively affected by the pricing and promotion terms relating to the sale of microsoft windows and a clearance sale during the last quarter of the fiscal year 
fiscal gross margin reflects a full year of broad price reductions initiated in the middle of selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
sg a expense consists primarily of operating expense  excluding occupancy for retail  egghead and internet operations and headquarters expense  and excluding product procurement and marketing 
such operating expenses include payroll and benefits for headquarters and distribution support functions  telecommunications  credit card processing costs and supplies 
sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal  compared to of sales for the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to reduced sales and to restructuring and reorganization costs of million 
these costs consist primarily of payroll and other costs relating to the closure of the stores announced in january 
in fiscal  sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was compared to in fiscal the increased expenses in fiscal include million incurred in connection with the relocation of the corporate headquarters to liberty lake and million related to development of products by elekom 
sg a expense as a percentage of net sales not including relocation expense and elekom expenditures would have been in fiscal and in fiscal the improvement in the fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal was due mainly to sales increasing at a faster rate than expenses during the period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense  net of amounts included in cost of sales  primarily includes depreciation of egghead s headquarters facility and capital equipment 
the expense of million for fiscal declined compared to million for the prior year  primarily due to the disposition of fixed assets related to the sale of the cge division 
depreciation and amortization expense  net of amounts included in cost of sales  of million in fiscal was consistent with fiscal assuming consummation of the merger  depreciation and amortization expense will increase in fiscal and subsequent periods as a result of the amortization of goodwill resulting from the merger 
see pro forma condensed financial statements 
other income  net 
interest income in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
increases in interest income are primarily due to the increases in cash balances discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  fiscal included theft insurance recovery of million  representing settlement of an insurance claim  net of expenses  for inventory stolen by members of a multistate shoplifting ring from numerous retail stores during fiscal years  and discontinued operations all results for the operations of the cge division are reported as a discontinued operation 
certain general  administrative and distribution areas have traditionally supported all of egghead s business lines 
the expenses included in the results of the discontinued operations reflect only those activities directly related to the cge division 
gain on the disposition of the discontinued operation during fiscal was million million after tax 
the sales price for the cge division was million in cash  which did not include the accounts receivable  which were collected during fiscal the reported gain is net of fixed assets and lease write offs of million  transaction  legal and accounting fees of million  transition period employment costs of million and costs of million related to the fulfillment of post sale obligations 
loss from the discontinued operation was million net of tax for the fiscal year 
the major components of the loss were inventory write offs of million  accounts receivable write offs of million  fixed asset dispositions and equipment lease buyouts of million  warehouse closing costs of million and operating losses  severance and other costs of million 
net sales for the discontinued operations of cge declined million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to disruptions in sales efforts related to the consolidation of its regional sales offices and egghead s headquarters relocation to liberty lake  washington 
gross margin for cge as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared to in the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the sales shortfall 
liquidity and capital resources in recent fiscal years  egghead has funded its operations through cash provided by operations  bank lines of credit and the proceeds of the sale of the cge division 
egghead elected not to renew its bank line of credit after the line expired in april because it had sufficient cash to fund operations 
egghead had no outstanding borrowings under the line at the expiration date 
cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at the end of fiscal to million at march  the increase in the cash balance was primarily due to the sale of the cge division  the collection of related accounts receivable and a liquidation of merchandise inventories  offset by a reduction in accounts payable 
egghead expects these cash balances will be adequate to meet future cash requirements for operations 
net property and equipment decreased million from million at the end of fiscal to million at march  the decrease is principally due to the sale of the cge division  the disposition of assets related to the restructuring and reorganization and normal depreciation 
net property and equipment increased million from million at the end of fiscal to million at march  the increase is principally due to the addition or remodel of the larger format stores  as well as improvements to the corporate headquarters building in liberty lake  offset by depreciation expense 
capital expenditures in fiscal totaled million  primarily for new stores and computer hardware 
capital expenditures in fiscal totaling million included leasehold improvements  fixtures  computer hardware  software and communications equipment  principally due to the remodel or addition of larger format stores and the relocation of the corporate headquarters 
capital expenditures in fiscal totaling approximately million included land and a building in liberty lake  washington for the corporate headquarters  computer software and communications equipment 
new accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

this new standard requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be evaluated to determine whether the carrying amount is recoverable based on estimated future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and cash to be received upon disposal of the assets 
egghead adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a charge of million  after tax  for fiscal this charge represents the write down of egghead s property held for sale in kalispell  montana and the related goodwill 
the impact on continuing operations during fiscal was million  primarily related to egghead s fourth quarter restructuring and reorganization and the corresponding impairment of certain real estate assets that are held for sale 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this new standard requires entities to choose either a fair value based method or an intrinsic value based method of accounting for all employee stock compensation plans 
egghead adopted the standard during fiscal and has historically and will in the future use the intrinsic value based method  which requires no compensation cost to be recognized at the date of the stock compensation grant if the option is granted at the current market price 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas 
sfas establishes new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no
