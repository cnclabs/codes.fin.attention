item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general north carolina natural gas corporation ncng or the company is engaged primarily in the business of transporting and distributing natural gas at regulated retail rates to customers in cities  towns and communities  as well as at regulated wholesale rates to four municipal gas distribution systems  in southcentral and eastern north carolina 
for the fiscal year ended september   ncng had a peak number of approximately  total natural gas customers 
the company also has a propane division with approximately  customers 
ncng continues to expand its transmission and distribution systems to keep pace with the economic development in residential  commercial and industrial growth in its service area 
the company s financial position and results of operations are substantially dependent upon its receiving adequate and timely increases in rates  which are regulated by the north carolina utilities commission ncuc 
results of operations earnings ncng earned million or per share in  compared to million or per share in and million or per share in included in the current year earnings is a nonrecurring after tax credit of per share related to settlement of a long standing regulatory matter see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the nonrecurring credit of per share  the increase in earnings in compared to was primarily due to higher industrial throughput volumes driven by customer growth and warmer than normal weather which resulted in fewer curtailments of industrial customers while the weather normalization adjustment wna stabilized the company s margins from space heating customers  an increase in the residential and commercial customer base of approximately which resulted in increased facilities charges as well as increased sales volumes in the summer months  and lower utility interest charges 
while the weather for fiscal was warmer than normal and warmer than  total dekatherms dt delivered increased nearly to million dt compared to million dt in the increase in earnings in compared to was due to increased deliveries of natural gas  a general rate increase effective november   higher residential  commercial and municipal throughput volumes due to colder than normal weather  strong customer growth in the core market residential and commercial sectors  and higher earnings realized by the company s propane division and subsidiary gas marketing activities 
throughput and margin the company s total throughput volumes in increased by million dt to million dt 
industrial volumes increased by million dt while wholesale  residential  and commercial volumes decreased   and  dts  respectively 
the overall increase in volumes sold or transported was primarily the result of increased throughput to interruptible industrial customers resulting from the addition of new customers  increased production levels  and fewer interruptions of service during the winter period due to the warmer than normal weather 
ncng continued adding natural gas customers at an above average growth rate in the addition of about  customers in represents a growth rate of  compared to the national average of less than for all natural gas distribution utilities 
even though warmer than normal weather in the winter decreased sales of gas to residential and commercial customers  the company did not realize a proportional decrease in margins from such customers because of the operation of the wna mechanism which stabilizes the company s margin from space heating customers based on normal weather 
the wna provided a margin of million in compared to a reduction in margin of million in when the weather was colder than normal 
the following chart compares margins in fiscal years and by customer class margin increase decrease customer class amount in thousands residential   commercial and small industrial    industrial electric power generation    municipal wholesale   total    the residential  commercial and small industrial margins increased as compared to last year 
the increase in customers as well as the wna as explained above  contributed to the margin growth 
industrial and electric power generation margins increased due to customer growth  higher throughput volumes because of the addition of new customers  higher production levels and less curtailment of interruptible customers  and hot summer weather which led to increased deliveries of gas to electric generators 
municipal margins decreased due to warmer than normal weather and the loss of one large industrial customer served by one of the cities 
the company s total margin growth in was million  and ncng s total throughput in increased million dt  or to million dt 
these increases were caused primarily by customer growth of over  and weather in that was colder than normal and colder than revenues and cost of gas in the natural gas distribution industry in recent years  gross margin  rather than revenues  has become a more valid indicator of the results of operations 
two factors account for this change the steadily increasing incidence of customers acquiring their own gas supplies and utilizing the utility for transportation only  and the increased volatility in the commodity price of natural gas 
this volatility in the commodity cost of gas  which trended upward in  caused ncng s transportation service volumes to increase by million dt to million dt in compared to million dt in and million dt in conversely  the company s sales service volumes decreased million dt to million dt in compared to million dt in and million dt in in general  the margin earned on gas transported is equal to the margin earned on gas sold  however  transportation  which replaces sales  results in lower revenues because transportation rates exclude the commodity cost of gas which is paid by the customer directly to its gas supplier 
the company still delivers the gas and earns transportation revenue equivalent to the margin contained in a comparable sales rate 
in  the company s operating revenues and cost of gas decreased million and million  respectively  primarily due to transportation customers purchasing their own gas as discussed above 
partially offsetting the volume related decrease in the cost of gas were average increases of in the commodity prices of gas in over operating revenues increased million in over because of increased gas costs to sales customers  the switch by industrial customers from transportation to sales services  a general rate increase effective november  and customer growth 
gas costs increased million in due to a significant increase in the average commodity cost of gas of in compared to and a sales volume increase of million dt over operating expenses and taxes ncng s total operating expenses and taxes increased to million in  compared to million in and million in as a percentage of margin  the amount was  up slightly from in  and down from in operations and maintenance expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in this increase was primarily due to increased customer collections expense  including an increase in the write offs for uncollectable accounts  higher distribution maintenance and transmission operations expenses  including the increased cost of gas used in company compressor stations  higher wages and higher costs associated with customer service and sales promotion efforts for the rapidly growing customer base 
the company s depreciation rates must be approved by the ncuc 
in connection with the company s general rate case effective november   the composite depreciation rate was increased to for and from in accordingly  the increase in depreciation expense for relates to the increases in both the depreciation rate and the gross plant investment 
in  depreciation expense increased in line with the increase in depreciable plant related to customer growth and system strengthening 
the most significant component of general taxes is gross receipts taxes related to operating revenues 
accordingly  the decrease in general taxes in is in line with the lower operating revenues 
general taxes also include payroll and property taxes which have increased in each of the three years ended september   due to the company s higher compensation expenses and its additional investment in plant in service 
income tax expense increased in and is in line with the increase in pretax income 
the effective income tax rate of for is not significantly different from and  with the equity component of allowance for funds used during construction afudc the largest variable influencing the effective tax rate 
other income  net  which consists of income from nonutility operations such as propane sales  merchandise sales and jobbing  increased to million for compared to million in this increase is due to a million nonrecurring credit as a result of the settlement of the long standing regulatory matter  offset by decreased net income from propane operations due to warmer than normal weather and lower merchandise and jobbing sales 
other income  net  increased to million in from  in due primarily to higher propane sales related to a colder than normal winter in afudc increased to million in from  in due to an increase of approximately in construction spending in compared to afudc decreased to  in from  in due to a decrease in construction spending compared to liquidity and capital resources the company has bank lines of credit totaling million  including million on a committed basis 
at september   million was outstanding at interest rates of about  compared to notes payable outstanding of million with interest rates ranging from to at september  the increase of million was due to increased capital expenditures in the company s capital requirements reflect the capital intensive nature of its business and are attributable principally to its construction program  retirement of long term debt and working capital requirements such as receivables and gas in storage 
the company relies on short term bank loans and cash flows from operations to finance construction expenditures  and it replaces the bank loans with permanent financing when total borrowings approach the maximum level available under the lines of credit or when conditions are favorable for obtaining long term capital 
construction expenditures of million in were higher than by million 
this was due primarily to preliminary work done on the duplin onslow county expansion project the expansion project  significant additional system strengthening projects and an additional compressor at the battleboro compressor station 
this spending was partially offset by the receipt of  from ncng s expansion fund  which is administered by the ncuc 
the company has budgeted fiscal construction expenditures of million  including million for the expansion project  approximately million for system strengthening  compressors and related projects  and million for new customer growth 
the estimated cost of the expansion project has increased to million from the original estimate of million 
this increase is due to continued delays and changes related to environmental issues on the on base portion of the project 
the company will request approval to use an additional million from the expansion fund to cover the incremental increase in costs of the project 
should the ncuc deny additional funding for the expansion project from the expansion fund  the company has no obligation to complete the project 
the company s ratio of long term debt to total capitalization was at september   down from at september   due to a long term debt sinking fund payment of million and an increase in stockholders investment of million 
management believes that the generation of net cash from operating activities together with its bank lines of credit and other sources will be sufficient to provide for its construction program through fiscal next summer the company expects to issue additional long term debt for the first time since november in  the company expects to raise approximately million of additional equity from its dividend reinvestment plan  its employee stock purchase plan and its key employee stock option plan 
common equity realized from such sources totaled million in and million in subsequent to year end  the company s board of directors adopted a shareholders rights plan which is designed to prevent coercive or unfair takeover tactics or unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the company in a transaction that the board believes is not in the best interest of the company s shareholders 
the shareholder rights plan was not adopted as a response to any effort to acquire the company or voting control of the company  and the board is not aware of any such effort 
environmental issues the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental impact and explore corrective action at one manufactured gas plant site in kinston  north carolina see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also owns another former mgp site in new bern  north carolina  and was a previous owner of three small former mgp sites 
no significant problems have arisen to date 
the company believes that any appreciable costs not previously provided for will be recovered from third parties  including liability insurance carriers  or in natural gas rates as approved by the commission in the october rate order 
regulatory accounting ncng is subject to the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to the company representing certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
in the event that all or a portion of the company s operations are no longer subject to the provisions of statement no 
 ncng would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the other assets  including plant  and write down the assets  if impaired  to their fair value 
to date  no such write downs or write offs have been made  nor are any expected to be made in the future 
competition and growth the natural gas industry continues to evolve into a more competitive environment 
the company has competed successfully with other forms of energy such as electricity  oil and propane 
the principle considerations have been price and accessibility 
the company has also competed successfully through its marketing subsidiary with other natural gas marketers in its unbundled sales to industrial and other large volume customers 
further unbundling of services to commercial and residential customers could increase competition for commodity sales services  but not for the distribution of natural gas 
the company does not expect the ncuc to require further unbundling in the near future 
ncng has a balanced gas supply portfolio which provides security of supply at the lowest reasonable cost as the ncuc has found in all of the company s annual prudency reviews  the most recent of which was completed in april in response to the growth of the natural gas business in north carolina  ncng established a new subsidiary  ncng energy corporation energy  in august to participate in two partnerships with subsidiaries of transco  piedmont natural gas company piedmont and public service company of north carolina  inc public service regarding gas supply and pipeline projects affecting the entire state 
in april  energy transferred its ownership in these two projects to two new subsidiaries  ncng pine needle investment corporation pine needle investment and ncng cardinal pipeline corporation cardinal pipeline investment 
pine needle investment is a equity owner in pine needle lng company  llc  which owns the site and is building and plans to operate a bcf liquefied natural gas plant lng at a site near transco s main line 
this plant is scheduled to be in service by the winter heating season 
ncng has committed to take or  dts of the lng capacity in order to support continuing growth in its customer base expected over the next five years 
additionally  cardinal pipeline investment and its partners  have organized another company  called cardinal expansion company  llc cardinal  which will take over an existing intrastate pipeline now owned by piedmont and public service 
the pipeline will be extended from burlington  north carolina  to an interconnection with the systems of public service and ncng southeast of raleigh at clayton  north carolina 
the expanded pipeline would enable ncng to take substantial additional volumes of natural gas year round into the middle of its system 
cardinal pipeline investment has a equity interest in cardinal 
expansion projects the company has received ncuc approval for one expansion project in duplin onslow counties with the marine base camp lejeune the largest customer to be served from this project see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is considering another expansion project in bertie and martin counties and plans to seek ncuc approval in fiscal to use expansion funds to finance a portion of that project 
year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
ncng has chosen to replace all critical systems with new software which is year compliant 
existing non year compliant systems have been and will continue to be replaced as the new software systems are installed 
all work will be completed in mid fiscal forward looking statements statements made herein and elsewhere in this annual report which are not historical in fact are forward looking statements 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company cautions that  while it believes such statements to be reasonable and makes them in good faith  they almost always vary from actual results  and the differences between assumed facts or basis and actual results can be material  depending upon the circumstances 
investors should be aware of important factors that could have a material impact on future results
