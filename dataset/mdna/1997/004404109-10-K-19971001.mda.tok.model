item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company sells products to carriers and enterprises  both through direct channels and through strategic alliance partners  for delivery to end users in the united states and internationally 
since june  the company  consistent with its strategic emphasis  has derived most of its revenue from sales of its carrier network products to traditional carriers 
the company expects such sales to increase as a percentage of its revenue for at least the next several years 
the balance of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of products and software licenses to new and emerging carriers and to enterprise customers  including agencies of the us government 
the company s products typically are sold pursuant to contracts having an aggregate value of several hundred thousand to several million dollars 
contracts for the company s traditional carrier network products typically require the delivery of products  including hardware and licensed software  along with installation  training and post contract support services 
contracts for new and emerging carriers and enterprise networks typically require the company to license  in perpetuity  software applications and provide hardware and services that include installation  training and post contract support 
software  hardware and services sold pursuant to new and emerging carrier and enterprise network contracts are separately priced 
at the expiration of the post contract support period  customers are offered the opportunity to purchase additional support services 
the company derives revenues from software license fees  hardware sales  and product related services 
revenue from hardware sales is recognized upon delivery while revenue from product related services is recognized as the services are rendered 
the company s software licenses to end users generally provide for an initial license fee to use the product in perpetuity 
under certain contracts  the company licenses the source code of its software to resellers for subsequent modification and resale 
revenue from software licenses is recognized after the software has been delivered  all significant uncertainties regarding acceptance have expired and all significant obligations have been fulfilled 
costs relating to insignificant obligations are accrued 
revenue from contracts with payment terms in excess of one year is recognized to the extent of payments that are probable and due within one year 
revenue related to obligations to provide post contract customer support without charge is unbundled from the license and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from maintenance services is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
for contracts involving significant production  modification or customization of hardware and software  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method  based on performance milestones specified in the contract  which fairly reflect progress toward contract completion 
the company sells its products either as components in the products or systems developed and marketed by its strategic partners or directly to end users 
the company typically experiences higher margins in connection with its direct sales contracts  offset in part by relatively higher sales and marketing expenses 
the company tracks two types of backlog order backlog  which represents signed purchase orders  and contract backlog  which represents signed project contracts that become order backlog upon the signing of specific purchase orders 
order backlog was million at june   compared to million at june  the company s revenue typically is concentrated among certain customers  the largest of which in fiscal consisted of telmex  samsung electronics  lg information communications  ltd 
and anstec  inc these customers represented approximately   and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended june  substantially all of the company s revenue is derived from dollar denominated sales and  although the company in its most recent fiscal year had significant sales to mexico and the republic of south korea  the company does not have significant foreign operations 
prior to fiscal  the company s sales had been principally to its strategic alliance partners in the united states or to end users in foreign countries 
during fiscal  the company also sold its products and software licenses to foreign strategic partners  the sales to which represent of annual revenues 
the company s customers continue to pay for products in us dollars 
all products are shipped from the united states pursuant to terms of orders issued by customers 
the company has experienced more favorable cash collection cycles for its international sales than its domestic sales 
for fiscal  the accounts receivable turnover rates annual sales average of year end accounts receivable were for sales to us customers and for sales to foreign customers  and the accounts receivable turnover rates in days were for us sales and for sales to foreign customers 
though the company has not historically experienced the greater risk that is generally associated with cash cycles for sales to international customers  the company believes that past experience is not necessarily indicative of future results and that as its sales directly to foreign customers increase it may experience greater delays in collections 
as a result of the size of most of its contracts and orders  the significant length of sales cycles and the complexities which arise from time to time in completing any given contract or order  the company typically experiences fluctuations in quarterly and year to year results 
marketing in foreign countries  particularly in asia and other emerging markets  frequently requires extensive field testing and may result in delays in the timing and closing of sales by the company s strategic alliance partners  which in turn may delay orders of the company s products 
the company has experienced significant delays in timing of revenue related to sales to end users in overseas markets 
during fiscal  the company reclassified expenses for services provided by certain strategic alliance partners in connection with the installation and integration of the company s products 
as a result  certain fiscal amounts have been reclassified from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of products  software licenses and services  to conform with fiscal financial statement presentation 
the company s cost of products  software licenses and services consists of the cost of product engineering and production  cost of customer support personnel  license fees paid to third party software vendors  amortization of capitalized software development costs  the cost of hardware purchased by the company for incorporation into its products and expenses for services provided by certain alliance partners in connection with the installation and integration of the company s products 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs to support the company s sales and administrative functions 
included within these costs are salaries  bonuses  sales commission  rent  insurance  depreciation and non product amortization expenses 
also included are costs associated with the company s participation in trade shows and industry conferences  and related travel and other promotional costs 
research and development expenses consist of personnel costs related to the design and development of the company s products 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
however  computer software development costs incurred after the technological feasibility of a product is established and until the product is available for release to customers are capitalized 
capitalized software and purchased technology costs are amortized on a product by product basis based on the greater of the ratio of current sales to estimated total future sales or a straight line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the product no greater than three years including the current year

the increased expenses are attributable to costs associated with increased infrastructure required to support the company s growth  costs associated with increased sales and marketing efforts that include the cost of an expanded sales force  and to increased rent incurred in conjunction with the company s relocation to a larger facility 
the company anticipates that the continued expansion of its sales efforts  both domestically and internationally  will increase its sales and marketing expense and may have an adverse effect on the company s earnings

the increase in these expenses is attributed to costs associated with the company s continued expansion of marketing programs

large orders typically are preceded by long sales cycles and  accordingly  the timing of such an order has been and will continue to be difficult to predict 
the failure to obtain one or more large orders  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s results also vary based on the type and quantity of products shipped  the timing of product shipments  the relative revenue mix in a given period and the resulting margins 
the variations may be material 
the timing of large orders depends on a variety of factors affecting the capital spending decisions of the company s customers  which  in turn  can affect the company s quarterly operating results 
these factors include changes in governmental regulation  changes in the customers competitive environment  pricing policies by the company or its competitors  personnel changes  demand for the company s products  the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of its products on a timely basis  and the mix of direct and indirect sales and general economic factors 
the company s sales cycle  from initial contact to contract execution  orders for products and delivery of product  also varies substantially from customer to customer and from project to project 
the purchase of traditional carrier network products  new and emerging carrier network products and enterprise network management products generally involves a significant commitment of customer capital and management time 
the sales cycle associated with the purchase of the company s products is subject to a number of additional significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which the company has little or no control 
the company s expense levels are based  in party  on its expectations as to future revenue levels 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be materially adversely affected 
based upon all of the foregoing  the company believes that quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
further  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million from  at june  to million at june  the increase in cash is attributable to funds generated from the company s initial public offering of common stock  which raised net proceeds of million 
cash and cash equivalents increased  from  at june  to  at june  this increase is due primarily to a combination of cash provided by operations and financing activities offset  in part  by investment in property and capitalized software development costs 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents of  during the year ended june  is primarily attributable to increased borrowings 
net cash used for provided by operating activities for the year ended june    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash used for operating activities from fiscal to fiscal primarily reflects a significant increase in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  which reflect the increase in the company s sales volume  and a decrease in deferred revenues of million  partially offset by net income of million and increases in accrued expenses and deferred income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year to is due primarily to the company s return to profitability with net income of million in fiscal  as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue of million  million and million  respectively  offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
net cash used for investing activities of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  reflect purchases of property and equipment and the capitalization of software development costs 
purchases of property and equipment  consisting primarily of computers and office equipment  were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
capitalized software development costs were million  million  and million in fiscal    respectively 
the company expects it will continue to make investments in both capitalized software development and in fixed assets for infrastructure to support anticipated business growth 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended june   was million 
during fiscal  the company received net proceeds of million from the initial public offering of its common stock 
in addition  the company received proceeds of million from the exercise of common stock options 
the company used these proceeds to reduce bank and other debt obligations by million  to pay the withholding tax obligations of million associated with the exercise of employee stock options which were paid for by the employees with the surrender of previously owned shares and to redeem million in outstanding preferred stock 
during the fourth quarter  the company entered into an agreement with its bank to finance  in capital equipment purchases 
also during fiscal  the company entered into a capital lease obligation for an office telephone system 
at june   capitalized lease obligations were million 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal of million is primarily attributable to an increase in borrowings of million  offset by debt payments of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal also reflects increased borrowings of million offset  in part  by in debt repayments 
with the exception of the capital lease referred to above  all of the company s borrowings are from crestar bank of maryland 
the company has two lines of credit with crestar totaling million under which no amounts were outstanding at june  these lines of credit  in the principal amount of million and a million  respectively  each expires on november  borrowings under these facilities bear interest payable monthly  at over the bank s prime rate and are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and specific equipment 
in addition  the company has two term note facilities pursuant to which the company has made borrowings in the aggregate principal amount as of june  of approximately million and million  respectively  which are due in varying monthly installments through june and june  respectively  bear interest at over the bank s prime rate and at the bank s prime rate  respectively  and are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and specific equipment and by the company s general assets  respectively 
these loan arrangements require the company to comply with certain financial covenants 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flows from operations and available bank lines  when renewed as anticipated  will be sufficient to support the company s working capital requirement for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s working capital requirements  the company may be required to raise additional funds 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
in the event that adequate funds are not available  the company s business may be adversely affected 
factors affecting future operating results ace comm provides products to a technology driven industry sector 
therefore  ace comm s success is dependent in part upon factors beyond its control 
this report contains forward looking statements relating to the prospective operating results of the company 
the following are factors which could affect ace comm s future operating results 
these factors are intended to serve as a cautionary statement to statements that may be made  either verbally or in writing  including those in any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of  the company to date  a significant portion of the company s revenue has been derived from substantial orders placed by large organizations 
the company expects that in the future it will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers in any given period for a significant portion of its revenue 
the company s future success may depend upon the continued demand by such customer for its products and services 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellation of orders 
sales to traditional carriers have provided and are expected to continue to provide a majority of revenue 
the company s business is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry  in the united states and internationally  on the continued convergence of voice and data networks and on the evolution and widespread adoption of emerging network technologies 
any decline in the growth of the industry  the failure of these markets to converge or the failure of these network technologies to evolve or achieve widespread market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a key element of the company s business strategy is to develop strategic alliances with leading companies that provide telecommunications services or that manufacture and market network equipment in order to expand the company s distribution channels and enter new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase the number of  or to expand  these types of relationships  in order to market its products effectively  particularly internationally 
the company has expanded its operations rapidly  which has placed significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of the company s operations 
if the company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  the quality of its products and services and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the new and emerging carrier market in the united states and overseas represents a source of growing demand for the company s products  software licenses and services 
in that this market segment is relatively new and in that many of these organizations are in the early stages of their development  financial resources may be limited and may adversely affect their ability to pay for the company s products  software licenses and services 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas 
this statement establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps and making them comparable to international standards 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps  and requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
sfas requires restatement of all prior period earnings per share data presented  and is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods 
earlier application is not permitted 
the company will adopt this statement during the second quarter of fiscal  as required 
accordingly  all prior period eps data will be restated 
to illustrate the effect of adoption  the company has elected to disclose pro forma basic and diluted eps amounts computed using sfas  as permitted by the standard 
the pro forma basic and diluted eps for each of the two years in the period ended june  are set forth below fiscal year ended june  pro forma basic earnings per share pro forma diluted earnings per share
