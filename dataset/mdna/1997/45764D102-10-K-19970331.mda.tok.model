patents and proprietary rights it is the company s policy to aggressively protect its technology by  among other things  filing patent applications for the patentable technologies that it considers important to the development of its business 
the company holds seven issued united states patents  covering various aspects of its radial dilation technology 
the company also has a license agreement giving it exclusive rights  assuming certain defined minimum payments are met  to a related access technology that is covered by two issued and one pending patent 
in addition  during the company obtained a non exclusive license to a patent covering a specialized access device which facilitates the placement of a vision device into the abdominal cavity 
the company holds seven issued united states patents relating to its thermal ablation system technology 
the company also holds five issued united states patents relating to its biocompatible coating technologies 
the company has continued to pursue the expansion of its coating related intellectual property  as opportunities for business partnerships in this area have been pursued 
see innerdyne s products and technology biocompatible coating technologies 
the company also holds eight issued foreign patents  and has filed additional united states and foreign patent applications relating to its various technologies 
in addition to patent rights related to its radial dilation  thermal ablation and biocompatible coating technologies  the company also has a number of issued and pending patents relating to its blood gas exchange  pumping and other technologies 
there can be no assurances that any pending patent applications will be issued in their present scope  or at all 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain patent protection for products and processes  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
although innerdyne has obtained certain patents and applied for additional united states and foreign patents covering certain aspects of its technology  no assurance can be given that any additional patents will be issued or that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide a competitive advantage  or that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involves complex legal and factual questions and therefore may be highly uncertain 
innerdyne also relies upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets 
in addition  whether or not the company s patents are issued  others may hold or receive patents that contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by innerdyne 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry and companies in the medical device industry have used litigation to gain competitive advantage 
litigation involving the company would result in substantial cost to and diversion of management attention from the day to day operation of the business  but could be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets and other specialized knowledge unknown to outside parties  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
an adverse determination in litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties under less favorable terms than might otherwise be possible and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  receive correspondence from third parties claiming that the company s products or technology infringe intellectual property rights of such third parties 
the company and its patent counsel thoroughly review such claims and no such outstanding claims currently exist 
however  there can be no assurance that innerdyne will not receive additional claims that its products or technology infringe third party rights or that third parties will not litigate such claims 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

competition the primary industry in which the company competes  minimally invasive surgery  is dominated by two large  well positioned entities that are intensely competitive and frequently offer substantial discounts as a competitive tactic 
us surgical is primarily engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing surgical wound management products  and has historically been the firm most responsible for providing products that have led to the growth of the industry 
us surgical supplies a broad line of products to the mis industry  including products that facilitate access  assessment and treatment 
ethicon endo surgery ethicon  a johnson johnson company  has made a major investment in the mis field in recent years and is one of the leading suppliers of hospital products in the world 
furthermore  us surgical and ethicon each utilize purchasing contracts that link discounts on the purchase of one product to purchases of other products in their broad product lines 
substantially all of the hospitals in the united states have purchasing contracts with one or both of these entities 
accordingly  customers may be dissuaded from purchasing access products from the company rather than us surgical or ethicon to the extent it would cause them to lose discounts on products that they regularly purchase from us surgical or ethicon 
notwithstanding the challenges faced by the company in selling in a market dominated by two large competitors  the majority of the company s revenues since the fourth quarter of have come from product sales in this market 
us surgical and ethicon purchasing contracts typically include a provision allowing a certain percentage of purchases from other vendors  and the company has taken and intends to continue to take advantage of such provisions 
the company faces a formidable task in successfully gaining significant revenues within the mis access market 
in order to succeed  management believes that the company will need to objectively demonstrate substantial product benefits  and its sales effort must be able to effectively present such benefits to both clinicians and health care administrators 
the mis access market segment is dominated by us surgical and ethicon 
both entities introduced new access devices  trocars with added features  during the past two years 
a number of other entities participate in various segments of the mis access market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete in the mis access market and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the thermal ablation market  the primary competition for the enabl system is current therapies for the treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding  including drug therapy  dilatation and curettage  surgical endometrial ablation and hysterectomy 
the enabl system will also compete against other techniques under development for the treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding  including endometrial ablation techniques that employ rf energy or freezing techniques cryoablation and the uterine balloon therapy system being clinically tested by gynecare  inc there are other companies developing alternative methods of uterine tissue ablation that compete with the enabl system 
there can be no assurance that these companies will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company and us surgical or that would render the company s technologies or products obsolete or not competitive 
such competition could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the entry of large and small companies into the market  the company expects competition for devices and systems used to treat excessive menstrual bleeding to increase 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors intense competition 
government regulation clinical testing  manufacture and sale of the company s products  including the step product line  the enabl system and the company s biocompatible coatings technology  are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the company 
in the united states  medical devices are classified into one of three classes ie  class i  ii or iii on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness 
class i devices are subject to general controls eg  labeling  premarket notification and adherence to gmps and class ii devices are subject to general and special controls eg  performance standards  postmarket surveillance  patient registries and fda guidelines 
generally  class iii devices are those which must receive premarket approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness eg  life sustaining  life supporting and implantable devices  or new devices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices 
before a new device can be introduced in the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain fda clearance of a k notification or approval of a premarket approval pma application 
a pma application must be filed if a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii device for which the fda has called for pmas 
the pma application must contain the results of clinical trials  the results of all relevant bench tests  laboratory and animal studies  a complete description of the device and its components  and a detailed description of the methods  facilities and controls used to manufacture the device 
the fda s review of a pma application generally takes one to two years from the date the pma is accepted for filing  but it may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended by the fda asking for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma  its labeling or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda of pma supplements or new pmas 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing 
if human clinical trials of a device are required  and the device presents a significant risk  the sponsor of the trial usually the manufacturer or the distributor of the device will have to file an investigational device exemption ide application prior to commencing human clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is approved by the fda and one or more appropriate institutional review boards irbs  human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
if the device presents a nonsignificant risk to the patient  a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate irbs without the need for fda approval 
sponsors of clinical trials are permitted to sell investigational devices distributed in the course of the study provided such compensation does not exceed recovery of the costs of manufacture  research  development and handling 
an ide supplement must be submitted to and approved by the fda before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights  safety or welfare of human subjects 
the enabl system will likely be subject to the pma approval process prior to marketing by us surgical within the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval on a timely basis  or at all  and a delay in receipt of or failure to receive such approval would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii medical device or a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for pmas 
the fda recently has been requiring more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past  including in some cases requiring submission of clinical trial data 
the fda may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device  or that additional information is needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
it generally takes from four to months from submission to obtain k premarket clearance  but may take longer 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information is needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could prevent or delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a material adverse effect on the companys business  financial condition and results of operations 
for any of the companys devices cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new k submission 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain k premarket clearance within a reasonable time frame  or at all  for any of the devices or modifications for which it may file a k 
the company has received clearance from the fda for the marketing of its step device for use in accessing the abdominal and thoracic cavities for the performance of minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the company has also received fda clearance for the marketing of its red product for use in the areas of gastrostomy  cystostomy  cholecystotomy  the dilation of biliary and urethral strictures  laparoscopy and enterostomy 
the company has also received market clearance for alternative versions of its step and red products  including products designed to employ its radial dilation technology in vascular and arthroscopic applications and for biliary indications 
although the company has been successful in preparing requests for k clearance  there can be no assurance that k clearances for future products or product modifications can be obtained in a timely manner or at all  or that any existing clearance can be successfully maintained 
a delay in receipt of  or failure to receive or maintain  such clearances would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company is strictly limited to marketing its products for the indications for which they were cleared  physicians are not prohibited by the fda from using the products for indications other than those cleared by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the company will not become subject to fda action resulting from physician use of its products outside of their approved indications 
the company has made modifications to its cleared devices that the company believes do not require the submission of the new k notices 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with any of the companys determinations not to submit a new k notice for any of these changes or would not require the company to submit a new k notice for any of the changes made to the device 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any device modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
any devices manufactured or distributed by the company pursuant to fda clearance or approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies and various foreign governments 
manufacturers of medical devices for marketing in the united states are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed gmp requirements  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
manufacturers must also comply with medical device reporting mdr requirements that a firm report to the fda any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which its product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
current fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses 
the company is registered as a manufacturer of medical devices with the fda 
the company is subject to routine inspection by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with gmp requirements  mdr requirements and other applicable regulations 
failure of the company to maintain satisfactory gmp compliance could have a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products and  in the most serious cases  result in the seizure or recall of products  injunction and or civil fines 
the fda has proposed changes to the gmp regulations that will likely increase the cost of compliance with gmp requirements 
changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future or that laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the companys business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has received certification to iso standards  permitting it to affix the ce mark to its products  allowing unencumbered movement of its products within the european union 
the company is required to undergo periodic surveillance audits to assure continuing compliance with these standards 
failure to demonstrate satisfactory compliance on an ongoing basis could adversely impact innerdyne s ability to distribute its products within the european union 
product liability and insurance the development  manufacturing and sale of the company s products entail the risk of product liability claims  involving both potential financial exposure and associated adverse publicity 
to date  innerdyne has not experienced any product liability claims 
the company s current product liability insurance coverage limits are  per occurrence and  in the aggregate  and there can be no assurance that such coverage limits are adequate to protect the company from any liabilities it might incur in connection with the development  manufacture  and sale of its current and potential products 
in addition  the company may require increased product liability insurance 
product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  if such insurance is available  there can be no assurance that the limits of coverage of such policies will be adequate 
a successful product liability claim in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the companys business  financial condition and results of operation

background innerdyne  inc the company or innerdyne is the successor corporation resulting from the merger of cardiopulmonics  inc cardiopulmonics and innerdyne medical  inc imi in april cardiopulmonics was founded in to develop  manufacture and market proprietary pulmonary and cardiopulmonary products 
these efforts resulted in the development of a blood gas exchange device and proprietary biocompatible coating technologies 
imi was founded in to develop medical devices used in mis procedures incorporating imi s proprietary radial dilation and thermal ablation technologies 
subsequent to the merger  innerdyne discontinued efforts to develop and commercialize the blood gas exchange device and focused primarily on the development  manufacture and commercialization of proprietary mis access products 
innerdyne commercially introduced its first mis access device  step  in the fourth quarter of the company intends to continue developing its proprietary radial dilation and biocompatible coating technologies  internally or through strategic alliances 
risk factors history of losses  profitability uncertain 
innerdyne has experienced operating losses since its inception in december innerdyne reported net losses of million on revenues of million  million on revenues of million and million on revenues of  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   innerdyne had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in the future  the company expects to incur substantial additional operating losses and have cash outflow requirements as a result of expenditures related to expansion of sales and marketing capability  expansion of manufacturing capacity  research and development activities  compliance with regulatory requirements  and possible investment in or acquisition of additional complementary products  technologies or businesses 
the timing and amounts of these expenditures will depend upon many factors  such as the availability of capital  progress of the company s research and development  and factors that may be beyond the company s control  such as the results of product trials  the requirements for and the time required to obtain regulatory approval for existing products and any other products that may be developed or acquired  and the market acceptance of the company s products 
the company believes that it is likely to incur operating losses at least through the cash needs of the company have changed significantly as a result of the merger completed during and the support requirements of the added business focus areas 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to incur losses  that the company will be able to raise cash as necessary to fund operations or that the company will ever achieve profitability 
intense competition 
the primary industry in which the company competes  minimally invasive surgery  is dominated by two large  well positioned entities that are intensely competitive and frequently offer substantial discounts as a competitive tactic 
us surgical is primarily engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing surgical wound management products  and has historically been the firm most responsible for providing products that have led to the growth of the industry 
us surgical supplies a broad line of products to the mis industry  including products which facilitate access  assessment and treatment 
ethicon has made a major investment in the mis field in recent years and is one of the leading suppliers of hospital products in the world 
furthermore  us surgical and ethicon each utilize purchasing contracts that link discounts on the purchase of one product to purchases of other products in their broad product lines 
substantially all of the hospitals in the united states have purchasing contracts with one or both of these entities 
accordingly  customers may be dissuaded from purchasing access products from the company rather than us surgical or ethicon to the extent it would cause them to lose discounts on products that they regularly purchase from us surgical or ethicon 
the company faces a formidable task in successfully gaining significant revenues within the mis access market 
in order to succeed  management believes that the company will need to objectively demonstrate substantial product benefits  and its sales effort must be able to effectively present such benefits to both clinicians and health care administrators 
the mis access market is dominated by us surgical and ethicon 
both entities introduced new access devices  trocars with added features  during the past two years 
a number of other entities participate in various segments of the mis access market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete in the mis access market  and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the thermal ablation market  the primary competition for the enabl system is current therapies for the treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding  including drug therapy  dilatation and curettage  surgical endometrial ablation and hysterectomy 
the enabl system will also compete against other techniques under development for the treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding  including endometrial ablation techniques that employ rf energy or freezing techniques cryoablation and the uterine balloon therapy system being clinically tested by gynecare  inc additionally  there are other companies developing alternative methods of uterine tissue ablation that compete with the enabl system 
there can be no assurance that these companies will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company and us surgical or that would render the company s technologies or products obsolete or not competitive 
such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the entry of large and small companies into the market  the company expects competition for devices and systems used to treat excessive menstrual bleeding to increase 
see item business competition 
continued dependence on step products 
to date  substantially all of the company s revenues from product sales are attributable to step products and innerdyne currently anticipates that sales of step products will represent substantially all of the company s revenues in the immediate future 
accordingly  the success of the company is largely dependent upon increased market acceptance of its step product line by the medical community as a reliable  safe and cost effective access product for minimally invasive surgery 
innerdyne commenced commercial sales of its step product in the fourth quarter of  and to date sales have been made to a relatively limited number of physicians and hospitals 
recommendations and endorsements by influential members of the medical community are important for the increased market acceptance of the company s step products  and there can be no assurance that existing recommendations or endorsements will be maintained or that new ones will be obtained 
failure to increase market acceptance of the company s step products would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business products and technology 
reliance on future products and new applications  uncertainty of technology changes 
the medical device industry is characterized by innovation and technological change 
the company has made significant investments in researching and developing its proprietary technologies  including radial dilation  thermal ablation and biocompatible coatings 
during  the company expects to commercially introduce the one step and the mini step  each of which is a further enhancement of its step product line 
the future success of the company will depend in part on the timely commercial introduction and market acceptance of these products 
there can be no assurance that these products will be timely introduced in commercial quantities  if at all  or that such products will achieve market acceptance 
a failure by the company to timely introduce such products or a failure of such products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the future success of the company will also depend upon  among other factors  its ability to develop and gain regulatory clearance for new and enhanced versions of products in a timely fashion  including  but not limited to  the enabl thermal ablation system being developed with us surgical 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop new products or technologies  manufacture new products in commercial volumes  obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis or gain market acceptance of such products 
delays in development  manufacturing  regulatory approval or market acceptance of new or enhanced products could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business research and development 
limited manufacturing experience  compliance with good manufacturing practices 
the company initiated manufacture of commercial quantities of its step access device in its salt lake city  utah facility during late accordingly  the company has limited experience in manufacturing mis access products or other products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations and other regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
in connection with its iso certification  innerdyne will now undergo periodic audits by a regulatory body 
the company believes that pending regulatory changes currently being introduced by the fda are likely to result in a system of united states regulatory requirements for manufacturers of medical devices which more closely resembles the iso series of quality systems standards adopted by most european countries 
failure to maintain production volumes or increase production volumes in a timely or cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to maintain satisfactory gmp compliance could have a significant impact on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products and  in the most serious cases  result in the seizure or recall of products 
see item business manufacturing 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future depending on the timing and shipment of product orders  new product introductions and changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  the timing and market acceptance of the company s new products and product enhancements  the continued market acceptance of innerdyne s step product line by the medical community  the company s product mix  the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  the extent to which the company recognizes non product revenues during a quarter  and the company s ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for its products 
in particular  fluctuations in production volumes affect gross margins from quarter to quarter 
furthermore  gross margins can fluctuate from quarter to quarter to the extent the company recognizes non product revenue during a quarter because the company derives higher gross margins from non product revenue than from product sales 
in response to competitive pressures or new product introductions  the company may take certain pricing or other actions that could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  new product introductions by the company could contribute to quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
because a substantial portion of the company s revenue in each quarter normally results from orders booked and shipped in the final weeks of that quarter  revenue levels are extremely difficult to predict 
if revenue levels are below expectations  net income will be disproportionately affected because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with its revenue during any particular quarter 
in addition  the company typically does not operate with any material backlog as of any particular date 
as a result of the foregoing factors and potential fluctuations in operating results  results of operations in any particular quarter should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
in addition  in some future quarter the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
reliance on collaborative relationships  restrictions on activities 
the company has entered into  and intends to continue to pursue collaborative arrangements with corporations and research institutions with respect to the research  development  regulatory approval and marketing of certain of its potential products 
innerdyne s future success may depend  in part  on its relationship with such third parties  their strategic interest in the potential products under development and  eventually  their success in marketing or willingness to purchase any such products 
the company s existing and anticipated contracts with such third parties restrict the rights of innerdyne to engage in certain areas of product development  manufacturing and marketing 
in addition  these third parties may have the unilateral right to terminate any such arrangement without significant penalty 
there can be no assurance that innerdyne will be successful in establishing or maintaining any such collaborative arrangements or that any such arrangements will be successful 
limited sales  marketing and distribution experience 
innerdyne began commercial sales of its first mis access product in the fourth quarter of and  therefore  has limited sales  marketing and distribution experience 
the company is marketing its mis access products mainly to general surgeons  gynecologists and pediatric laparoscopists 
in the united states  innerdyne markets its products primarily through direct representatives who are employed by the company within selected geographical areas and a network of independent sales representatives who typically sell other complementary mis products to the same customer base 
if the need arises  the company may expand its sales force  which will require recruiting and training additional personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and train such additional personnel in a timely fashion 
loss of a significant number of innerdyne s current sales personnel or independent sales representatives  or failure to attract additional personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects to market its products outside of the united states through international distributors in selected foreign countries after regulatory approvals  if necessary  are obtained 
although innerdyne currently has relationships with a limited number of international distributors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to build a network of international distributors capable of effectively marketing its mis access products or that such distributors will generate significant sales of such products 
the company has limited experience in marketing its products  and faces substantial competition from well entrenched and formidable competitors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully achieve acceptable levels of product sales at prices which provide an adequate return 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain patent protection for products and processes  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
although innerdyne has obtained certain patents and applied for additional united states and foreign patents covering certain aspects of its technology  no assurance can be given that any additional patents will be issued or that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide a competitive advantage  or that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involves complex legal and factual questions and therefore may be highly uncertain 
innerdyne also relies upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets 
in addition  whether or not the company s patents are issued  others may hold or receive patents that contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by innerdyne 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry and companies in the medical device industry have used litigation to gain competitive advantage 
litigation involving the company would result in substantial cost to and diversion of management attention from the day to day operation of the business  but could be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets and other specialized knowledge unknown to outside parties  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
an adverse determination in litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties under less favorable terms than might otherwise be possible and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  receive correspondence from third parties claiming that the company s products or technology infringe intellectual property rights of such third parties 
the company and its patent counsel thoroughly review such claims and no such outstanding claims currently exist 
however  there can be no assurance that innerdyne will not receive additional claims that its products or technology infringe third party rights or that third parties will not litigate such claims 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

government regulation 
clinical testing  manufacture and sale of the company s products  including the step product line  the enabl system and the company s biocompatible coatings technology  are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the company 
before a new device can be introduced in the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain fda clearance of k notification or approval of a pma 
a pma application must be filed if a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii device for which the fda has called for pmas 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing 
the enabl system will likely be subject to the pma approval process prior to marketing by us surgical within the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval on a timely basis  or at all  and a delay in receipt of or failure to receive such approval would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii medical device or a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for pmas 
for any of the company s devices cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new k submission 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain k premarket clearance within a reasonable time frame  or at all  for any of the devices or modifications for which it may file a k 
the company has received clearance from the fda for the marketing of its step device for use in accessing the abdominal and thoracic cavities for the performance of minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the company has also received fda clearance for the marketing of its red product for use in the areas of gastrostomy  cystostomy  cholecystotomy  the dilation of biliary and urethral strictures  laparoscopy and enterostomy 
the company has also received market clearance for alternative versions of its step and red products  including products designed to employ its radial dilation technology in vascular and arthroscopic applications and for biliary indications 
although the company has been successful in preparing requests for k clearance  there can be no assurance that k clearances for future products or product modifications can be obtained in a timely manner or at all  or that any existing clearance can be successfully maintained 
a delay in receipt of  or failure to receive or maintain  such clearances would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company is strictly limited to marketing its products for the indications for which they were cleared  physicians are not prohibited by the fda from using the products for indications other than those cleared by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the company will not become subject to fda action resulting from physician use of its products outside of their approved indications 
the company has made modifications to its cleared devices that the company believes do not require the submission of new k notices 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with any of the company s determinations not to submit a new k notice for any of these changes or would not require the company to submit a new k notice for any of the changes made to the device 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any device modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
any devices manufactured or distributed by the company pursuant to fda clearance or approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies and various foreign governments 
manufacturers of medical devices for marketing in the united states are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed gmp requirements  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
manufacturers must also comply with medical device reporting mdr requirements that a firm report to the fda any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which its product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
the company is registered as a manufacturer of medical devices with the fda 
the company is subject to routine inspection by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with gmp requirements  mdr requirements and other applicable regulations 
failure of the company to maintain satisfactory gmp compliance could have a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products and  in the most serious cases  could result in the seizure or recall of products  injunction and or civil fines 
see manufacturing and item business government regulation 
dependence on sole sources 
the materials utilized in the company s mis products consist of both standard and custom components that are purchased from a variety of independent sources 
the plastic parts used in the step product are injection molded by outside vendors 
the majority of these parts are produced utilizing molds that have been specially machined for and are owned by the company 
although the company maintains significant inventories of molded parts  any inability to utilize these molds for any reason might have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its customers demand for product 
in addition to plastic parts produced from injection molds owned by the company  a number of other materials are available only from a limited number of sources at the present time  including the sheath component of the company s step products 
efforts to identify and qualify additional sources of this sheath component and other key materials and components are underway 
although innerdyne believes that alternative sources of these components can be obtained  internal testing and qualification of substitute vendors could require significant lead times and additional regulatory submissions 
there can be no assurance that such internal testing and qualification or additional regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely fashion  if at all 
any interruption of supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products and  therefore  on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business manufacturing 
uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement 
in the united states  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians  that purchase medical devices  such as the company s products  generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the medical device is being used 
in addition  certain health care providers are moving toward a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
managed care providers are attempting to control the cost of health care by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods utilized by third party health care payors 
furthermore  the company could be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private health care payors  particularly to the extent any such changes affect reimbursement for procedures in which the company s products are used 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from health care payors for procedures in which the company s products are used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the company obtains the necessary foreign regulatory approvals  market acceptance of the company s products in international markets would be dependent  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
the company intends to seek international reimbursement approvals  although there can be no assurance that any such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if at all  and failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of the company s products in the international markets in which such approvals are sought 
dependence on international sales 
in the future  the company expects to derive an increasing portion of its revenue from international sales 
to the extent that the company s international sales increase in future periods  a significant portion of the company s revenues could be subject to the risks associated with international sales  including economic or political instability  shipping delays  changes in applicable regulatory policies  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and various trade restrictions  all of which could have significant impact on the company s ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
future imposition of  or significant increases in the level of  customs duties  import quotas or other trade restrictions could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the regulation of medical devices  particularly in the european economic community  continues to expand and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company 
dependence on key personnel 
innerdyne is dependent upon a limited number of key management and technical personnel 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the company will compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

product liability  claims in excess of insurance coverage 
the development  manufacture and sale of the company s products entail the risk of product liability claims  involving both potential financial exposure and associated adverse publicity 
the company s current product liability insurance coverage limits are  per occurrence and  in the aggregate  and there can be no assurance that such coverage limits are adequate to protect the company from any liabilities it might incur in connection with the development  manufacture and sale of its current and potential products 
in addition  the company may require increased product liability insurance 
product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  if such insurance is available  there can be no assurance that the limits of coverage of such policies will be adequate 
a successful product liability claim in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation

stock price volatility 
the stock market in general and stocks of medical device companies in particular  have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the market price of the common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
factors such as fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  fda and international regulatory actions  actions with respect to reimbursement matters  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by the company or others  changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding the company  other medical device companies or the medical device industry generally or general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock

environmental regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  manufacture and disposal of toxic and other hazardous substances used to manufacture the company s products 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable governmental environmental regulations 
nevertheless  the failure by the company to comply with current or future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on the company  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
compliance with such regulations could require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous or toxic substances  could subject the company to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statutes 
the imposition of such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
control by directors and principal stockholders 
as of february   directors and principal stockholders of the company  and certain of their affiliates  beneficially own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these persons  as a group  may be able to control the company and significantly affect the direction of the company s affairs and business  including any determination with respect to the acquisition or disposition of assets by the company  future issuances of common stock or other securities by the company and the election of directors 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
anti takeover effect of certain charter provisions of common stock 
provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation that allow the company to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders as well as the fact that the company s certificate of incorporation does not permit stockholders to cumulate votes in the election of directors may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of the company 
certain provisions of delaware law applicable to the company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving the company  including section  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock  the inability of stockholders to cumulate votes in the election of directors and provisions of delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  including without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock 
the possible issuance of preferred stock and these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock

product sales increased to  in from  in and  in  reflecting continued acceptance of the step device  which was commercially introduced in the fourth quarter of licensing  contract and grant revenues were   and  in  and  respectively 
these revenues related to agreements with third parties covering the development of the company s proprietary thermal ablation technology  and licensing of the company s proprietary biocompatible coatings and radial dilation technology 
licensing  contract and grant revenues fluctuate from year to year  and from quarter to quarter  based upon the number of agreements in effect and the amount and timing of the payments to be made to innerdyne pursuant to agreements 
total costs and expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in expenses in grew because of increased costs of sales on higher sales volume  and included clinical  research and development and regulatory expenses related to the enabl system and higher sales and marketing expenses related to the commercialization of the company s mis products  including step and reposable step

cost of product sales in  and late include start up manufacturing and pilot production expense 
the increase each year was due to the resulting production of higher volumes of the step device 
although the company anticipates that cost of product sales will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods  cost of product sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to decrease in if sales and production volumes increase 
research  development  regulatory and clinical expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in research  development  regulatory and clinical expenses are primarily comprised of salary and benefits  costs incurred in protecting the company s intellectual property and an allocated portion of overhead expenses 
the increase in represents the additional development funding and clinical expenses related to the enabl system and the development of the one step  reposable step and mini step access devices 
the decrease in reflects the completion or discontinuation of development programs  including costs associated with development  clinical trials and regulatory submission of a device using the company s gas exchange and blood pumping technologies 
the company anticipates that research  development  regulatory and clinical expenditures are likely to increase in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in sales and marketing expenses are primarily comprised of salary  benefits and commissions  an allocated portion of overhead expenses  advertising  promotional and customer service expenses and cost of product samples 
the increase reflects the expansion of sales and marketing functions for mis products as sales volumes increased in and  and as the company assembled its sales force of direct and independent representatives and international distributors following the initial commercialization of its mis products in the fourth quarter of the expenses in included compensation to sales representatives  costs of sample and demonstration product  costs to complete outcomes studies  costs of promotional and advertising programs and costs associated with establishing international distributors 
innerdyne expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salary and benefits  an allocated portion of overhead expenses  as well as legal  accounting  insurance and other general corporate expenses

interest expense was  in   in and  in this interest expense was primarily the result of debt and capital leases incurred to finance equipment to support operations of the company  in addition to interest incurred in related to loans to imi from its stockholders 
primarily for the reasons outlined above  innerdyne incurred net losses of  or 
in   or 
per share in and  or 
per share in management believes that the company is likely to incur operating losses at least through liquidity and capital resources from its inception to december   the company has incurred an accumulative deficit of approximately million 
since inception  the company s cash expenditures have exceeded its revenues 
prior to  the company was funded primarily through private placements of equity securities 
in  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at per share  which raised approximately million net of underwriter s discounts and offering expenses 
the acquisition of innerdyne medical  inc was accomplished through the issuance of additional common stock of the company 
in june  the company closed a private placement of  shares of the company s common stock and warrants to purchase  additional shares of common stock  with gross proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in march and april of  holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock exercised such warrants  resulting in gross proceeds to the company of  the company concluded a public offering on may   with the sale of  shares of common stock at per share  which raised  net of underwriters and issuance expenses

working capital totaled  at december   and the company had long term debt  excluding current installments  totaling  relating to financing of equipment 
in february  the company renewed its credit facility with silicon valley bank 
subject to certain covenants and conditions  the company may borrow up to  on a revolving credit basis at prime plus and  as a month term loan at prime plus 
the revolving credit portion of the facility is available based on the existence and magnitude of eligible receivables  and the term loan portion of the facility is available based on eligible equipment purchases 
as of december   the company had borrowed  under the previous agreement with silicon valley bank  and as of december  had borrowed an additional  under the current agreement for the financing of capital expenditures and  under the revolving credit facility for financing of working capital needs 
in the future  the company expects to incur substantial additional operating losses and cash outflow requirements as a result of expenditures related to expansion of sales and marketing capability  expansion of manufacturing capacity  research and development activities  compliance with regulatory requirements  and possible investment in or acquisition of additional complementary products  technologies or businesses 
the timing and amounts of these expenditures will depend upon many factors  such as the availability of capital  progress of the company s research and development  and factors that may be beyond the company s control  such as the results of product trials  the requirements for and the time required to obtain regulatory approval for existing products and any other products that may be developed or acquired  and market acceptance of the company s products 
the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance and demand for its products  the resources the company devotes to the development  manufacture and marketing of its products  the progress of the company s clinical research and product development programs  the receipt of  and the time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  the resources required to protect the company s intellectual property  and other factors 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be accurately predicted 
funds may also be used for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to those of the company 
consequently  although the company believes that the proceeds of the public offering of shares of its common stock completed in may  together with revenues  credit facilities and other sources of liquidity  will provide adequate funding for its capital requirements through at least  the company may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding or that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
any additional equity financings may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants
