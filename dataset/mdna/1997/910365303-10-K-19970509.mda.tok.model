impact of inflation whether current selling prices will be maintained or future selling price increases will be sufficient to match any future cost increases is not determinable at the present time due to the highly competitive conditions which exist in the food industry 
results of operations overview and trends the company s product line is made up of agricultural products which are subject to the cyclical conditions and risks inherent in the agricultural industry 
the company bears part of the growing risks and all of the processing and marketing risks of these agricultural products 
weather abnormalities and excess inventories sometimes cause substantial reductions in the annual volume of product processed in the company s facilities 
when this happens  the unit cost of that year s production will increase substantially  resulting in reduced profit margins for one or more years 
on the other hand  when bumper crops occur unit costs will decrease but selling prices will  in general  be depressed 
the company has always been faced with very strong competition in the marketplace from large brand name competitors  private regional us vegetable processors  and privately owned mexican vegetable processors 
these competitive pressures  coupled with low overall growth  have led to weak market pricing 
the company anticipates that this condition will continue for several years 
in addition to general inflation and the growing  processing and marketing risks described above  the company is facing the significant costs associated with increasing governmental regulation  the loss of land and water available for agriculture in california and the increasing competition due to world wide facilitation of trade 
as a result of these factors  the company s earnings history is cyclical and will continue to be so in the future 
the effect on the company s operations and its ability to withstand the costs of developing healthcare  labeling  osha  epa  taxation and other governmental regulations is unknown
