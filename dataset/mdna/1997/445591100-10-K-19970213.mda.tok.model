item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain of the information set forth below and elsewhere in this report contains forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
financial condition the company s working capital decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal due largely to the company s repurchases of its common shares discussed below 
the debt capitalization percentage increased to approximately at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal as a net result of the company s first quarter repurchases of an aggregate of  of its common shares and related debt incurred to finance the repurchases 
net cash flow of million  provided by operating activities in fiscal combined with available cash balances  were more than sufficient to fund a portion of the common stock repurchases approximately million  to repay a portion of long term debt million  to purchase property  plant  and equipment of million and to pay cash dividends of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company repurchased an aggregate of  of its common shares in a private transaction and a subsequent tender offer 
the price of the common shares acquired in the private transaction and tender offer  including related expenses  aggregated approximately million 
the company also obtained a new five year million credit facility  of which million was used to finance the aforementioned repurchases 
this new credit facility replaced the revolving credit agreements which were in effect at the end of fiscal see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements herein 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company refinanced million of its million floating rate credit facility through a private placement of senior notes to various insurance companies see note to consolidated financial statements herein 
this refinancing has provided the company with long term capital at a fixed rate and cash flow flexibility that allows for continued growth through both internal investment and possible strategic acquisitions 
the return on equity computed on a month rolling average before special charges and an accounting change discussed below improved to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the company s current assets decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal  primarily as a result of a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents  attributable  in part  to the uses of cash mentioned above 
accounts receivable increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at fiscal year end largely due to higher sales in the last month of fiscal compared to those at the end of fiscal and to a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal as a result of improved collections 
the decrease in inventories from million at fiscal year end to million at the end of fiscal was principally attributable to improved manufacturing processes 
current liabilities of million at the end of fiscal increased from million at the end of fiscal largely due to a million increase in accounts payable  which was primarily due to timing of and payment for raw materials received near the end of the fiscal year 
other noncurrent liabilities increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal due to several factors  including increases in pension liability and accrued incentive compensation for the new chief executive officer hired on june   partially offset by payments associated with the provision for special charges discussed below 
the increase in noncurrent deferred income taxes was due largely to excess tax depreciation over book depreciation 
the effect of favorable currency exchange rates for the british pound sterling the functional currency of the company s uk operations was the principal cause for a million increase in the cumulative translation adjustment account in stockholders equity 
at december   the company had a revolving credit facility and a line of credit with several banks  providing for borrowing capacity totaling million 
there were borrowings of million under these credit arrangements at december  management believes that funds generated from operations  combined with the existing credit facility  will be sufficient to meet currently anticipated working capital and other capital and debt service requirements see note to consolidated financial statements herein 
should the company require additional funds  management believes that the company could obtain them at competitive costs 
recent developments the company is currently undergoing  with the assistance of an outside consulting firm  an intensive strategic assessment of its various business segments and markets  the purpose of which is to assist the company in promptly developing and implementing a strategic plan for the operation and direction of the company 
management anticipates that it will take the balance of the fiscal year to complete this implementation plan and anticipates incurring charges associated with this plan during fiscal obviously  there are risks inherent in the implementation of any major strategic change  but management believes that the result will be a faster growing  more profitable and forward looking company 
as part of this strategic assessment  in january  the company reached agreements in principle to sell its lit ning products business and its hunt data products mediamate and calise brand products 
the sale of both businesses  which are subject to typical conditions  are expected to be completed during the first quarter of the combined net sales for these business units were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively  which are included under the office products business segment 
the divestiture of these businesses is not expected to result in a material gain or loss but will allow the company to focus on its core office products and art craft businesses
