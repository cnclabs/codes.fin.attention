the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  sii make loans that are typically in the form of secured debt with relatively high fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase equity securities of the borrower 
in addition to interest on investments  the company and sii also typically collect an up front processing fee on each loan they originate 
harris williams  another wholly owned subsidiary of the company  typically obtains a monthly retainer fee in each transaction for which it is retained and  in addition  a success fee when the transaction is consummated 
results of operations the company s financial performance in the statements of operations is composed of four primary elements 
the first is net operating income  which is the difference between the company s income from interest  dividends  fees and harris williams pretax income  and its total operating expenses  including interest expense 
the second element is realized gain loss on investments  which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets and their stated costs 
the third element is the change in unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments  which is the net change in the fair values of the company s portfolio assets compared with their fair values at the beginning of the period or their stated costs  as appropriate 
generally  realized gain loss on investments and change in unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments are inversely related in that when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in unrealized appreciation occurs since the gain associated with the asset is transferred from the unrealized category to the realized category 
conversely  when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes an increase in unrealized appreciation and an increase in realized loss 
the fourth element is provision for income taxes  which primarily consists of taxes owed on retained capital gains and taxes on the pretax income of harris williams

at december   the company s investment portfolio included investments in stocks and warrants of publicly traded companies that had an ascertainable market value and were being carried at a fair value of approximately million and represent an additional source of liquidity 
however  the company s ability to realize such values on a short term basis is limited by market conditions and various securities law restrictions 
traditionally  the company s principal sources of capital to fund its portfolio growth have been borrowings through the sba sponsored sbic debenture program  sales of the company s equity securities  both privately and publicly  and funds borrowed from banking institutions 
in february  the company consummated an initial public offering of  shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of million 
in august  the company consummated a second public offering of  shares of common stock generating net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in june  the company consummated a third public offering of  shares of common stock generating net proceeds of million 
the company used the proceeds of these offerings to originate new loans 
at december   total sba borrowings were million  the maximum amount of sba loans available to an sbic 
each borrowing from the sba has a term of ten years  is secured by the assets of sii  is guaranteed by the company and can be prepaid without penalty after five years 
the average interest rate on these borrowings was as of december   and none of these borrowings mature prior to as of december   sii had million outstanding under its million revolving credit facility with first union national bank and a syndicate of other banks the revolving credit facility  which is secured by all of sii s assets and by a pledge by the company to the lenders under the revolving credit facility of sii s stock and which is also guaranteed by the company 
the interest rate on these borrowings was at december  in order to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rate provided for under the revolving credit facility  sii has entered into various hedging arrangements 
the revolving credit facility matures on may  the revolving credit facility requires that sii obtain the lenders consent prior to  among other things  encumbering its assets  merging or consolidating with another entity and making investments other than those permitted by the sba 
in addition  the revolving credit facility provides that the repayment of any amounts outstanding can be accelerated if either george m 
miller  ii or david m 
resha ceases to be employed by the company 
to support the company s future loan origination activities outside of sii  the company has also established a million five year revolving credit facility the ing credit facility with holland limited securitization  inc  a multi seller commercial paper conduit sponsored by ing baring us capital markets  inc collectively ing 
sirrom funding corporation sfc  a wholly owned special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiary of the company  is the borrower under the ing credit facility 
sfc will purchase loans originated by the company and the related warrants and use these loans and warrants as collateral to secure borrowings from ing 
sfc is generally able to borrow up to of the principal amount of conforming loans collateralizing the ing credit facility 
as of january   the company made an initial capital contribution to sfc of approximately million of loans  which loans will serve as initial collateral for the ing credit facility

the ing credit facility matures on december  the ing credit facility is not guaranteed by the company 
however  certain actions by the company can trigger an event of default under the ing credit facility  which will result in termination of further funding thereunder and the application of the collateral pledged for repayment of the amounts outstanding thereunder 
in addition  the ing credit facility provides that an event of default is triggered if any two of george m 
miller  ii  david m 
resha and carl w 
stratton are no longer employed by the company 
the company believes that the million raised in the february public offering  anticipated borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the ing credit facility  together with cash on hand  loan repayments and cash flow from operations after distributions to shareholders  will be adequate to fund the continuing growth of the company s investment portfolio through the first half of in order to provide the funds necessary for the company to continue its growth strategy beyond that period  the company expects to incur  from time to time  additional short and long term borrowings from other sources  and to issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities 
the availability and terms of any such borrowings will depend upon interest rate  market and other conditions 
there can be no assurances that such additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to the company
