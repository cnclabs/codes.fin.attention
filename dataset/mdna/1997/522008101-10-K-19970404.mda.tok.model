reference is made to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and on which the following table is based 
years ended december  revenues    operating income loss    net income loss    net income loss per share fully diluted operating income loss includes amortization and merger related charges related to acquisitions of   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenues revenues by distribution channel for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended year ended december  of total december  of total distribution channel revenues revenues retail   oem   school  direct response   international   tax software and services   total revenues increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to several factors  including the effect of revenues from the acquisitions of the former learning company  compton s and mecc and an increase in sales of new and upgraded products launched by the company during the year 
retail revenues increased as a result of the acquisitions of the former learning company  compton s and mecc plus a general increase in sales of consumer software products through retailers such as wal mart  office depot  k mart and officemax and sales from new and upgraded products 
international sales increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of edusoft in  a full year of sales from tewi which was acquired in july and an increase in the number of translated foreign language versions of the company s products available for sale in the international markets 
original equipment manufacturer oem revenues increased due to the availability of new product offerings for this channel and an increased demand for multi language titles 
direct response revenues increased on a dollar basis but decreased as a percentage of revenues due to the overall increase in revenues resulting from product sales of the acquired companies  which did not formerly participate in the direct response channel 
direct response revenues also increased as a result of the introduction of an outbound telephone sales program during prior to the acquisitions of the former learning company and mecc  the company did not participate in the school channel 
revenues from tax software and services increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of earlier delivery of product to the company s customers 
the company expects that its future revenue growth will depend on  among other things  its ability to introduce new and upgraded products to the marketplace  the extent of competition  unit pricing trends  the rate of proliferation of personal computers into the home market and the demand for its consumer software products along with the company s respective share in the consumer software market 
unit pricing will be affected by the extent of competition in the consumer software industry  which is expected to increase 
in addition  the company s ability to develop products for new platforms and introduce titles into new distribution channels will impact future revenues and growth rates 
the consumer software industry has experienced continued consolidation of formerly independent companies 
to the extent that these companies gain greater market share than the company  future results will be affected negatively 
during  the company experienced lower dollar and unit market share in the retail consumer software market in the united states as compared to the prior year 
the company believes that this combined company loss of market share is due primarily to the entrance of large competitors with well known brands such as disney and mattel and due to the success of a certain number of its competitors strategies to introduce lower priced offerings and reduce current pricing 
as a result of this increased competition the company s future revenues and market share may be adversely effected 
costs and expenses the company s costs and expenses and the respective percentages of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are as follows year ended year ended december  of total december  of total revenues revenues costs of production   sales and marketing   general and administrative   research and development   amortization and merger related charges   total costs and expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in the year ended december   as compared with in the year ended december  this increase as a percentage of revenues was caused primarily by the charges for incomplete technology  the amortization of goodwill and acquired technology resulting from the acquisitions of the former learning company  compton s and mecc  offset by the reduction in general and administrative costs  sales and marketing costs and costs of production as a percentage of revenues as a result of the integration and centralization of the operations of the acquired companies 
costs of production includes the cost of manuals  packaging  diskettes and cd rom disks  duplication  assembly and fulfillment charges 
in addition  costs of production includes royalties paid to third party developers and inventory obsolescence reserves 
costs of production  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  the decrease in costs of production as a percentage of revenues was caused by reduced prices on the cost to manufacture product due to increased unit volumes  changes in the production components  the impact from the former learning company and mecc having historically higher gross margin selling products than the company prior to the acquisitions 
in addition  during the company experienced an increase in revenues in the oem  school and direct response channels  all of which typically experience higher gross margins than the company s traditional retail box product sales channel 
as well  the company has seen an increase in sales of its value line of products  which  due to the nature of the low cost packaging in a jewel case  also generate higher gross margins 
the company expects costs of production as a percentage of revenues to increase in the foreseeable future due to sales pricing pressure on its products by retailers 
in february  the company moved a substantial portion of its north american manufacturing operations from stream international inc  located in utah  to sonopress  inc and bmg distribution  units of bertelsmann ag  located in north carolina 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience transition difficulties in connection with this move  which in turn could result in higher costs of production and shipping delays to customers 
if the company experiences higher costs of production and shipping delays  its results of operations may be adversely affected 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to of revenues in the year ended december  as compared to of revenues in the year ended december  the percentage decrease was a result of the company reducing both fixed costs and employee headcount of its combined operations following the acquisitions in late and may general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  this is primarily the result of a general reduction in overhead costs and employee headcount following the acquisitions in and research and development expenses increased to of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  the increase is a result of a higher proportion of internally developed products from the former learning company  compton s and mecc than developed by the company prior to these acquisitions 
the company expects that as technologies become more complex it will continue to spend an increasing percentage of its revenues on research and development 
amortization and merger related charges increased to of revenues in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  the increase results from the amortization of the goodwill and acquired technology arising on the acquisitions of the former learning company and compton s for a full year in the year ended december  as compared to less than a month in the year ended december   and from the amortization of goodwill and acquired technology and the charge for incomplete technology arising from the acquisition of mecc in may amortization and merger related charges are as follows years ended december  amortization of goodwill and other assets   amortization of acquired technology   charge for incomplete technology   employee severance costs   provision for earn outs  professional fees and other transaction related costs   other   provision for litigation  the increase in amortization of goodwill and other assets in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  relates primarily to the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of mecc in may and a full year of amortization of goodwill arising from the former learning company and compton s  which were acquired in december goodwill is primarily being amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
the increase in amortization of technology and of product related costs in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  relates to the amortization of acquired technology in connection with the acquisition of mecc in may and a full year of amortization of technology and product related costs arising from the former learning company and compton s  which were acquired in december the charge for incomplete technology for the year ended december  relates to products being developed by mecc and in the year ended december  for products developed by the former learning company and compton s which the company believes had not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition and for which additional development was required to complete the software technology and products 
employee severance costs in each year related to severance paid to employees of the company terminated in connection with the acquisitions 
the provision for earn outs relates to additional payments which may be earned by the former owners of certain international acquisitions purchased in and the earn out requirements are based upon meeting certain financial and other goals and will be recorded when those conditions are met 
professional fees decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to decreased charges related to the investment banking  legal and accounting costs 
interest income expense interest income expense increased to a net expense of  in the year ended december  as compared to net income of in as a result of increased interest expense arising from the senior convertible notes issued by the company in results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenues revenues by distribution channel for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended year ended december  of total december  of total distribution channel revenues revenues retail   oem   catalog  direct response   international   tax software and services   lansa software  total revenues increased by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to general growth in the consumer software market and the expansion of market share by the company through various acquisitions and new product offerings 
retail revenues increased by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the foregoing as well as an increase in the number of north american retail outlets selling the company s products from approximately  to  an increase in the number of products available for sale and an increase in the sales of the company s platinum jewel case only line of products  which was launched in december oem sales increased by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the acquisition of future vision which had a strong presence and sales network in the oem channel 
direct response sales increased by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the number of mailings completed by the company during the year 
the company s international revenues increased by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was driven by both the acquisition of tewi  a german software company  on july  and increased penetration of personal computers in europe  which in turn caused an increase in demand for and sales of consumer software products 
tax software and services revenues were relatively constant on a year over year basis due to increasing competition and the saturation of the tax software market in canada 
during  the company closed its catalog operations and sold its lansa software operations 
costs and expenses the company s costs and expenses and the respective percentages of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are as follows year ended year ended december  of total december  of total revenues revenues costs of production   sales and marketing   general and administrative   research and development   amortization and merger related charges   costs of production are comprised of  among other things  the cost of product documentation  packaging and disks 
other items included in costs of production are royalties to third party developers and reserves for obsolete inventory 
costs of production as a percentage of revenues increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  costs of production increased in the year ended december  primarily due to the acquisition of tewi  which operates at a higher costs of production due to the distribution element of its revenue base 
this increase was somewhat offset by lower costs of production caused by improved manufacturing costs in north america  which primarily relate to the lower cost of purchasing cd roms and a greater proportion of business on cd rom as compared to magnetic disk 
sales and marketing expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to a higher proportion of the company s revenues arising from its international and direct response distribution channels 
each of these distribution channels have higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues than the other distribution channels of the company 
general and administrative expenses were lower on a percentage of revenues basis in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   but are relatively consistent with the prior year in absolute dollar amounts due to flat employee head count 
amortization and merger related charges increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  the increase is related to the amortization and merger related charges associated with the acquisitions of the former learning company  compton s  tewi and future vision  among others  during the year ended december  and certain charges associated with the merger with mecc 
amortization and merger related charges are as follows years ended december  charge for incomplete technology  amortization of goodwill and other assets   amortization of technology and product related costs  professional fees and transaction related costs  other  the charge for incomplete technology relates to products being developed by the former learning company and compton s which the company believes had not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition and for which additional development was required to complete the software technology and products 
the increase in amortization of goodwill and other assets relates primarily to the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of the former learning company  compton s and tewi and a full year s amortization of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of software marketing corporation  which was acquired in september goodwill is primarily being amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
the increase in amortization of technology and of product related costs in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  relates to the amortization of completed technology and products acquired in connection with the acquisitions of the former learning company and compton s plus increased amortization of product development costs related to products acquired in connection with the merger with future vision during the year 
professional fees increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to charges related to the investment banking  legal and accounting costs incurred through year end for the merger with mecc and the professional fees associated with the acquisition of future vision on august  approximately  of these costs remained to be paid at december  the remainder was paid prior to december  professional fees in were for investment banking  accounting and legal fees incurred in connection with the acquisitions of aris multimedia entertainment  inc and compact publishing  inc 
these costs have been paid 
the other costs relate primarily to the consolidation of the acquired facilities and related work force reductions and litigation costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to  at december  from  at december  this increase was attributable to the cash provided by general operations  cash received from the acquisition of mecc of  and proceeds from stock option exercises and other stock related transactions of  offset by the repayment of approximately  of merger related liabilities  repurchase of senior convertible notes of  and purchases of equipment for  during the year ended december  the company paid  of amounts due to the stockholders of the former learning company as the remaining purchase price due from the acquisition in and drew  on its line of credit 
during the year ended december  the company generated cash from operations of  as of february   the company has outstanding  principal amount senior convertible notes due the senior convertible notes and  principal amount senior convertible exchangeable notes due held by the tribune company the tribune notes 
the senior convertible notes and tribune notes will be redeemable by the company on or after november  at declining redemption prices 
should the senior convertible notes and the tribune notes not convert under their terms into common stock  there can be no assurances that the company will have sufficient cash flows from future operations to meet payment requirements under the debt or be able to re finance the notes under favorable terms or at all 
on august   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase by the company over the next twelve months of up to million principal amount of its senior convertible notes from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions 
any purchases would depend on price  market conditions and other factors 
during the year ended december  senior convertible notes declined by  through repurchases 
in march  the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase by the company of up to million shares of its common stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated transactions 
any purchases would depend on price  market conditions and other factors 
the company also has in place a revolving line of credit the line with a bank  to provide for a maximum availability of  borrowings under the line become due on july  and bear interest at the prime rate at december  
the line is subject to certain financial covenants  is secured by a general security interest in certain operating subsidiaries of the company and by a pledge of the stock of certain of its subsidiaries 
the line is guaranteed by the company 
there was  drawn on the line at december   which has been subsequently repaid 
income generated by the company s subsidiaries in certain foreign countries cannot be repatriated to the company in the united states without payment of additional taxes since the company does not currently receive a us tax credit with respect to income taxes paid by the company including its subsidiaries in those foreign countries 
the company also conducts its tax software business in canada  which has experienced foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation relative to the us dollar 
at the present time  the company expects that its cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next twelve months 
longer term cash requirements are dictated by a number of external factors  which include the company s ability to launch new and competitive products  the strength of competition in the consumer software industry and the growth of the home computer market 
in addition  the company s senior convertible notes and tribune notes mature in the year if not converted to common stock  the company may be required to secure alternative financing sources 
there can be no assurance that alternative financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to the company in the future or at all 
the company continuously evaluates products and technologies for acquisitions  however no estimation of short term or long term cash requirements for such acquisitions can be made at this time 
future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that is subject to many risks and uncertainties 
some of the important risks and uncertainties which may cause the company s operating results to differ materially or adversely are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
intense competitive environment the consumer software industry is intensely and increasingly competitive and is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the company competes for retail shelf space and general consumer awareness with a number of companies that market consumer software 
the company encounters competition from both established companies  including the largest companies in the industry  and new companies that may develop comparable or superior products 
a number of the company s competitors and potential competitors possess significantly greater capital  marketing resources and brand recognition than the company 
rapid changes in technology  product obsolescence and advances in computer software and hardware require the company to develop or acquire new products and to enhance its existing products on a timely basis 
the company s marketplace has recently experienced a higher emphasis on on line and internet related services and content tailored for this new delivery vehicle 
to the extent that demand increases for on line products and content  the demand for the company s existing products may change 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully maintain market share and otherwise compete successfully in the future 
competitive pressures in the software industry have resulted  and the company believes are likely to continue to result  in pressure to reduce the prices of its products or risk loss of market share 
in response to such competitive pressures the company has reduced the price of certain of its educational products 
there can be no assurance that company s product prices will not continue to decline in the future or that the company will not respond to such declines with additional price reductions 
such price reductions may reduce the company s revenues and operating margins in the future 
large companies with substantial bases of intellectual property content in the motion picture and media industries  sophisticated product marketing and technical abilities and or financial resources that may not need to realize an immediate profit or return on investment have increasingly entered or announced their intention to enter the consumer software market 
these competitors include microsoft  disney  mattel  hasbro and cuc international inc for example  technology companies have begun to acquire greater access to content  and content oriented companies have begun to acquire greater technological capabilities 
to the extent that competitors achieve a performance  price or distribution advantage  the company could be adversely affected 
furthermore  increased consolidation of the consumer software market may impact future growth potential and performance 
in the retail distribution channel resellers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources 
there is intense competition for high quality and adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support from retailers 
to the extent that the number of consumer computer platforms and products increases  this competition for shelf space may also increase 
the retail channel increasingly includes non traditional software retailers such as book  music  video  magazine  toy  gift  convenience  drug and grocery store chains 
mass merchants such as wal mart and k mart are increasingly becoming a larger portion of the company s sales 
as these retailers achieve greater market share from the traditional software retailers  the company may experience higher marketing costs and increased competition for shelf space  which could impact future sales and operating margins 
additionally  as technology changes  the type and number of distribution channels will further change and new types of competitors  such as cable or telephone companies  are likely to emerge 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete effectively in these channels 
the retail channels of distribution available for products are subject to rapid changes as retailers and distributors enter and exit the consumer software market or alter their product inventory preferences 
other types of retail outlets and methods of product distribution may become important in the future 
these new methods may include delivery of software using on line services or the internet which will necessitate certain changes in the company s business and operations including addressing operational challenges such as improving download time for pictures  images and programs  ensuring proper regulation of content quality and developing sophisticated security for transmitting payments 
should on line distribution channels increase  the company will be required to modify its existing technology platforms in order for its products to be compatible and remain competitive 
it is critical to the success of the company that  as these changes occur  it maintain access to those channels of distribution offering software in its market segments 
new products and rapid technological change the company operates in a highly competitive and technology driven environment 
the consumer software industry is undergoing substantial change and is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
software companies must continue to develop or acquire new products or upgrade existing products on a timely basis to sustain revenues and profitable operations 
factors contributing to the short life span of pc software have included rapid technological change and an expanded demand for content rich products 
software companies must continue to create or acquire innovative new products reflecting technological changes in hardware and software and translate current products into newly accepted hardware and software formats  in order to gain and maintain a viable market for their products 
pc hardware  in particular  is steadily advancing in power and function  expanding the market for increasingly complex and flexible software products 
this has also resulted in longer periods necessary for research and development of new products and a greater degree of unpredictability in the time necessary to develop products 
furthermore  the rapid changes in the market and the increasing number of new products available to consumers have increased the degree of consumer acceptance risk with respect to any specific title that the company may publish 
it is expected that this trend will continue and may become more pronounced in the future 
similarly  the company s recent product content focus and enhanced presence in the educational and reference software market have required and will continue to require the company to evaluate and adopt appropriate development and marketing strategies and methods  which may differ from those historically employed by the company and subject the company to the risks and competitive pressures associated with those new strategies 
the company s rights to license many of its software products are non exclusive and  generally  of limited duration  and there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to obtain new products from developers or to maintain or expand its market share in the event that a competitor offers the same or similar software products 
if the company is unable to develop or acquire new products in a timely manner as revenues decrease from products reaching the end of their natural life cycle  the company s results of operations will be adversely affected 
dependence on major supplier in  the production  assembly and distribution of the company s north american budget  jewel case only line of products was performed by two units of bertelsmann ag collectively  bmg  and the production  assembly and distribution of the company s other north american products  with certain exceptions including duplication of cd rom disks  school and oem products  was performed by stream international  inc in february  bmg began to provide substantially all duplication  assembly and fulfillment of the company s north american products  other than school products 
while the company believes that its expanded relationship with bmg will result in greater manufacturing and fulfillment efficiency  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties or delays in the manufacture and fulfillment as a result of the transition of those functions 
the company believes that its existing production capacity is sufficient to handle anticipated increases in volume and titles into the foreseeable future 
although the company believes that suitable alternative suppliers exist  there can be no assurance that any termination or modification of its arrangement with bmg would not result in a short term business interruption for the company 
effect of new accounting pronouncement the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  earnings per share  which modifies the way in which earnings per share eps is calculated and disclosed 
currently  the company discloses primary and fully diluted eps 
upon adoption of this standard for the fiscal year ending december   the company will disclose basic and diluted eps for fiscal and will restate all prior period eps data presented 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for this period 
diluted eps  similar to fully diluted eps  reflects the potential that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shares in the earnings of the entity 
management believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on reported earnings per share
