item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following is a discussion of material changes in the consolidated results of operations of the company for the years ended december  and and pro forma statements for the year ended december  see item  unaudited pro forma financial statements and notes to unaudited pro forma financial statements 
the company provides marketing  administration  and risk management services and solutions for benefit programs 
the company s customers include managed care organizations  insurance companies  integrated health care delivery systems  self funded benefit plans  and health care purchasing alliances 
factors affecting profitability the company s profitability depends on its customers service requirements  its ability to meet these requirements efficiently  and the methods of determining compensation for the company s services 
the factors affecting service requirements and compensation levels vary depending on the business unit 
service requirements in both the small group and large group businesses  the company offers claims payment services  but such services are typically part of the monthly fee charged  as opposed to a function of the volume of claims filed 
thus  on the operating side  profitability is heavily reliant on both the volume of claims filed and the efficiency with which the company processes claims 
the same principle applies to the company s other support functions  such as enrollment  billing  underwriting  customer service  and reporting 
in the future  the company s efficiency as an administrator of health care benefits will be influenced by its ability to increase the use of electronic data interchange edi in the claims collection and input function and its ability to expand the use of auto adjudication in the claims processing and payment function 
profitability also will be influenced by the company s ability to increase operational efficiencies through consolidation of plants and maximization of economies of scale 
compensation in the small group business  the company is usually compensated by way of a percentage of premium collected sometimes referred to as premium retention percentage  and in some instances the company charges the covered group a fixed monthly fee 
premium collected is a function of the premium charged by the payor on each life in the group 
thus  profitability can be a function of many factors  including the number of groups in force  the number of lives in force  the number of lives per group  the related premium retention percentage  and the overall volume of premium collected on a monthly basis 
the company s ability to increase lives or groups in force is influenced by new business generated and cases retained 
the success of both is heavily influenced by the competitive nature of the pricing offered by the payor and its desire to maintain a presence in its geographic regions and the small group market in general 
the company believes that a higher percentage of future small group revenue will be derived from hmo versus traditional indemnity business  and premium retention percentages are typically lower from hmo business 
in addition  it is possible that competitive pressures or regulatory reform could lower future premium retention percentages on the company s indemnity products 
the company s premium retention percentage declined from almost in january to approximately in february thus  the company will have to increase sales volume in the future to maintain the same operating margins 
in the large group and alliance businesses  the company is typically compensated on a capitated or per member  per month pmpm basis 
this rate is usually the result of a competitive bidding process  and pricing is typically fixed for a period of time 
future profitability will be influenced by the company s ability to create value added services that allow it to deviate from the commodity pricing inherent in the bidding process 
special risks associated with the alliance business starting in  the company pursued contracts with state sponsored health care purchasing alliances  initially in florida  and in  with additional contracts in north carolina  kentucky  and washington 
the company has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the start up of these contracts  and  to date  the alliance business has been unprofitable 
the primary material risks associated with alliance contracts are private enterprises will not accept the use of a government sponsored program and will therefore fail to provide an adequate number of enrollees to support a revenue base over which fixed costs may be spread 
the number of enrollees per group will be so low that margins are insufficient to cover the fixed costs of set up for the group 
the level of marketing  enrollment  and customer service required will be materially higher than expected  thereby increasing the variable costs required under the contract 
the independent agents on whom the company relies to distribute the product will not be enthusiastic about the alliance program  resulting in lower than expected enrollment 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recoup its investment in developing its alliance relationships or that these operations will ultimately be profitable 
factors affecting growth the company s growth is affected greatly by its acquisitions of other administrators 
growth through acquisition involves substantial risks  including the risk of improper valuation of the acquired business 
in addition  the value of such an acquired business or block of business could be impaired if the company is not successful in integrating the business into its existing operations 
these risks are increased when the company elects to make such acquisitions on a leveraged basis 
to understand how the company books acquisitions of administrators in purchase transactions  an understanding of the unique nature of the business is essential 
because administrators can operate with a minimal amount of capital  acquired companies typically have modest tangible asset bases 
as evidenced by the company s recent experiences at harrington and consolidated group  other than the underlying business  there are no intangible long lived assets such as work force  customer base  or supplier relationships to which the company could assign significant value  as these are relationships that routinely turn over and are replaced in the ordinary course of business 
often  no single customer of an acquired business constitutes a significant part of the business  and customers typically have annual contracts which may or may not be renewed 
renewal rates can vary significantly on an annual basis 
accordingly  values cannot be assigned to individual customers or contracts 
thus  goodwill  which is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  is often a significant portion of the purchase price 
after performing a review for impairment of goodwill related to each of the company s acquired businesses and applying the principles of measurement contained in fasb  the company recorded a pre tax charge against earnings of million in the third quarter of  representing approximately of the company s pre charge goodwill 
the pre tax charge is attributable to impairment of goodwill recorded on the following acquisitions dgb  million  and tpcm  million 
at the time of the dgb acquisition  the company projected a to growth rate in net cash flows at dgb and paid a purchase price which resulted in million of goodwill 
since this acquisition  the dgb business has not achieved  and does not expect to achieve  the revenue and net cash flow projections prepared at the time of the acquisition due to  among other things  higher than originally expected attrition rates resulting in ongoing decreases in net revenues due in part to increased pricing resulting from a reinsurance carrier s departure from dgb s market and an inadequate distribution system  as evidenced by an underperforming sales force and greater than anticipated operating costs 
the company s efforts to correct these deficiencies have not enabled it to meet its original projections 
the company has determined that its revised projected cash flows will not fully provide for the recovery of the goodwill balance of million 
accordingly  the company has written off million of goodwill associated with the dgb acquisition 
any further significant declines in dgb s projected net cash flows may result in additional write downs of remaining goodwill 
at the time of the tpcm acquisition  the company projected a to growth rate in net cash flows at tpcm and paid a purchase price which resulted in million of goodwill 
since this acquisition  tpcm has not achieved  and does not expect to achieve  the revenue and net cash flow projections prepared at the time of the acquisition due to  among other things  higher than originally expected attrition rates  significantly higher than expected claims experience claims filed per enrollee  and greater than anticipated operating costs due to the inability to obtain economies of scale through integration 
the company s efforts to correct these deficiencies have not enabled it to meet its original projections 
lives covered at tpcm decreased by  during the company has determined that its revised projected cash flows will not fully provide for the recovery of the goodwill balance of million 
accordingly  the company has written off million of goodwill associated with the tpcm acquisition 
any further significant declines in tpcm s projected net cash flows may result in additional write downs of remaining goodwill 
the company anticipates reductions in revenue at tpcm and dgb of approximately and  respectively  in tpcm and dgb represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter of the company continually evaluates these operations for opportunities to reverse these revenue losses and adjust operating costs in response to changing conditions and does not believe these operations will create any further materially adverse impact on future results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully and profitably integrate the businesses of harrington and consolidated group into its existing operations 
in addition  certain costs will be incurred to successfully integrate these acquired companies 
although harrington and consolidated group are significantly larger companies with a broader customer base over which to spread risk  more infrastructure  and longer histories of servicing customers  and management remains optimistic about the future  there can be no assurance that adverse renewals will not occur in the future 
the company will continue to evaluate on a regular basis whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
although the net unamortized balance of goodwill is not considered to be impaired  any such future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized goodwill could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
subsequent to the acquisitions of harrington and consolidated group  the company now serves approximately  businesses  plan holders  and governmental agencies in states  washington  dc  and puerto rico  covering approximately million members 
reliance on payors typically  the company s insurance and managed care payors sign contracts with the company that are cancelable by either party without penalty upon advance written notice of between days and one year and are also cancelable upon a significant change of ownership of the company 
the new england  celtic life insurance company  and ameritas life insurance corporation businesses accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenue in and approximately   and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenue for the year ended december  although this decline is due primarily to the company s expansion through acquisition  which has diluted its concentration of revenues from these sources  it should be noted that the company continues to experience higher lapses than originations in the business written with these payors  and it is not certain when  if ever  this trend will be reversed 
in the third quarter of  metropolitan life insurance company completed a merger with the new england 
the company is unable to predict what effect  if any  such merger will ultimately have on the company s relationship with the new england 
historically  the majority of consolidated group s business was written with the travelers insurance company  which recently combined with the health insurance business of metropolitan life insurance company to form metrahealth 
subsequently  metrahealth was acquired by united healthcare  one of the nation s leading hmo companies 
between july  and december   this business represented approximately of consolidated group s revenue  or approximately of the company s consolidated revenue 
the company is dependent on united healthcare s commitment to the small group market and on the company s ultimate success in converting the metrahealth business to united healthcare s new products 
should the company have to move this business to another payor  it could experience higher than normal lapse rates and lower than normal margins 
the abandonment of the small group market by either the new england  celtic life insurance company  or ameritas life insurance corporation  indemnity payors ability to manage medical losses  and the degree to which the company is successful in the metrahealth conversion  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to the business serviced by the company  a decision by any one of these payors to administer and distribute a significant portion of its products directly to small businesses also could have a material adverse effect on the company 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages which certain items of income and expense bear to the company s revenues for such periods 
company company pro forma year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  revenues expenses agent commissions personnel expenses general administrative expenses pre operating and contract start up costs contract commitments restructure charge integration expense loss on impairment of goodwill staff reductions and office closings depreciation amortization total expenses net loss income before interest expense interest expense loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income see unaudited pro forma financial statements and notes to unaudited pro forma financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from additional revenues of million  million  million  and million from the company s acquisitions of tpcm effective  dgb effective  consolidated group effective  and harrington effective  respectively 
revenues from healthplan services  inc hpsi large group and alliance customers increased million and million  respectively  over agent commissions expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from million of additional commissions related to the company s acquisitions of tpcm  dgb  consolidated group  and harrington 
hpsi s commissions as a percentage of operating revenues declined from in to in  as large group revenues represented a greater percentage of total hpsi revenues 
large group commissions of hpsi revenues represent a lower percentage of revenues than small group commissions of hpsi revenues 
if large group revenues continue to represent an increasingly greater percentage of overall consolidated revenues  agent commissions as a percentage of revenues are expected to continue to decline 
personnel expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  or  from million in of this increase  million is attributable to the company s acquisitions of tpcm  dgb  consolidated group  and harrington 
personnel expenses for hpsi increased million and are primarily related to additional salaries and wages  overtime  and temporary services related to new activity in hpsi s alliance and large group business units  which are more labor intensive than the small group business unit 
assuming the mix of activity in the company s business units is consistent with that of  ongoing personnel expenses as a percentage of revenues are not expected to change significantly 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in of this increase  million is attributable to costs associated with the company s acquisitions of tpcm  dgb  consolidated group  and harrington 
costs for hpsi increased by million and are primarily attributable to telephone  postage  printing  and professional services related to hpsi s new business activities in the alliance and large group business units 
contract commitment expenses relate to the recognition of losses on adverse contracts entered into by the company in previous periods with state sponsored health care purchasing alliances in florida and north carolina 
these losses are the result of lower than anticipated growth in lives per case and the resulting excess of cost of service over revenue to be earned over the balance of the applicable contract periods 
discussions have been ongoing with the related sponsors florida and north carolina to obtain revisions in contract terms sufficient to generate additional revenue or reduced costs 
during  the company was unable to obtain concessions sufficient to offset the adverse results expected on the florida and north carolina contracts  resulting in the recognition of a loss of million 
restructure charges result primarily from the company s closure of its memphis facility and downsizing of its corporate offices subsequent to the acquisitions of consolidated group and harrington 
the loss on partial impairment of goodwill reflects the write down of the carrying value of goodwill originally recorded upon the company s acquisition of tpcm and dgb  which reflects their expected future discounted cash flows see item  business recent transactions and company reorganization for related discussion 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in of this increase  million relates to depreciation and amortization on the company s acquisitions of tpcm  dgb  consolidated group  and harrington million of which is the amortization of goodwill on the acquisitions being calculated on a straight line basis over years 
an additional increase of million at hpsi is primarily attributable to the amortization of internally developed software for the company s alliance administration 
year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decline of million in revenues generated from services provided through the small group business unit 
declines in revenue from two of the company s payors accounted for million of this decrease  as such payors deemphasized their small group indemnity products and developed managed care products 
additionally  the loss of one payor relationship  the centennial life insurance company relationship which terminated effective january   resulted in a reduction in revenue of million 
the decline in small group revenue was partially offset by an increase in large group revenue of million resulting from the company s acquisitions and an increase in interest income of million primarily from earnings on the proceeds from the company s may  initial public offering 
agent commissions expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease resulted principally from the decline in revenues for the period 
agent commissions expense represented approximately of operating revenues for the year ended december  in 
as a percentage of revenues  small group agent commissions are significantly greater than large group agent commissions 
small group agent commissions represented approximately of related customer revenues in in  and large group agent commissions represented approximately of related customer revenues in in 
personnel expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease was primarily related to the termination of employees of the predecessor company on september   offset by million of additional personnel costs related to the company s acquisitions 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million in the company realized savings in telephone  rent  leased equipment  and consulting fees in  which were offset by million of additional expenses related to the company s acquisitions 
the company incurred million in pre operating and start up costs during the year ended december  these costs related primarily to the state sponsored health care purchasing alliances in kentucky and north carolina and consisted of salaries and wages and temporary help  printing  and travel expenses 
contract commitment expense of million for the year ended december  represented the excess of expected future costs over future revenues for the chpa contract term expiring in april depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted principally from an increase in depreciation related to the purchase of new telephone and computer hardware equipment and an increase in the amortization of goodwill related to the company s acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources on may   the company completed an initial public offering which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
on august   hps used approximately million of the offering proceeds to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of tpcm 
on october   hps used approximately million of the offering proceeds to acquire substantially all of the assets of the third party administration business of dgb 
the company placed an additional million of the proceeds in an escrow account to guarantee the availability of funds for semi monthly payments due with respect to the dgb acquisition 
on january   using offering proceeds  the company acquired million of preferred stock of medirisk  representing a ownership interest in medirisk  and on march   medirisk exercised its option to issue million of debt with detachable warrants to the company 
to date  the company has not elected to convert the detachable warrants into common stock of medirisk 
on january   medirisk completed an initial public offering of million shares of its common stock at a purchase price of per share  and medirisk subsequently fully satisfied its debt obligation to the company see notes to consolidated financial statements investments 
on july   the company utilized substantially all of the remaining funds originating from the public offering and borrowed against its line of credit under its may  credit facility with first union national bank of north carolina first union and other lenders line of credit to fund the acquisitions of harrington and consolidated group 
on september   the company increased its line of credit from million to million 
first union serves as agency bank with respect to this facility 
like the company s previous credit facility with first union  the new facility contains provisions which require the company to maintain certain minimum financial ratios  impose limitations on acquisition activity and capital spending  and which prohibit the company from declaring or paying any dividend upon any of its capital stock without the consent of first union 
during the third quarter of  the company amended the terms of its credit facility to allow it to spread the effects of the restructuring and integration costs recorded see notes to consolidated financial statements restructure and integration over three years for purposes of calculating funds availability on its line of credit 
similar treatment is in place for calculating compliance with financial covenants 
the outstanding draw against the line of credit was million at december  the company expects that the decline in cash flows which resulted in the recording of a million charge for the impairment of goodwill will not result in the company s inability to meet future operating  investing  and financing requirements for the near future  especially given that tpcm and dgb revenues represent approximately of total company revenue in the fourth quarter of cash flow  as measured by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  approximated  and million for the year ended december  for tpcm and dgb  respectively 
in addition  other than the decline in cash flow that led to the impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of  the company knows of no other effects or expected effects on the company s results of future operations or financial position 
the company believes that additional revenue will be provided by new products and sales generated by other initiatives of the company  which will offset the impact on its future operations and cash flows 
this statement is forward looking in nature  however  and actual results may differ if the company s initiatives are unsuccessful 
although only nine months have passed since the company s acquisitions of harrington and consolidated group  management does not foresee any immediate adverse circumstances similar to tpcm and dgb due to the significantly broader market base over which to spread risk and consolidated group s and harrington s longer history of servicing customers 
although management remains optimistic about the future  there can be no assurance that adverse business conditions will not occur in the future 
the company incurred a cash outlay of approximately million in for non recurring integration costs related primarily to systems integration and expects to incur an additional cash outlay of approximately million in based on current expectations  the company believes that all consolidated operating  investing  and financing activities for the foreseeable future will be met from internally generated cash flow from operations  available cash  or its existing line of credit
