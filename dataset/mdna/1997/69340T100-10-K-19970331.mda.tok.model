item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except as otherwise indicated  all references to  and refer to the fiscal year ended on december of those years respectively 
introduction basis of presentation 
effective february  pld telekom inc was continued as a delaware corporation and as a result the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the audited consolidated financial statements for prior years were prepared in accordance with canadian gaap  with a reconciliation to us gaap 
as a consequence of the continuance to delaware  the and financial statements have been restated in accordance with us gaap 
principal operations and future activities the company s key interests at december  include a equity interest in peterstar  which provides telecommunication services in st 
petersburg  russia  a equity interest in becet  which provides cellular services in kazakstan  and a equity interest in technocom which  through its equity interest in teleport tp  operates an international teleport in moscow  fiber optic networks in moscow and its environs and a satellite based long distance network across russia 
cable wireless is the company s principal shareholder at december  the consolidation of financial information in the financial statements differs from by reflecting i the company s acquisition of of the outstanding shares of bcl in april  and ii the acquisition by technocom of a controlling voting interest in teleport tp effective december the company s telecommunications businesses are developing rapidly in an emerging economy which  by its nature  has an uncertain economic  political and regulatory environment 
the general risks of operating businesses in the former soviet union include the possibility for rapid change in government policies  economic conditions  the tax regime and foreign currency regulations 
in addition  teleport s satellite based long distance network is at an early stage of its development and operations 
ultimate recoverability of the company s investments in peterstar  becet and teleport is dependent upon each of these subsidiaries achieving and maintaining profitability  which is dependent to a certain extent on the stabilization of the economies of the former soviet union  the ability to maintain the necessary telecommunications licenses and the ability to obtain adequate financing to meet capital commitments 
effect of change from canadian gaap to us gaap 
the effect of the restatement of prior year comparitives from canada to us gaap is explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the main differences may be summarized as follows i under canadian gaap  the convertible notes issued in connection with the june placement are a compound financial instrument and the debt and equity elements are separatly accounted for 
under u 
s gaap  the convertible notesare accounted for as a single debt instrument under the long term dept caption  and ii us gaap does not permit the capitalization of pre operating costs 
therefore  in anticipation of the change to us gaap  effective december  the compnay changed its canadian gaap policy with respect to pre operating costs bring it in line with us gaap 
as a result all such costs were retroactively expensed 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  pld telekom inc 
consolidated in  the company reported a loss of million  or per share  on total revenues of million  including operating revenues of million 
this compares with a loss in of million  or per share  on total revenues of million operating revenues of million 
the loss of million in incorporates a profit contribution from peterstar of million after profits tax of million  a profit contribution from becet of million after profits tax of million  a profit contribution from bcl of million after profits tax of million  and corporate interest and other income of million  offset by corporate general and administrative costs of million  interest on corporate bank indebtedness and long term debt of million  amortization charges of million  a share of the loss from equity investments of million including amortization of licenses of million and minority interest charges of million relating primarily to peterstar and becet 
operating revenues 
consolidated operating revenues increased by from million in to million in  principally as a result of strong growth in peterstar and becet and the addition of bcl to the portfolio with effect from april  operating revenues from peterstar grew in  to million from million in  due mainly to a continued rapid increase in line penetration from  at december  to  at december  becet contributed operating revenues of million  as compared to million in this increase is attributable to the growth in becet s subscriber base from  at december  to  at december  technocom contributed operating revenues of million in both and from its leasing of telecommunications equipment and from telecommunications projects 
bcl contributed operating revenues of million for the company  and yellow pages contributed million for the full year 
direct costs 
direct costs were of operating revenues in compared to of operating revenues in  and include the direct costs of sales of peterstar  becet  technocom  bcl and yellow pages 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs in include the day to day expenses in all five subsidiary operations four subsidiaries in as well as corporate expenses 
consolidated general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  reflecting the continued growth in the scale and extent of the operating businesses and the acquisition of bcl 
as a percentage of operating revenues these costs continued a downward trend  falling from in to in at the corporate level  general and administrative overhead increased to million in from million in depreciation 
depreciation increased from million in to million in  reflecting capital expenditures within the operating businesses of million as the build out of the peterstar and becet networks progressed 
amortization 
upon the acquisition by the company of its interests in peterstar  becet and technocom incorporating teleport tp  the differential between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to the telecommunications licenses held by these entities 
these licenses  which expire in  and respectively  are being amortized on a straight line basis over the appropriate terms 
in this respect  in  the company incurred total non cash amortization charges of million  including million relating to the telecommunications licenses of peterstar  and million relating to the telecommunications license of becet 
in addition it incurred charges of million relating to goodwill associated with the acquisition of yellow pages and million relating to deferred financing costs 
as well as the million of amortization noted above  the company s share of the results of its equity investments teleport tp  mtr sviaz and rosh telecom which are accounted for on an equity basis  includes amortization of million relating to the telecommunications licenses of teleport tp 
total amortization charges in were million principally relating to the peterstar  becet and teleport tp telecommunications licenses 
interest expense 
on june   the company completed a million private placement consisting of i  units consisting of million aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of senior discount notes together with warrants to purchase a total of  common shares  and ii million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the purchase conversion prices respectively on the warrants and the convertible notes are and per common share 
these debt instruments represent entirely new indebtedness of the company and resulted in an interest charge on long term debt in of million as against zero expense in prior to the completion of this offering the company had a million bank facility with a canadian chartered bank cibc  guaranteed by cable wireless  which resulted in corporate interest charges of million in  as compared with million in  and which together with interest expenses relating to certain indebtedness of technocom yields total interest expense on bank indebtedness of million in million in 
interest and other income 
under the terms of the debt offering  million was deposited into an escrow account  for subsequent disbursement into telecommunications equipment or telecommunications companies in russia and kazakstan 
all funds which had yet to be disbursed were invested throughout the period in short term reverse repurchase agreements secured by us treasury bonds 
these investments  together with interest earned on other cash deposits and miscellaneous other income  produced total interest and other income at the corporate level of million  compared with million in the bulk of the remainder of the million accrued in technocom 
peterstar peterstar had net income of million and an operating profit of million on operating revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million and an operating profit of million on operating revenues of million for the year ended december  ebitda grew to million for the year ended december   representing of revenues  compared to ebitda of million  representing of revenues  for the same period in revenues 
call revenues for the year ended december  million were higher than the call revenues in the year ended december  million  reflecting increases in subscriber lines installed and transit traffic carried during the period 
total subscriber lines increased by  to  at december  from  at december  directly connected customers ie business and residential lines increased to  from  or  over the same period 
lines to cellular operators increased by  to  lines at december  from  lines at december  revenue from line rentals increased by  reflecting the increase in installed lines  both fixed and cellular 
conversely  installation fee grew only at a rate of over the year ended december   reflecting a reduction in the level of fees implemented by peterstar during and the fact that installation fees on cellular lines are substantially lower than on fixed lines 
call revenue accounted for of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to in  installation fees accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to in and line rentals accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to in in addition  in other income represented a further of total revenue 
peterstar is experiencing a shift in its customer base  from foreign companies which used the higher priced international and long distance services to a predominantly russian business and residential market for which local calling is the principal usage 
thus  of peterstar s total network traffic in was local compared with in  of traffic was long distance in compared with in  and only of traffic was international in compared with in these changing traffic patterns are having the effect of reducing revenues per line  total revenue per line for the year ended december  was as against  per line for  while recurring revenue per line calling charges and line rentals were per line as against in the company expects these trends to continue as russian companies and individuals increasingly constitute peterstar s customer base 
peterstar expects line growth for both fixed and cellular services to continue as the market expands for high quality digital telecommunication service  although continuing competition is expected to put pressure on margins 
peterstar believes that its focus on the introduction of data services such as frame relay and atm services which hitherto have not had any significant impact upon its financial results will start to contribute to revenues and improve its competitive positioning 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the gross margin of is slightly lower than the margin of in  with lower tariffs on international traffic being offset by a reduction in the level of payments due to the carriers of this traffic and an increase in local traffic where peterstar  under the terms of its arrangements with pts  does not pay carrier charges 
tariffs 
during there was continuing pressure on international rates part of a global trend in the telecommunications industry 
peterstar also reduced tariffs on certain other routes  in response to competition 
the company expects these conditions to continue in at the same time the local st petersburg operators  pts and spmmts  have been raising rates to the point that there is now relatively little difference for business customers between the price of peterstar s service and the inferior service provided by these operators 
if  as anticipated  pts introduces local call charges in  this will enhance peterstar s ability to compete for local customers 
this will permit peterstar to offset the impact of lower tariffs by increasing its customer base 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in operating expenses represented of revenues in compared to in  as revenue generation grew faster than costs 
in particular  staff costs and depreciation accounted for and  respectively  of total operating expenses for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the same period in the slower growth in staff costs reflected the fact that personnel during only increased to from at the end of  while depreciation was lower because all capital investments in peterstar were made in the latter half of the year 
the company expects peterstar s staff costs to increase at a faster rate in as it develops its customer service and sales functions 
depreciation will also increase as the effects of the investment in plus further capital investments in of approximately million are taken into account 
both of these developments will impact the level of the company s operating expenses in becet international becet recorded net income of million and an operating profit of million on operating revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million and an operating loss of million on revenues of million for the year ended december  ebitda grew to million for the year ended december   compared to ebitda of million for the same period in revenues 
call revenues for the year ended december  million were higher than the call revenues for the same period in million  reflecting a substantial increase in subscribers during the period 
total subscribers increased from  at december  to  at december  subscription fees increased by  connection fees increased by and equipment sales increased by over call revenue accounted for of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to in  subscription fees accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to in  connection fees accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  compared with in  while equipment sales represented of revenues  as against in becet has seen changes in the calling patterns of subscribers between and local and incoming traffic during accounted for of total traffic compared with during  mobile to mobile traffic accounted for of total traffic compared with in  while long distance traffic in accounted for of total traffic compared with during  and international traffic accounted for only of total traffic compared with during these changes reflect the fact that becet s customer base increasingly consists of kazak companies and individuals  who tend not to use its higher priced long distance and international services 
this has had an effect upon per subscriber revenues total revenue per subscriber for the year ended december  was  against  per subscriber for  while recurring revenue per subscriber also reduced from  in to  per subscriber in however the reductions in total per subscriber and recurring per line revenues also stem from the different calling patterns of these classes of customers who generally use as much as less airtime as the foreign business customers 
becet expects both of these trends to continue  however  becet expects to offset the effects of these factors by continuing to expand its overall customer base 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the gross margin of was an improvement from the margin realized in  primarily due to the greater calling volume and reduced dependence on revenues from equipment sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december from million in  reflecting the opening of an additional eight operating sites and the increase in staffing from at the end of to at december  operating expenses represented of revenues in compared to in  the difference representing both becet s increasing realization of economies of scale and substantial growth in revenue generation 
depreciation accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in  in each case reflecting the considerable capital investment in the becet network during and the company expects becet s operating expenses to increase at a faster rate in as it develops its customer service and sales functions in those locations where service started in depreciation is also likely to increase as becet deploys the additional million of capital investment which it has planned for technocom limited technocom recorded a net loss of million and an operating loss of million on operating revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and an operating profit million on operating revenues of million for the year ended december  ebitda showed a loss of million for the year ended december   compared to ebitda of million  for the same period in historically  technocom s primary revenue stream has been from the leasing of telecommunications equipment to teleport tp and mtr sviaz  which generated lease revenues of million during technocom also earned revenues from a number of other telecommunications projects and the provision of marketing services to teleport tp  in total amounting to million in direct costs of million in also relate to the provision of these marketing services to teleport tp 
operating expenses of million included million of general and administrative expenses and million relating to an investment write off 
interest income of million was generated in  compared with million in effective december   technocom acquired an additional interest in teleport which gives tchnocom effective control over teleport tp 
commencing january  teleport tp s results of operations will be consolidated with those of technocom 
as a result  lease revenues earned from teleport tp will be eliminated against teleport tp s lease expense 
marketing services revenue recorded by technocom will likewise be eliminated 
the following is a discussion of teleport s results of operations in when teleport tp was accounted for using the equity method 
technocom s principal asset  teleport  in which it has a interest as at december   recorded a net loss of million and an operating profit of million on revenues of million for the year ended december compared to a net loss of million and an operating profit of million on revenues of million for the year ended december  ebitda decreased to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to ebitda of million for the same period in revenues 
in  teleport generated revenues from three sources international leased circuits  occasional tv broadcasting  and direct dial telephony services 
revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting the increase in international incoming traffic 
revenue from international circuits amounted to of total revenue for the year ended december   as compared with of total revenue in revenue remained relatively stable because circuits are leased for a fixed sum for a term of years  and revenue growth can generally only be achieved by increasing the number of circuits leased 
in this instance total circuits leased at the end of were  compared to  at december  revenue from the provision of international television broadcasting services amounted to million or of total revenue  down from l million of total revenue in other international direct dial services generated million or of total teleport revenue 
the company had anticipated that teleport tp s long distance services would be a contributor to revenues in but delays in installing remote earth stations caused by weather and other logistical difficulties delayed the start up of many sites until very late in the company expects  however  that these services will provide steady revenue growth during and beyond as the various sites planned become operational 
gross profit 
teleport tp gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the gross margin declined to from in  primarily due to the greater dependence on calling revenues than from the higher margin leased circuit revenues 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in general and administrative costs increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million in reflective of increased personnel and other costs relating to the development of the long distance network 
depreciation of assets under capital lease was million for the year ended december   compared with million in  and is expected to increase further in as teleport tp acquires more equipment under lease from technocom for the long distance network 
the company expects teleport tp to increase its operating expenses in as it further develops its long distance services 
further expenditure will be focused on further developments of the customer service and marketing resources 
interest 
lease interest expense decreased from million in to million in resulting from a reduction in rentals payable under the of equipment leases between technocom and teleport 
lease interest expenses in will eliminate as teleport tp results will be consolidated 
baltic communications limited the company acquired bcl on april   and therefore it has only been consolidated for the nine months ended december  there is no comparable information available for prior years 
bcl recorded net income of million and an operating profit of million on revenues of million for the nine months ended december  ebitda of million was also recorded for this period 
revenues 
call revenue accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december   primarily driven by international call minutes 
installation fees accounted for of total revenue with line rentals accounting for the balance 
the company expects that bcl will continue to derive most of its revenue from directly connected business customers and acting as a transit gateway for other international operators 
gross profit 
a gross profit of million was generated for the nine months ended december   a gross margin of 
the company expects this margin to reduce over time as a result of continuing pressure on international rates 
operating expenses 
operating expenses of million were incurred for the nine months ended december   representing of revenues 
staff costs and depreciation account for and respectively of total operating costs for the year ended december  the company does not expect to see any significant change to the operating costs in bcl in st 
petersburg yellow pages yellow pages recorded an operating profit of  on revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of  on revenues of million for the year ended december  gross profit increased to million in  from million in year ended december  versus year ended december  note that all figures included in this comparative analysis between and are presented in accordance with us gaap  rather than canadian gaap in which they were originally reported 
pld telekom inc 
consolidated in  the company reported a loss of million  or per share  on total revenues of million  including operating revenues of million 
this compares with a loss in of million  or per share  on total revenues of million operating revenues of million 
the loss of million in includes a net loss from million after profits tax of million  a net loss from becet of million after profits tax of million  a contribution from technocom of million after profits tax of million and corporate interest income of million  offset by corporate general and administrative costs of million  interest on corporate bank indebtedness of million  amortization charges of million  a share of the loss of teleport tp of million including amortization of licenses of million  minority interest charges of million relating to technocom and other charges of million 
other charges include a write off of the company s interest in north west estates of million and a provision of million for amounts due from a shareholder of peterstar 
operating revenue 
consolidated operating revenues increased by from million in to million in  as a result of strong growth in peterstar and becet and the acquisition of technocom in december operating revenue from peterstar grew in  to million from million in  due primarily to the increase in line penetration from  lines at december  to  lines at december  and the provision of transit services to the three cellular operators in st 
petersburg 
becet  during its first full year of operations  contributed operating revenues of million  as compared to million in this was due primarily to the growth in becet s subscriber base from at december  to  subscribers at december  technocom contributed revenue of million in including revenue of million derived from lease agreements between technocom and teleport tp and sales revenue of million from a non recurring project 
yellow pages  which was acquired during  contributed operating revenue of million 
direct costs 
direct costs were of operating revenues in compared to of operating revenues in  and include the direct costs of sales of peterstar  becet and technocom 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs include the day to day expenses of the subsidiary operations as well as corporate expenses 
consolidated general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  reflecting the growth of the businesses 
at the corporate level  general and administrative overhead increased in  to million from million in this increase was due primarily to higher expenses related to the operations of the management office in london and the executive office in toronto 
depreciation 
depreciation increased from million in to million in  reflecting total capital expenditures of million as the build out of the peterstar and becet networks progressed 
amortization 
in  the company incurred total non cash amortization charges of million including million relating to the telecommunications licenses of peterstar  million relating to the telecommunications license of becet  and million relating to goodwill associated with the acquisition of yellow pages 
in addition to the million in amortization noted above  the company s share of the loss of teleport tp  which is accounted for on an equity basis  includes amortization charges of million 
amortization charges in were million  related to the peterstar and becet telecommunications licenses 
interest expense 
the company s interest charges were million in each of and interest charges in related to a million bank facility with a canadian chartered bank cibc which was guaranteed by cable wireless and to certain indebtedness of technocom 
the bank facility was repaid from the proceeds of the june placement 
the company s interest expense in related to the company s indebtedness with its two largest shareholders  cable wireless and dominion capital inc dominion and a prior bank facility with cibc 
the company s indebtedness to cable wireless and dominion was repaid in august and the prior cibc facility was repaid in full on december  out of the proceeds of the company s december public offering 
loss on disposition of investments and property and equipment 
consistent with its desire to focus on telecommunications as its core business  the company discontinued its real estate development business  conducted through north west estates plc  in in april  the company completed the disposition of its entire interest in north west estates 
as consideration received was nominal  the financial statements therefore reflect a write off of million in respect of the company s investment in north west estates 
the consequences of the settlement of certain liabilities principally in connection with the buy out of a lease due to expire in on vacant office space previously occupied by north west estates approximated the amounts already accrued in this regard and so no additional provisions were required 
provision for amounts due from shareholder of peterstar 
the company has guaranteed telephone billing system lease payments of a shareholder of peterstar totalling million 
lease payments of approximately  are due quarterly until july to december   the company had paid million on account of this guarantee 
at december   full provision was made for all amounts paid to date under the guarantee and for all future amounts 
peterstar company limited peterstar recorded an operating profit of million on revenues of million in  compared to an operating loss of million on revenues of million in ebitda increased to million from million in revenues 
call revenues grew in  to million from million in  due to the increase in installed subscriber lines 
total lines installed increased by in  to  at december  from  at december  directly connected customers ie business and residential lines increased in  to  at december  from  at december  call revenues did not increase in the same proportion reflecting the changing mix of customers  in particular the installation of  lines for the residential community 
call revenues relating to the transit service provided to cellular operators  whereby peterstar acts as an access mechanism for the city s three cellular operators  increased to million in from million in  due to the increased subscriber penetration of the cellular operators and the signing on of the third operator  delta telecom  in the third quarter of revenue from line rentals increased in  to million from million in  due to the increase in installed lines offset by a reduction in rental tariffs effective may installation fees grew in  due to increased line penetration and the sale of a number of definity pabxs in the second quarter 
finally  peterstar signed a contract with spmmts to carry transit traffic across the city into the pts network 
this was a new revenue stream in and had little overall impact on peterstar s total revenues 
average revenue per line for the six months ended december  decreased to  as compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to the changed mix in the product base being offered by peterstar  partially offset by value added services  data services and transit services further contributing to peterstar s total revenue 
direct dial business customers provided the largest call revenue stream for peterstar in with of total call revenue  compared with in  due primarily to higher cellular traffic  which grew to of total revenue in from in revenue from data services accounted for of total peterstar revenue in tariffs 
the reduction in monthly rental tariffs in mid reflected a marketing policy to widen the business customer base of peterstar 
the general reduction in international calling rates at this time was as a result of competitive pressures 
peterstar s margins on long distance and international calls changed during the year as outpayment rates were restructured following a renegotiation by peterstar management 
average international outpayments were reduced  thereby improving the margins on such calls from in to in gross profit 
gross profit increased in  to million from million in the increase in gross margin in to from in was due primarily to the higher margin revenues associated with the provision of transit services to spmmts and the three cellular operators 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  including depreciation  increased in  to million from million in operating costs represented of revenues in compared to in staff costs which include russian payroll taxes amounting to approximately of salaries accounted for of total operating costs for  compared to for  reflecting peterstar s increased staffing from full time staff at december  to full time staff at december  depreciation 
depreciation increased in  to million from million in  due to peterstar s purchase of million of capital equipment  primarily switching  transmission  and cabling equipment 
becet international becet recorded a net loss of million and an operating loss of million on operating revenues of million in this compares with a net loss and an operating loss of million on revenues of million in  but since becet only commenced cellular service in september  year end results for and are not comparable 
revenues 
call revenues in million were higher than in million  due to the fact that the business was only in operation for four months in total subscribers connected increased to  at december  from at december  revenue per subscriber 
recurring revenue per subscriber per quarter averaged  throughout as compared with during the final quarter of subscriber analysis 
foreign joint ventures accounted for of the total becet subscribers at december   compared with at december  in  the largest growth sector was kazak businesses which accounted for  subscribers at the end of from at march this reflects the fact that the target customer for becet is the business to business basic telecommunications customer who considers cellular service as an alternative to the underdeveloped basic telephone network 
gross profit 
gross profit for was million compared to million in the decrease in gross margin from to reflects the fact that in the early period of operations becet charged higher activation fees and achieved very high margins on customer terminals  which were then reduced as terminal prices were reduced to improve penetration 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in  including depreciation increased in  to million from million in  due to an increase in staffing from to  overhead costs associated with the expansion of the network and a full year of operations in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization charges increased to million from million in  reflecting the further capital investment of million in the network during technocom limited the company acquired its interest in technocom in december  and so its results were consolidated by the company for the first time in technocom was formed in  but until its operations consisted almost solely of holding its equity interest in teleport tp 
in  technocom generated ebitda and operating income of million on operating and total revenues of million and million respectively 
this compares with revenues of million and an ebitda loss of million respectively in technocom s primary recurring revenue stream is derived from the leasing of telecommunications equipment to teleport tp  which resulted in revenues of million 
technocom also earned sales revenue of million from a non recurring project and services revenues of million which mainly relate to the marketing of teleport tp s services 
direct costs of million in relate primarily to the non recurring project  which was completed during the year 
operating expenses of million included million of general and administrative costs 
revenues in technocom s principal asset  teleport tp  in which technocom had a equity interest in  increased to million in from million in ebitda was million in  as compared to million in revenues 
in  teleport tp generated revenues from three sources international leased circuits primarily to rostelecom  tv broadcasting and international direct dial services 
the main reason for the significant rise in revenues was the increase in the number of circuits leased to telecommunications carriers from at december  to  at december  revenues from the provision of international television broadcasting services totaled million in  while international direct dial and bandwidth services accounted for million of revenues 
gross profit 
teleport tp s gross profit increased in  to million from million in teleport tp operating expenses 
teleport tp s operating expenses increased in  to million from million in and due to teleport tp s increased staffing and overhead costs associated with the expansion of the network 
interest 
teleport tp incurred lease interest of million paid to technocom under capital leases which commenced during depreciation 
depreciation in teleport tp increased in  to million from million in  due to technocom s purchase of capital equipment which is leased to teleport tp under a capital lease 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company has changed its business activities from those of a diversified company with health care and real estate interests to a company focused on emerging telecommunications markets in the russian federation and kazakstan 
this has involved significant investment in telecommunication assets  licenses  property and equipment  which have been financed through public and private placements of equity stock  a private placement of long term debt instruments  shareholder loans  bank lines of credit and trade financing 
from time to time  the company has had discussions with other telecommunications entities concerning the establishment of possible relationships or other transactions  including the taking of equity positions in the company or its subsidiaries 
while no agreement has materialized to date from any such discussions  the company will continue to consider appropriate opportunities 
effective february   the company continued from ontario into delaware and  in connection therewith  will be moving its executive offices to the united states 
the benefits of this continuance are anticipated to include improved access to the us capital markets  reduced costs of financing and streamlining of management and operations 
the costs of the continuance  including the costs of changing the jurisdiction of incorporation of the company and those involved in setting up executive offices in the united states  are not expected to exceed million 
in addition  upon the change of jurisdiction  the company is potentially subject to two distinct tax charges as a consequence of ceasing to be an ontario corporation i it will be deemed to have disposed of all of its assets at their fair market value as of the date of continuance and revenue canada will assess tax on any income and net taxable capital gains arising thereby  and ii it will be subject to an additional tax on the amount by which the fair market value of the company s assets  net of liabilities  exceeds the paid up capital of the company s issued and outstanding shares at a rate based on certain factual assumptions of 
based on management s analysis and advice received to date  the company believes that no tax will be due

working capital and other balance sheet items in december  the company completed a public offering of  common shares from treasury at a price of per share 
proceeds from the million offering were used to repay corporate debt  acquire a interest in technocom and develop the telecommunications networks 
on june   the company completed a million private placement 
the proceeds which amounted to million after commissions and expenses  were used to pay off the bank facility and to meet the company s outstanding million commitment to technocom  with the remainder being targeted for capital investments in the existing operating units  to fund the development of additional products and services to be delivered over the company s networks and for general corporate purposes 
the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  reflects total assets of million  as compared to million at december  total assets at december  were comprised of million in current assets including million of cash and term deposits  million in property and equipment  million in telecommunications licenses related to peterstar  becet and teleport tp  other assets and investments of million and escrow funds of million 
the funds in escrow were raised from the june placement and are to be disbursed principally for telecommunications equipment to be used in peterstar  becet and bcl and for the development of new value added services 
total indebtedness of million  as a percentage of total assets  was at december  the corresponding figures at december  were million and 
shareholders equity of million at december  consisted of million in common shares and million ascribed to the placement warrants offset by the company s deficit of million 
the company s ratio of total indebtedness to equity at december  was compared with at december  at december   the company had a working capital surplus of million reflecting the unexpended portion of the net proceeds of the june placement which were not escrowed 
this compares to a working capital deficit of million at december  when there was also an outstanding commitment to contribute million to technocom  as discussed above  this was fulfilled out of the proceeds of the june placement 
the cash on hand and escrow funds  which totaled in excess of million after subtracting bank indebtedness as of december   are to be used to implement the business plans of the operating subsidiaries into  although the company s ability to access these funds freely is restricted since the funds in escrow can only be accessed after compliance with a number of conditions  including ensuring that the funds are only used for certain designated purposes and that certain other safeguards are in place 
to the extent that i actual cash flows from operations are below the company s estimates as a result of lower than expected revenues per line or higher operating costs or ii development costs of the build out of the peterstar  becet and technocom teleport networks exceed current estimates  the company may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing 
taxation the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of taxes in different jurisdictions 
the most significant taxes affecting the company and its subsidiaries are likely to be taxes in russia and kazakstan including withholding taxes and income taxes payable by the company in canada and  following its continuance to delaware  in the united states 
withholding taxes could apply to distributions by the company s businesses in russia and kazakstan and to distributions by intermediate level companies in jurisdictions outside russia  kazakstan and canada 
the company has attempted to mitigate the potential for withholding tax liabilities by structuring its investments through a cypriot holding company  thereby taking advantage of the double taxation treaty between the russian federation and cyprus 
in general  the company s russian and kazak businesses are faced with a wide variety of taxes  including property taxes  advertising taxes  road taxes  housing taxes  transport taxes and education taxes 
in addition  peterstar  technocom and becet are subject to corporate profits taxes of  and  respectively 
the tax systems in russia and kazakstan have changed rapidly in recent years and may undergo additional changes  which may have a material adverse effect on the company 
as of january   the exemption from the russian import vat for technological equipment including telecommunications equipment has been repealed 
since no regulations have been published to date  it is currently unclear whether such vat payments will be recoverable by the company or its subsidiaries 
therefore  the consequences for the company and its subsidiaries of the repeal of the exemption are uncertain as this time 
see risk factors risks involving the company taxation 
technocom established a representative office in moscow in october and registered this office with the relevant russian tax authorities 
the company understands that  while the tax implications of establishing such an office are not totally clear  this could result in technocom becoming subject to profits and other russian taxes as of such date 
inasmuch as technocom operated to some extent in the russian federation prior to this date  without clarifying its tax status with any russian taxing authority  it is also possible that tax officials may take the position that technocom may be subject to vat and or profits and other russian taxes with respect to the period before october at december   the company has operating loss carryforwards for canadian income tax purposes of approximately cdn 
million us million which are available to offset future taxable income through in addition  the company has allowable capital loss carryforwards of approximately cdn 
million us million which are available to offset future taxable capital gains 
upon the company s emigration to the united states in february  the company is deemed to dispose of all its assets at fair value 
as a result  a substantial portion of the operating and capital loss carryforwards will be utilized 
currency controls the russian federation exchange controls 
the russian federation currently has in place relatively liberal policies regarding hard currency transfers by russian residents to non residents 
payments in us dollars may generally be made freely between russian residents which generally includes all russian companies and citizens resident in russia and non residents which generally includes non russian companies even if they have a representative office or other permanent establishment in russia for current currency transactions generally those where payment is made within days of the provision of goods and services 
payments in us dollars classified as movements of capital which generally includes direct investments  portfolio investments  acquisition of real estate and payments made pursuant to loan  lease  sale of goods and services agreements having terms of over days are subject to licensing by the central bank 
while peterstar believes that it has applied for all the necessary licenses  not all licenses have been received 
failure to apply for the appropriate licenses  or to receive the outstanding licenses could result in fines and penalties 
additionally  delays in the receipt of licenses will also delay the time at which the company can start to realize cashflows from the leasing of assets to its operating subsidiaries in russia 
payments between russian residents must generally be made in roubles 
russian companies may exchange roubles for us dollars if they can document us dollar denominated liabilities that are due and payable within specified periods 
russian companies are required to convert of most hard currency earnings into roubles  but as noted in the preceding sentence may be able to reconvert such amounts into hard currency if they can document hard currency denominated liabilities that are due and payable within a specified period 
roubles may not be lawfully exported from  or converted into  other currencies outside of russia 
availability of hard currency for conversion purposes 
the ability of foreign investors to convert roubles into hard currency is also subject to the availability of hard currency in the russian currency markets 
although there is an existing market within russia for the conversion of roubles into other currencies  including the interbank currency exchange  over the counter and currency futures markets  the development of this market is uncertain 
exchange rates 
significant fluctuations in the value of the rouble against the us dollar and other hard currencies can also have a material impact on the value of a foreign investor s rouble dividend income or rouble proceeds from the sale of rouble denominated securities 
in recent years  the rouble has experienced a significant depreciation relative to the us dollar and other hard currencies  although during it achieved relative stability vis a vis the us dollar and other hard currencies 
repatriation 
although russian law governing foreign investment guarantees foreign investors the right to repatriate their earnings from russian investments  the russian exchange control regime  including licensing requirements administered by the central bank  may materially affect their ability to do so and may increase the cost of such repatriation 
kazakstan exchange controls 
kazakstan currently has in place relatively liberal policies governing hard currency transfers by kazak residents to non residents 
residents which generally includes all kazak companies and citizens resident in kazakstan can use hard currency to pay non residents which generally includes all non kazak companies and their branch offices and representative offices in kazakstan for current currency transactions generally those where payment is made within days of the provision of goods or services 
payments in us dollars classified as movements of capital which generally includes direct investments  portfolio investments  payments with respect to real estate and payments made after days for goods and services are subject to licensing by the national bank of kazakstan 
payments between kazak residents must generally be made in tenge 
kazak companies may exchange tenge for us dollars if they can document us dollar denominated liabilities that are due and payable within specified periods 
the national bank of kazakstan does not currently require the conversion of hard currency earnings into tenge 
tenge may not be lawfully exported from kazakstan or converted into other currencies outside of kazakstan 
availability of hard currency for conversion purposes 
the ability of foreign investors to convert tenge into hard currency is also subject to the availability of hard currency in the kazak currency markets 
although there is an existing market within kazakstan for the conversion of tenge into other currencies  including the interbank currency exchange and the over the counter markets  the development of this market is uncertain 
exchange rates 
significant fluctuations in the value of the tenge against the us dollar and other hard currencies can also have a material impact on the value of a foreign investor s tenge dividend income or tenge proceeds for the sale of tenge denominated securities 
since january  the tenge has experienced relative stability against the us dollar and other hard currencies 
repatriation 
kazakstan s foreign investment legislation provides that earnings from investments made by foreign investors may be freely repatriated provided that all applicable fees and taxes have been paid 
however  the exchange control regime in kazakstan may materially affect an investor s ability to do so and may increase the cost of such repatriation 
inflation since the break up of the soviet union  both the russian and kazak economies have been characterized by high rates of inflation 
although in  inflation in both countries decreased substantially  there is no assurance that these trends will continue 
in recent years  the devaluation of the rouble and tenge has not kept pace with inflation 
to the extent that the company s costs are denominated in the rouble or the tenge and devaluation of these currencies does not fully offset inflation  the company s local currency costs will increase in hard currency terms 
if the company s businesses are unable to increase prices in line with inflation  due to competitive pressures or otherwise  the results of operations of the company s businesses may be adversely affected
