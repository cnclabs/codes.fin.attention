item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following financial review discusses the performance of first of america  on a consolidated basis  for the three years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

 west suburban financial lgf bancorp  inc  corporation goldome federal branches  on february   first of america acquired huttenlochers kerns norvell  inc  an insurance agency located in southeast michigan 
this acquisition provides further opportunity to enhance this revenue source which increased million for over highlights net income for was million  up percent compared with the million earned in  and earnings per share were versus 
the current year s results reflected the impact of the federal deposit insurance corporation s one time assessment fee of million net of tax  or per share  to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund  gains from branch sales of million net of tax  and one time charges of million net of tax associated with severance and various write downs 
for  the results included restructuring charges of million net of tax and gains from branch office sales of million net of tax 
return on average assets was percent for compared with percent for and percent for return on average equity was up for the year over year comparison  percent compared with percent 
return on average equity was percent in asset quality improved from the solid levels reported in and nonperforming assets were percent of total assets  lower than the percent and percent reported at year end and  respectively 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans for was percent  higher than the percent and percent  respectively  for and the increase in the ratio from to was primarily due to a decreasing loan portfolio  which resulted from a planned balance sheet restructuring  the increase from to was the result of the higher charge offs experienced industry wide in consumer loan portfolios 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans did increase  however  to percent at year end compared with percent at year end  as the provision for loan loss expense covered net charge offs by percent and total loans were billion lower 
the allowance as a percent of total loans was percent at december  total assets were billion at december   decreasing percent from the billion reported at december   as a result of targeted balance sheet restructuring efforts 
higher priced deposits and selected loan portfolios with narrower net interest spreads were reduced and greater emphasis was placed on loans and deposits meeting specific targeted returns 
total assets were billion at december  the to decrease can also be attributed to the restructuring of the balance sheet and to the june securitization of million in credit card receivables 
total loans decreased percent due to pricing strategies implemented to improve the profitability of the installment and residential mortgage portfolios 
the commercial and commercial mortgage portfolios  however  experienced moderate growth during  up percent from total shareholders equity remained level with a year ago at billion even with the million shares repurchased in book value per share increased to at december  compared with and for year ends and discussion of an additional repurchase program is presented in the capital strength section later in this document 
the total risk based capital ratio of percent at year end was the highest reported by first of america since it began computing risk based ratios in the regulatory requirement for this ratio is percent 
in august  the board of directors increased the cash dividend per common share by percent to annually 
this increase indicated the board s continued confidence in first of america s profitability and represents the fourteenth year in a row that the dividend was increased 
one indicator of the registrant s continuing progress is that first of america s stock reached its highest closing price ever   on november   and closed at on december  up percent from in november  several organizational changes were announced  to be completed in  which are designed to continue the registrant s efforts towards a delivery system that revolves around customers needs and is organized by business lines 
the changes will further realign the company from a geographic focus  devote more resources to sales incentives and sales training  reduce costs for delivery of products and services  and improve prospects for increased profitability 
the financial impact of these changes was partially recognized in the fourth quarter of as noted previously 
an additional change announced in november is the registrant s planned mid consolidation of its four affiliate banks into one operating unit as permitted under legislation which provides for full interstate banking at that time 
this change will not take the company away from its community banking roots  but rather will serve to strengthen its commitment to those communities 
for example  community and regional presidents will continue to be actively involved in the communities they serve  but they will also have business line responsibilities

income analysis net interest income 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis was million  down percent from million in the higher net interest margin for  percent versus percent  more than offset a percent decrease in average earning assets 
first of america completed the securitization of million in credit card receivables during mid year  shifting revenue from interest income to non interest fee revenue 
if net interest income was restated for the impact of the securitization  s net interest income would have been level with last year s 
for compared with  net interest income fte decreased percent primarily due to the impact of the credit card securitization 
table iii presents a summary of the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volumes and rates for and net interest income  average balance sheet amounts  and the corresponding yields and costs for the years through are shown in table iv 
total interest income fte declined percent in as illustrated in table iii  the decrease resulted mainly from a lower volume of earning assets 
on the other hand  interest expense was down percent as a result of lower rates on interest bearing liabilities and a billion decrease in average interest bearing liabilities 
the combination of these changes resulted in the percent decrease in net interest income fte

in   and  money market checking accounts are included in savings and now accounts  in  they are included in money market savings accounts 
net interest margin 
the net interest margin was percent in  higher than the percent reported in  as a result of pricing strategies implemented to improve the interest spread of certain loan products to achieve the corporation s targeted return on equity and on improving the mix within deposits and borrowings 
the balance sheet restructuring completed in helped increase the net interest margin as less profitable earning assets and deposits were sharply reduced  and targeted  more profitable loan portfolios and deposit products increased 
especially affected were investments  which declined by percent and certificates of deposits  which were lower by percent 
the net interest margin improved steadily throughout  reaching percent in the fourth quarter as a result of the actions taken 
if s net interest margin was adjusted for the impact of the june credit card securitization  the increase year over year would have been basis points  as the credit card securitization shifted interest income to non interest income 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is based on the current level of net charge offs and management s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
for  the provision for loan losses was increased percent to million from million in to adequately cover net charge offs and the higher risk of loss being experienced in the credit card and installment loan portfolios 
the provision was million 
the percent coverage of net charge offs by the provision for loan losses  the decrease in the loan portfolio due to the balance sheet restructuring  and the securitization of million in credit card receivables contributed to the higher allowance as a percent of total loans ratio which was percent  up from percent at december  and percent at december  as a percent of average assets  the provision was percent compared with the percent and percent reported for and  respectively 
additional information on the provision for loan losses  net charge offs and nonperforming assets is provided in tables ix and xi under the caption  credit risk profile  presented later in this discussion 
non interest revenue 
non interest revenue of million was up percent over excluding branch sale gains from both and  total non interest revenue would have increased percent over non interest revenue totaled million in and million in branch sale gains of million and million in net servicing fees from the credit card securitization were the primary reasons for the higher level of non interest revenue in compared with table v presents the trends in the major components of non interest revenue from to non interest revenue and non interest expense table v in thousands change amount percent non interest revenue service charges on deposits       trust and financial services revenue       investment securities transaction    nm other operating revenue       total non interest revenue       non interest expense personnel       occupancy  net      equipment      data processing      amortization of intangibles       fdic premiums      other operating expense       total non interest expense       non interest revenue as a percent of average assets non interest expense as a percent of average assets burden ratio efficiency ratio efficiency ratio  excluding fdic premiums service charges on deposit accounts remained a significant component of non interest revenue in new fee structures and a slightly higher volume of non interest transaction deposits accounted for the percent increase over in total  trust and financial services revenue was the largest component of non interest revenue for  increasing percent over a year ago 
traditional trust fees increased percent as assets under management increased percent 
other financial services fees  generated by cash management  investment management  brokerage  securities trading and underwriting along with insurance services  increased percent  benefiting from the sales and services strategies implemented in partnership with the branch employees 
total revenue from the sale of parkstone and other mutual funds and annuities was million compared with million in insurance revenue for was million compared to million in reflecting the registrant s expanding commitment to this product line 
net losses on the sales of investment securities totaled million compared with gains of million in and million in during december  first of america transferred all of its held to maturity securities into the available for sale classification 
more detail on that reclassification is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document 
at december   the amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled billion and had a corresponding market value of billion compared to billion and billion  respectively  for the changes in the relative market value of available for sale securities resulted in an adjustment which decreased shareholders equity million for bank card revenue totaled million  up percent over the million earned in the total included million in net fees from the june credit card securitization while included million of securitization fees 
annualizing these net fees  bank card revenue would have decreased in due to higher net charge offs in the securitized portfolio 
the securitization shifted revenue from interest income to fee revenue but had minimal impact on net income  its benefit was that the funds it provided allowed the company to reduce short term borrowings  effectively lowering interest expense 
bank card revenue totaled million in the managed credit card portfolio  which includes the million in receivables remaining on the balance sheet and the securitized receivables  was billion at december   level with a year ago 
mortgage banking revenue of million decreased percent from the million for the main reasons for the decrease were a million increase in amortization of originated mortgage servicing rights and a million decrease in mortgage appraisal revenue 
other operating revenue increased percent over the largest component of this category  gains on branch sales  was million for compared to million for the review of branch offices to determine their fit with the company s strategies is an ongoing activity which was intensified during the internal restructuring effort 
also included in this total were nonaffiliate corporate services at million  up percent  letter of credit fees at million  up percent  and the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance at million 
non interest expense 
as detailed in table v  non interest expense was million  up percent from non interest expense for included million for the fdic one time assessment and million for severance and writedowns 
if one time charges are excluded from both years expense included million of restructuring charges non interest expense would have increased only percent over non interest expense was percent of average assets for and percent for total personnel cost was million in compared with million in and million in excluding severance charges  personnel cost increased percent as higher incentives for improved sales performance more than offset the reduction in total personnel 
total full time equivalent employees ftes were  at december   and included employees who received notification that their positions were being eliminated as part of the company s ongoing restructuring process 
in addition  approximately employees are expected to be notified by the end of the first quarter of total ftes were  at december  and  in august when the restructuring efforts began 
two ratios which measure internal efficiencies are the number of ftes per one million dollars of average assets and net income per fte 
for  there were ftes per one million dollars of average assets compared with a year ago  and  of net income per fte versus  a year ago 
these ratios were and  for net occupancy and equipment costs were million for and remained level with other operating expense  which includes all the other costs of doing business such as advertising  supplies  travel  telephone  professional fees and outside services purchased  was million in  up percent from s total of million 
as a percent of average assets  other operating expense was percent compared with percent in and percent in the ratio increased as a combined result of the increase in other operating expense and the decrease in average assets during efficiency ratio and burden ratio 
the efficiency ratio measures non interest expense as a percent of the sum of net interest income fte and non interest income 
the lower the ratio  the more efficiently a company s resources produce revenue 
table v presents the efficiency ratio over the last five years 
in  the efficiency ratio was percent down slightly compared with percent a year ago 
the burden ratio measures the relationship of non interest income and expense to average assets 
the burden ratio has improved over the five year period presented in table v 
the five basis point improvement in the burden ratio compared with was a result of non interest income increasing at a faster rate than non interest expense 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in compared with million in and million in a summary of significant tax components is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document 
pro forma results cash earnings the calculation of cash earnings provides an alternative analysis of first of america s results 
cash earnings adds back the amortization of intangibles and assumes that all intangibles were charged off against retained earnings upon the original acquisition date of all mergers accounted for as purchases 
these pro forma results  as detailed below  indicate that first of america s underlying return on equity for the last three years would have been within the to percent range 
also earnings per share and return on assets would have been higher than reported 
the book value per share  while lower than the reported for year end  would be the equivalent of a reported tangible book value per share 
in fact  the tier i leverage ratio  the strictest regulatory capital ratio  remains unchanged under these assumptions since it already excludes intangibles from its computation

as a result  first of america currently measures the individual performance of four business lines community banking  bank card  mortgage lending and trust and financial services as well as the performance of certain product lines within those businesses 
a fifth category  corporate investments and funding  includes activities that are not directly attributable to one of the four major lines of business 
in developing the management accounting system for line of business reporting  certain assumptions and allocations were necessary 
equity was allocated on the basis of required regulatory levels  inherent operational risk or market determined factors as evidenced by similar independent single business line companies 
support services which were centrally provided were allocated on a per unit cost basis or in proportion to the balances of assets and liabilities associated with a particular business line 
funds transfer pricing was used to allocate a cost of funds used or a credit for funds provided from market determined indices 
because of the assumptions and allocations utilized  the financial results of the individual business lines might vary from the actual results if those lines were in fact separate operating entities 
table vi presents summarized income statements and performance ratios for and for the four business lines identified above 
the results for have been restated utilizing the revised methodology developed in community banking 
the community banking business line is responsible for gathering and managing deposits  lending to commercial and consumer installment customers  and managing the four state branch networks for the delivery of first of america s products and services 
it also provides customers with home equity and student loans  international banking services and other general banking services  such as atm operations and safety deposit boxes 
community banking is the core of first of america s business activities  and its contribution to the consolidated net income is the largest of the business lines 
this business line reported income before goodwill and one time charges of million for compared to million for return on equity increased to percent in from percent in investment in florida s physical franchise  advertising and other developmental activities affected community banking s results  however  progress continues to be made on re mixing the florida franchise s customer base  changing its product offerings  and updating its delivery systems 
bank card 
bank card is responsible for managing and servicing first of america s billion managed portfolio of both credit card and other revolving loans  as well as the merchant services operation 
in addition to the managed portfolio of visa mastercard credit cards  bank card manages affinity cards for groups and offers a firstair card 
the revolving portfolio remained relatively level with as national promotions were not emphasized during in  promotional emphasis will continue to target regional markets 
this business line continues to be a strong performer as net income for was million and million for the efficiency ratio was percent and the return on allocated equity was percent for compared to percent and percent  respectively  for credit quality improved from and is reflected in the provision for loan losses of million for  down from million reported last year 
mortgage lending 
mortgage lending originates all residential mortgages across first of america s four community banking states and in stand alone origination offices in arizona and north carolina 
the loans are originated both for portfolio retention and sale to the secondary market 
mortgage lending also provides servicing for first of america s entire portfolio and a billion portfolio for external investors 
since mortgage lending is responsible for originating  servicing and managing first of america s residential loan portfolio  the portfolio s interest income and related funds transfer charge are included in mortgage lending s net income 
mortgage lending earned the lowest return on equity of the four business lines in and its results can fluctuate substantially from period to period since origination activity is rate sensitive  and gains on loan sales vary directly with the volume of originations 
during the year  billion of mortgages were sold into the secondary market resulting in gains on the sale of mortgages of million compared with million in mortgage lending s net income for was million compared with million in trust and financial services 
trust and financial services provides traditional trust services to individuals and institutions  as well as investment management  brokerage as well as trading and underwriting services 
it also manages first of america s proprietary mutual funds  the parkstone group of funds  along with insurance services and annuity products 
this business line earned the highest return on allocated equity at percent for  down from percent for the nature of its business activity fee generating and personnel intensive will generally result in comparatively higher returns on equity and higher efficiency ratios 
net income was million for  up from million for  primarily from increased customer investment activity and the steadily increasing market value of its managed assets upon which fees are assessed 
its managed assets totaled billion at year end and billion at year end the business line s efficiency ratio was percent in and percent in revenue growth in has largely been in lower profit margin products such as brokerage services and mutual fund sales while the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and the costs added by insurance agency acquisitions 
corporate investments and funding 
the corporate investments and funding category includes activities relating to the management of the corporation s liquidity needs 
this includes the management of the corporation s investment securities and borrowing portfolios  the net effect of funds transfer pricing  eliminations of intercompany transactions  and long term benefits funding 
the million change in income before goodwill and one time items was mainly due to a million increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance for and the net effect of funds transfer pricing and intercompany eliminations 
non interest expense for the corporate support function was allocated from this area to the four primary lines of business based on direct expenses 
credit risk profile first of america s community banking structure helps minimize its credit risk exposure 
community banking means that loans are made in local markets to consumers and small to mid sized businesses from deposits gathered in the same market 
a centralized  independent loan review staff evaluates the loan portfolio of each line of business on a regular basis and shares its evaluation with the management of the business line as well as corporate management 
first of america s loan portfolio includes a large percentage of loans with balances less than  which effectively reduces total portfolio risk 
at year end  consumer installment and revolving loans totaled percent of the total portfolio  one to four family residential mortgages and home equity loans accounted for percent  commercial loans totaled percent  and commercial mortgages totaled percent 
first of america does not have any concentrations of credit risk to any specific borrower or within any geographic area 
the total loan portfolio  as presented in table vii  was billion at year end  down percent from billion a year ago 
components of the loan portfolio table vii in thousands december  consumer      commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      total loans      consumer loans 
first of america s consumer loan portfolio  which includes indirect and direct installment loans  credit cards and other revolving loans  declined percent from s level 
the managed credit card portfolio at billion remained level with first of america offers its credit card products in all fifty states  the largest portion of the portfolio  percent  was to customers in its four operating states 
as a percent of average loans  the net charge offs for the managed portfolio were percent in compared with percent in the consumer installment portfolio was billion at december   down percent from the previous year due to the combination of intense competition within the industry and first of america s more stringent pricing policies 
first of america s consumer installment loans originate primarily from its four state operating area 
net charge offs as a percent of average consumer installment loans were percent in and percent in management decreased the provision in due to the improved loan quality being observed within the portfolio 
residential mortgage loans 
at december   residential mortgage loans totaled billion compared with billion at year end originations of residential mortgage loans during were billion compared with billion in the average loan size in the balance sheet portfolio was  and the loans in portfolio were originated within first of america s four operating states as well as stand alone origination offices in other states 
first of america s portfolio continued to have excellent credit quality measurements 
net charge offs as a percent of average residential mortgage loans were percent in and percent in at december   residential mortgage loans held for sale totaled million with a market value of million 
these residential mortgages are closed and therefore included in outstandings on the balance sheet 
in addition  first of america has entered into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans  at prevailing market rates  totaling million 
mandatory commitments to deliver mortgage loans to investors  at prevailing market rates  totaled million as of december  commercial and commercial mortgage loans 
first of america s commercial and commercial mortgage loan portfolio is comprised primarily of loans to small and mid sized businesses within the local markets of its four operating states 
evidence of this philosophy is the average loan size within this portfolio at year end which was  for commercial loans and  for commercial mortgages  allowing for a more diverse customer base and limiting exposure from any one borrower 
first of america has no foreign loans  no highly leveraged transactions and no syndicated purchase participations 
maturity and rate sensitivity of selected loan categories is presented in table viii 
first of america s commercial and commercial mortgages demonstrated the highest growth of any of the portfolios during this portfolio grew percent to billion compared with billion at year end total non performing commercial and commercial mortgage loans as a percent of outstandings decreased to percent from percent a year ago  and net charge offs as a percent of average loans was  constant with maturity and rate sensitivity of selected loans table viii in thousands one year one year to after december  or less five years five years total commercial  financial and agricultural     commercial tax exempt     real estate construction     total     total loans above due after one year with predetermined interest rate    with floating or adjustable interest rates    total    asset quality

while management has identified these loans as requiring additional monitoring  they do not necessarily represent future nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses is determined by management taking into consideration charge off experience  estimated loss exposure on specific loans and the current and projected economic climate 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly based on information compiled by the corporate loan review area 
management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses over the last five years is presented in table x 
the amounts indicated for each loan type include amounts allocated for specific loans as well as a general allocation 
the allowance coverage of non performing loans at year end was percent compared with percent at year end and percent at year end it is management s judgment that the level of the allowance is adequate to absorb potential loan losses 
other ratios measuring asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are presented in table xi

funding is achieved through growth in core deposits and accessibility to the money and capital markets 
deposits 
first of america s primary source of funding is its core deposits which include all deposits except negotiated certificates of deposit 
as a percent of total deposits  core deposits were percent at year end and percent at year end first of america does not issue negotiated cd s in the national money markets  and has established a policy limit of ten percent of assets to provide a guideline for assisting in the prudent management of the corporations s purchased funds position

the average deposit balances outstanding and the rates paid on those deposits for the three years ended december   are presented in table xii 
the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more at year end is detailed in table xiii 
in addition to deposits  first of america s sources of funding include money market borrowings  capital funds  securitizations and long term debt 
first of america entered into a three year competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement dated as of march  and amended by its first amendment dated december  and by the second amendment dated february  collectively  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows first of america to borrow up to million on a standby revolving credit basis on an uncommitted competitive advance basis 
the proceeds of all borrowings made pursuant to the credit agreement will be used to provide working capital or for general corporate purposes

first of america s interest rate risk policy is to attempt to minimize the effect on net income resulting from a change in interest rates through asset liability management at all levels in the company 
each quarter an interest rate sensitivity analysis is completed for each affiliate  as well as the corporation as a whole  using an asset liability management model 
additional analysis is completed and reviewed each month related to the interest rate sensitivity of the corporation 
the asset and liability committees  which exist at each banking affiliate and at the corporate level  review the analysis and as necessary  take appropriate action to ensure compliance with policy and strategic objectives relating to prudent interest rate risk management 
interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying financial instrument 
the company becomes a counterparty in the exchange of interest payments with other parties and  therefore  is exposed to the loss of future interest payments should the counterparty default 
the company minimizes this risk by performing normal credit reviews of its counterparties and collateralizing its exposure when it exceeds a predetermined limit 
first of america had outstanding interest rate swap agreements at december   totaling million in notional amounts versus million at december  this total included notional amounts of million as a hedge against the parent company s subordinated notes due february   and million against various fixed rate bank notes 
the aggregate market value of interest rate swaps at year end was a positive thousand 
the full year impact from swap activity on net interest income was a negative million  the impact was a negative million 
if interest rates increased one hundred basis points  first of america would decrease net interest income thousand over the next twelve months from its current interest rate swap agreements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document provides further detail on first of america s interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities is represented in a gap report  gap being the difference between rate sensitive assets and liabilities and includes the impact of off balance sheet interest rate swap and cap agreements 
table xiv presents first of america s gap position at december   for one year and shorter periods  and table xv details the company s five year gap position 
the gap reports reliability in measuring the risk to income from a change in interest rates is tested through the use of simulation models 
at year end simulation models showed that less than four percent of first of america s annual net income was at risk if interest rates were to move up or down by one percent in a parallel fashion 
however  changing economic conditions affect results  therefore  the management of first of america s interest rate sensitivity is an ongoing process 
management has determined that the simulation models provide a more meaningful measurement of the company s interest rate risk positions than the following gap tables

capital strength regulatory requirements 
first of america s capital policy is to maintain its capital levels above minimum regulatory guidelines 
at december   the federal reserve required a tier i risk based capital ratio of percent and a total risk based capital ratio of percent 
in  the federal reserve also adopted a new leverage capital adequacy standard 
this ratio compares tier i capital to reported total assets and requires a minimum ratio of percent in order to be categorized as adequately capitalized 
as shown in table xvi  at december   first of america s capital ratios exceeded required regulatory minimums with a tier i risk based ratio of percent  a total risk based ratio of percent and a tier i leverage ratio of percent 
capital ratios exclude the mark to market adjustment for available for sale securities in accordance with the federal reserve s regulations 
the long term debt which qualified as tier ii capital at december   consisted of million in subordinated notes due february   a million subordinated note which matures ratably over a five year period beginning december   and million in subordinated notes due july  this debt is included in tier ii capital on a weighted maturity basis 
additional information relating to first of america s various long term debt agreements is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this document 
in january  first of america privately placed million of fixed rate capital securities through first of america capital trust i  a newly formed delaware business trust  controlled by the registrant 
the capital securities of first of america capital trust i were priced at par 
cash distributions are payable semi annually on january and july  beginning july  the proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes and will further enhance the registrant s strong capital position  while reducing the cost of capital

total shareholders equity 
first of america s total shareholders equity at year end remained level with a year ago at billion as the earnings retention for was offset by the impact of the stock repurchased during the year 
in addition to the repurchase of the million common shares completed in  the board of directors  in january  authorized the repurchase of up to two million additional shares of first of america common stock 
any shares repurchased under this authorization will be used for general corporate purposes and may be available for reissuance in connection with the company s stock based compensation plans  dividend reinvestment plan and employee savings plan 
in conclusion first of america s management currently expects continued improvement in the net interest margin and return on assets ratios in and the return on equity for should be between percent and percent and for  between percent and percent 
in addition  the efficiency ratio is currently anticipated to be below percent by the end of management believes the benefits of the company s move to a single operating unit along with a focus on business lines  the internal restructuring effort  and the emphasis on pricing products by market and customer type provide the fundamentals for the achievement of these goals 
the foregoing management statements of expectations for future return on equity and efficiency ratios are forward looking statements 
the achievement of these expectations is uncertain  as first of america s actual performance and financial results may differ from those anticipated as a result of a variety of factors  including but not limited to assumed rates of revenue growth  expense reductions  changes in the economy  competition and the implementation of internal business plans
