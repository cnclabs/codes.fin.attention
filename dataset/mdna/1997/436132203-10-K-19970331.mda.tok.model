table games drop at the sands declined million during compared with and did not change significantly during compared with the sands decrease in table drop compares with an increase of in table drop for all other atlantic city casinos during the same period 
as a result  the sands table game market share expressed as a percentage of the atlantic city industry aggregate table game drop declined to from during table game drop throughout was adversely impacted by the increase in competitive pressures in the rated table market segment  of which a significant portion was in the high end and midmarket segments 
the second half of also saw a decline in the unrated table market segment as expansions at competing properties  construction on roadways into the city and other factors all served to reduce unrated table play at the sands

the greater percentage increase in the number of slot machines for other atlantic city casinos reflects  in part  expansions of certain facilities during which resulted in an overall increase of approximately  square feet of casino space and further contributed to the sands decline in market share 
although the sands increase in the average number of slot machines during was comparable to the overall atlantic city industry increase  the sands increase in slot machine handle lagged the increase in handle for all other atlantic city casinos 
during the second quarter of  the sands discontinued certain marketing programs and promotions particularly slot promotions which included cash giveaways which management deemed to be only marginally profitable 
this strategy worked well during the second quarter  however  entering the peak summer season  many of the sands competitors increased such spending programs and the sands lost market share in the highly profitable mass market segment 
revenues casino revenues at the sands decreased by million during compared with most of the decline in casino revenues is attributable to table games which were impacted by both a decline in gross wagering as discussed previously and by a significant and unusual decrease in table games hold percentage at the sands to during compared to during the increase in slot machine wagering at the sands during compared to was more than offset by a decline in the slot machine hold percentage to from

the increase is primarily due to the expansion of various marketing programs in response to competitive pressures 
during much of  an unprecedented and highly aggressive industry wide attempt to increase market share resulted in significantly higher costs with respect to coin incentive packages offered to bus patrons 
the additional costs of such programs result in greater allocation of rooms  food and beverage and other expenses to casino expense 
the increase results from higher operating costs during the first half of due to increased casino patronage at the expanded sands facility

the increase was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization resulting from the opening of the tunica casino 
such opening resulted in an additional million of depreciation and amortization during compared to amortization of preopening costs amortization of deferred preopening costs represents the amortization of costs incurred in connection with the openings of the aurora casino and the tunica casino 
such costs  which include preopening training and general and administrative costs  were fully amortized in development expenses development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with hcc s pursuit of potential gaming opportunities in jurisdictions where additional gaming licenses may be available as well as those where gaming has not been legalized 
such costs decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of an overall decrease in prospective venues and projects 
development expenses increased by million in compared to primarily as a result of the abandonment and write off of million of costs deferred during for certain development projects which proved infeasible 
additional project costs written off amounted to approximately million 
excluding the effect of such write offs  development expenses decreased by approximately million in as a result of an overall decrease in suitable venues and projects

an evaluation of net realizable value for such sites resulted in a write down for the anticipated loss on disposal of the properties of million 
interest interest income decreased  for the year ended december  compared with and  for the year ended december  compared with the decrease in interest income is primarily due to the expenditure of cash on construction projects from funds reserved for such purposes and the overall decline in cash generated from operations at the sands  both of which reduced the amount of cash available for temporary cash investments 
the decrease results from comparison to an unusually high level of interest income in interest expense increased million and million  respectively  during and compared to the prior years 
substantially all of the interest expense increase was experienced by the hcc group and is attributable to interest incurred on million of senior secured notes issued during october  partially offset by the elimination of interest from the retirement of previously outstanding debt 
such increases were partially offset by the increased capitalization of interest on construction projects 
substantially all of the interest expense increase was again experienced by the hcc group and is attributable to incremental interest incurred on certain debt issued in june in connection with construction of the tunica casino and the senior secured notes  partially offset by reductions of interest from the retirement of previously outstanding debt 
the increase was compounded by the capitalization of interest expense associated with the construction of the tunica casino million 
loss on disposal of assets during  gbcc experienced a loss on disposal of assets amounting to million resulting from the write off of deferred option costs with respect to the planned purchase of a site for future expansion 
loss on disposal of assets during includes the sale of excess barges by hct which were acquired in january together with other assets of the partially completed tunica project from the project s previous owner 
the barges were sold to third parties at a price below management s estimate of net realizable value  resulting in a loss on the sale 
write down of affiliate receivables in connection with a refinancing of its indebtedness in  gbcc issued million discounted principal amount of deferred interest notes the ppi funding notes to hcc in exchange for million principal amount of notes issued by another gbcc subsidiary and held by hcc 
it was anticipated that hcc s primary method of collection with respect to the new notes would be through the utilization of existing tax net operating losses of the gbcc group 
as a result of hcc s distribution of gbcc stock  gbcc s tax net operating losses will no longer be available for utilization in hcc s consolidated tax returns  accordingly  hcc evaluated the collectability of the million ppi funding notes outstanding at december  based on i the planned utilization of million of such notes in connection with the acquisition from gbcc of the general partnership interest in the limited partnership which holds the aurora management contract see liquidity and capital resources hcc group financing activities below  ii management s intention  subject to the approval of the independent directors of gbcc  to utilize additional notes to acquire other assets from gbcc  and iii an evaluation of the future prospects for repayment based on cash flow projections and other available information  hcc established a valuation allowance in the amount of million at december  to adjust the carrying amount of the ppi funding notes to their estimated realizable value 
income tax provision benefit hcc and its subsidiaries have tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s totaling approximately million  none of which begin to expire until the year additionally  hcc and its subsidiaries have various tax credits available totaling approximately  which do not begin to expire until the year based on the operating results of the aurora casino and the tunica casino since commencement of their operations  management believes that it is more likely than not that future consolidated taxable income will be sufficient to utilize at least a portion of the nol s  tax credits and other deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
accordingly  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the consolidated balance sheets reflect the recording of a net deferred tax asset of million as of december  subject to a change of control as discussed below not occurring  the ultimate recognition of this amount of deferred tax assets will be dependent on hcc and its subsidiaries ability to generate approximately million of taxable income for federal tax purposes prior to the expiration dates of the nol s and tax credit carryforwards and the reversal of other temporary differences 
net operating loss carryforwards sales by hcc or existing stockholders of common stock by a five percent stockholder  as defined in the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  can cause a change of control  as defined in section of the code  which would limit the ability of hcc or its subsidiaries to utilize these loss carryforwards in later tax periods 
should such a change of control occur  the amount of loss carryforwards available for use in any one year would most likely be substantially reduced 
future treasury regulations  administrative rulings or court decisions may also effect hcc s future utilization of its loss carryforwards 
extraordinary item during october  hcc completed the refinancing of million of senior notes as well as other debt incurred in connection with the construction of the tunica casino 
as a result  costs and fees incurred  together with the write off of unamortized transaction costs  resulted in the recording of an extraordinary item in the amount of million in inflation management believes that in the near term  modest inflation  together with increased competition within the gaming industry for qualified and experienced personnel  will continue to cause increases in operating expenses  particularly labor and employee benefits costs 
seasonality historically  the sands operations have been highly seasonal in nature  with the peak activity occurring from may to september 
consequently  the results of hcc s operations for the first and fourth quarters have traditionally been less profitable than the other quarters of the fiscal year 
furthermore  the aurora casino has also experienced seasonality  but to a lesser degree than the sands  and management believes that seasonality may also cause fluctuations in reported results at the tunica casino 
in addition  the operations of the aurora casino  the tunica casino  and the sands may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including chance 
such seasonality and fluctuations may materially affect hcc s casino revenues and overall profitability 
liquidity and capital resources since their openings on june  and august   respectively  the aurora casino and the tunica casino have become the principal sources of liquidity and capital resources for hcc 
prior to the commencement of operations of the aurora facility  hcc s principal business activities were limited to its approximate ownership of gbcc 
gbcc s principal sources of liquidity and capital resources for the last several years have been cash flow from the sands  proceeds from debt financings and proceeds from asset sales 
hcc group operating activities the operations of the aurora casino continue to be the hcc group s primary source of liquidity and capital resources  having contributed approximately million of cash flow from operations during after deducting the payment of million of management fees to the gbcc group 
the tunica casino provided million of cash from operations during after deducting the payment of million of consulting fees to the gbcc group 
the hcc group s other sources of funds have included the repayment of principal and interest on intercompany loans made to the gbcc group and interest income earned on temporary investments 
in addition to operating expenses at the aurora casino and the tunica casino  uses of operating cash by the hcc group included interest payments on the senior notes million  costs to pursue development opportunities million and corporate overhead costs million 
during  cash flow from operations  together with existing cash  million in debt financing and the repayment of million of indebtedness from the gbcc group were used by the hcc group to fund capital expenditures of approximately million  to repay third party indebtedness of approximately million and to make payments under capital lease obligations of million
