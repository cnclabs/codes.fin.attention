item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this filing contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  loan demand  deposit withdrawals  interest rates  particularly the spread between loan rates and deposit rates  the effect of the southern california economy and real estate values  and other general business risks 
financial condition total interest earning assets increased approximately  from december  to the company is focusing efforts on increasing its loan base with quality loans 
interest earning assets decreased approximately  from december  to in deposits increased approximately  the increase was invested primarily in loans and federal funds sold 
the company has been increasing its investment in securities from to average balances have increased  in and  in the reason for the increase is due to an increase in deposits and relative soft loan demand 
the company believes securities are the best available investment after its liquidity needs are met through cash and due from banks and federal funds sold 
generally  mortgage backed securities are classified as held to maturity and us treasury and agency securities are classified as available for sale 
the market values of securities increased in due to a decline in interest rates late in the year 
in the market values of securities decreased slightly due to a small increase in short term interest rates during the year 
loans increased in compared to a decrease of in the supply of high quality loans continues to be soft in the southern california area 
bank premises and equipment  net of depreciation  decreased by  in and increased  in the company purchased approximately  in equipment in and  in the level of capital expenditures in the future is not expected to be substantially higher than expenditures 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into deferred compensation agreements with certain officers and directors 
these agreements provide a death benefit prior to retirement 
the company also invested  in life insurance policies in conjunction with these agreements 
the company does not anticipate any substantial purchases of life insurance in the future 
total deposits increased in compared to a decrease of in in the bank had a deposit relationship with a company that administered pension funds 
deposits from the company were approximately  as of december  in the fourth quarter of the company was sold and the accounts were closed 
without the loss of those deposits the increase in would have been greater 
deposit differences between the years fluctuate due to balances maintained by large depositors 
liquidity the company maintains substantial liquid and other short term assets to meet increases in loan demands  deposit withdrawals and maturities 
the loan to deposit ratio at december  was compared to at december  the ratio of liquid assets cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits at financial institutions  federal funds sold  and investments with maturities of one year or less to demand deposits was at december  compared to at december  the company may borrow funds under securities sold with agreements to repurchase for securities that have not been pledged 
at december  unpledged securities totaled approximately  all of the company s installment loans require monthly payments  which provide a steady return of cash funds 
liquidity needs can also be met through federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and or direct borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
the company has established federal funds borrowing lines with various banks up to  as of this date  the company has never used these facilities 
liquidity continued the subsidiary bank has a significant base of core deposits and has not used brokered deposits 
the bank also avoids using other wholesale  highly rate sensitive  short term funds and believes their deposits represent funding sources which are relatively stable with respect to liquidity 
as of december   the bank has deposit concentrations of  from five customers 
the company continues to meet its loan demands from its deposit base and with cash flow from operations 
if loan demand were to substantially increase  the company would be able to generate cash flow from its federal funds sold  sale of marketable securities which are available for sale  increasing deposits and borrowing on its established credit resources 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
capital management capital management requires that sufficient capital be maintained for anticipated growth and to provide depositors assurance that their funds are on deposit with a solvent institution 
the subsidiary bank has minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the parent company and subsidiary bank have similar capital requirements 
at december   minimum core capital is required to be of risk adjusted assets and minimum total capital is required to be 
the leverage ratio is required to be 
core capital for the bank under the regulations is defined as only stockholders equity and total capital is stockholders equity plus the allowance for credit losses 
leverage is the ratio of core capital to total average assets 
at december  core capital of the bank was  total capital was  the ratio of core and total capital to risk adjusted assets at december  was and  respectively 
the leverage ratio was at december  at december   the bank s capital ratios exceeded the well capitalized threshold prescribed in the rules of its principal federal regulator 
management believes that the company and its subsidiary are properly and adequately capitalized  as evidenced by these ratios and the strong liquidity position 
results of operations total interest income decreased in  and increased in the average yield decreased in by and increased in by 
the decrease in interest income in was due primarily to decreased rates 
the average rate decrease on loans in was 
the yield on loans will change along with the movements in the prime rate as approximately of the loan portfolio is based on variable rates 
the total average balances of interest earning assets increased approximately  in the average balance in loans decreased approximately  in and average balances in investment securities increased approximately  interest income from investment securities increased in due to the increase in the average balances of investment securities 
interest income from investment securities increased in due primarily to the increase in the average balances of investment securities 
the average balance in federal funds sold increased by  in interest income on federal funds sold increased by in and in the increase in was due to increased balances and the increase was primarily due to increased rates 
total interest expense increased in and in the increase in was due to a increase in the average rate paid and average interest bearing liabilities increasing by approximately  or 
the increase in was due to a 
increase in the average rate paid and average interest bearing liabilities increasing by approximately  or 
in  and the credit loss provisions were   and  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to provide for potential losses in the portfolio 
the economic outlook for cannot be predicted and  accordingly  future provisions for credit losses cannot be estimated at this time 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations continued other income decreased  in compared to an increase of  in 
the increase in was primarily due to increased gains on sale of loans 
other expenses decreased approximately  in this decrease was partially caused by a  decrease in salary and benefit costs due to a decrease in staff between and as a result of a reorganizational study in the second half of that continued into insurance expenses were down in due to a decrease in the cost of fdic insurance 
other real estate owned expenses are down in due to a decrease in the number of properties owned by the bank 
in  the company reduced its valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets by  compared to a  reduction in these reductions also reduced income tax expense 
income tax expense in reflects effective tax rates on taxable earnings which approximates the federal and state statutory tax rates of 
as of december   there is no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  therefore there is no expected reduction in tax expense in in the company had approximately  recorded as a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets which could reduce future income tax expense if the net assets become realizable 
in  management determined the valuation allowance was no longer necessary as the deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
accordingly  income tax expense is less than the amount computed at the federal statutory rate 
see footnote no 
to the financial statements 
the provisions in fasb statement no 
and the effect of alternative minimum tax have the potential for producing  under certain conditions  significant distortions in future income tax provisions and the effective tax rate 
net income in decreased approximately  over due primarily to a decrease in the average rate on interest earning assets 
net income increased approximately  over due primarily to an increase in the average rate paid on on interest earning assets and a  reduction in the tax expense 
while management is optimistic about the future  the effects of current economic conditions on the collectability of loans cannot be predicted with absolute certainty and its effects on future profitability cannot be determined 
off balance sheet analysis the contractual amounts associated with certain financial transactions are not recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
off balance sheet treatment is generally considered appropriate either where exchange of the underlying asset or liability has not occurred nor is assured  or where contractual amounts are used solely to determine cash flows to be exchanged 
off balance sheet financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
a majority of these commitments are with variable interest rates and therefore are not derivative instruments 
additional information about off balance sheet financial instruments is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity the company manages its balance sheet to minimize the impact of interest rate movements on its earnings 
the term rate sensitive refers to those assets and liabilities which are sensitive to fluctuations in rates and yields 
when interest rates move  earnings may be affected in many ways 
interest rates in assets and liabilities may change at different times or by different amounts 
maintaining a proper balance between rate sensitive earning assets and rate sensitive liabilities is the principal function of asset and liability management of a banking organization 
interest rate sensitivity continued the following table shows the repricing period for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the related repricing gap in thousands repricing period s omitted three months or over three months one year through over five years less through twelve five years months interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities repricing gap cumulative repricing gap cumulative gap as a percent of earning assets collateralized mortgage obligations are allocated to the one year to five year maturities based on the average expected lives 
the company has  in securities classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value 
the remaining securities of  are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
the held to maturity securities may be called or repaid without penalties 
the value of these securities is subject to fluctuation based upon current long term interest rates 
the company has approximately  of interest earning loans and federal funds sold and approximately  of interest bearing demand and savings deposits which are able to reprice overnight 
repricing gap equals total interest earning assets less total interest bearing liabilities available for repricing during a given time interval 
a positive repricing gap for a given period exists when total interest earning assets exceed total interest bearing liabilities and a negative repricing gap exists when total interest bearing liabilities are in excess of interest earning assets 
generally  a positive repricing gap will result in increased net interest income in a rising rate environment and decreased net interest income in a falling rate environment 
a negative repricing gap tends to produce increased net interest income in a falling rate environment and decreased net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the company s repricing gap indicates that it is positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflations 
impact of inflation and changing prices continued unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
in the current interest rate environment  the liquidity and the maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
effect of fasb statements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  which becomes effective for transactions occurring after december  the statement does not permit earlier or retroactive application 
the statement distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
a transferred assets of financial assets in which the transferor surrenders control over those assets is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
the statement also establishes standards on the initial recognition and measurement of servicing assets and other retained interests and servicing liabilities  and their subsequent measurement 
the statement requires that debtors reclassify financial assets pledged as collateral and that secured parties recognize those assets and their obligation to return them in certain circumstances in which the secured party has taken control of those assets 
in addition  the statement requires that a liability be derecognized only if the debtor is relieved of its obligation through payment to the creditor or by being legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability either judicially or by the creditor 
in december  fasb issued statement no 
which amended statement no 
by delaying the effective date of the statement no 
for one year for certain transactions 
management does not believe the application of the statements to transactions of the bank that have been typical in the past will materially affect the bank s financial position and results of operations
