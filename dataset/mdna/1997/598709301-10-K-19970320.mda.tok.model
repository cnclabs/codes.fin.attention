item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company operates in three business segments plastics machinery  machine tools and industrial products 
in the last three years  the company has achieved record sales in each succeeding year 
the sales increases have resulted principally from the growth of the plastics machinery and industrial products segments  largely as a result of three major acquisitions 
machine tool sales increased in  but decreased in due primarily to the sale of a division 
on january   the company acquired d m e  which is included in the company s plastics machinery segment for eleven months of this acquisition had the effect of increasing new orders and sales by approximately million in in  the company acquired two businesses widia in february and talbot in july 
both businesses are included in the industrial products segment 
the timing of these acquisitions caused an increase in new orders and sales in by approximately million 
on december   the company sold its electronic systems division esd  which was included in the machine tools segment 
while most of its sales were made to other milacron businesses  esd also contributed approximately million and million of new orders and sales  respectively  to external customers in esd s operating earnings were million in  and its disposition resulted in a gain of million before tax million after tax 
on january   the company sold its american mine tool amt business which was formerly part of the industrial products segment 
amt s new orders  sales and operating earnings in were immaterial  but its disposition resulted in a gain of million before tax million after tax in presence outside the us because of the company s recent acquisitions  as well as the company s internal growth in non us markets  over of sales and segment earnings are now being generated outside the us foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of these sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
however  the company s major foreign operations are in european countries which have not experienced significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in recent years 
in  the financial statement effects of a weaker german mark were in large part offset by the effects of a stronger british pound 
as a result  the company experienced a translation effect of decreasing new orders by million  sales by million and net earnings by million 
in addition  in there was a million decrease in shareholders equity due to cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments 
a further strengthening of the us dollar would have a negative effect on translating the company s operating results 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders for were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures  new orders decreased by million  which approximates the decline caused by changes in currency exchange rates 
orders for plastics machinery increased million 
excluding the effects of the d m e acquisition  however  new orders for plastics machinery declined by million  or  due primarily to weaker order levels for injection molding machines in the us in the first half of machine tool orders totaled million  virtually unchanged from level 
however  after excluding the effect of the esd divestiture  new orders for machine tools increased million  or  largely due to increased orders for uk built standard machine tools and us built aerospace products 
this segment experienced reduced orders for us built standard machine tools throughout much of the year  but orders improved in the fourth quarter 
orders for industrial products were million 
after excluding the effect of the talbot and widia acquisitions  new orders for industrial products declined million  or  due primarily to the weakening german mark throughout the year  and a weakening of the market for european cutting tools and industrial magnets in the last half of us export orders increased to million in  up over from due primarily to the d m e acquisition 
at december   the backlog of unfilled orders was million  up from million at december  the increase relates primarily to increased orders for us built machine tools  including aerospace products 
sales sales in were  million  which represented an million  or  increase over the increase was caused primarily by the d m e acquisition 
excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures  sales decreased by approximately million  of which million was due to the effect of currency translation adjustments 
sales of plastics machinery increased by million 
excluding the effects of the d m e acquisition  however  sales of plastics machinery declined by million  or  due primarily to weaker orders for us built injection molding machines in the first half of and european built injection molding machines throughout the year 
machine tool sales declined million 
after excluding the esd divestiture effect  however  sales for machine tools declined million  or  due to reduced sales of us built standard machine tools  in part offset by increased sales of uk built standard machine tools and us built aerospace products 
industrial products sales increased  although after excluding the acquisitions  sales declined million  or  due to currency translation effects and the weakening european market described above 
sales of all segments to non us markets totaled million  an increase in of million  and export sales totaled million  an increase of million 
the increases resulted primarily from the d m e acquisition 
in both and  products manufactured outside the us approximated of sales while products sold outside the us approximated of sales 
margins  costs and expenses manufacturing margins  as a percent to sales  were in both and  however  excluding esd s margins from  the ongoing business margins increased from in to in plastics machinery margins increased in the us despite continued price pressures  but declined in germany due to temporary excess staffing levels 
machine tool margins also increased  after excluding esd s margins from results 
industrial products margins improved for the year but declined in the fourth quarter due to reduced sales volume in widia s european businesses 
selling and administrative expense increased in due to the d m e acquisition and increased sales 
as a percent to sales  however  selling expense continued to approximate of sales and administrative expense continued to approximate of sales 
the expense for minority shareholders interests in earnings of subsidiaries relates principally to widia s subsidiary in india 
the increased expense reflects a offset to the subsidiary s improved profitability 
other net declined in to 
million from million in due to reduced costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable  increased gains on sales of fixed assets  favorable settlement of legal claims and other similar items which may not recur in the future 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in compared to million in the expense increase was primarily attributable to the temporary use of debt to fund the d m e acquisition 
this debt was later repaid from the proceeds of the equity offering described below and  accordingly  interest expense declined during the second half of the year 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in  and includes us federal and state and local income taxes  and income taxes in other jurisdictions outside the us the company entered all three years with sizeable net operating loss nol carryforwards  along with valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions against the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
by december   the company had fully utilized its us nol carryforwards  but as of december   its non us nol carryforwards totaled million  most of which have no expiration dates 
the company s practice is to periodically reevaluate the future realization of all of its deferred tax assets 
during and  the company concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of these assets will be offset against future taxable income 
as a result  the company reversed valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions which caused the provision for income taxes to be less than the statutory rate 
the company expects the utilization of these nol carryforwards and reversal of additional valuation allowances to continue to cause the effective tax rate to be less than the us statutory rate through at least  and most likely through earnings net earnings in were million  or per share  compared with million  or per share in the net earnings included million  or per share  resulting from the combined effects of the gain on the disposition of two businesses  offset by the integration charge  both of which are described below 
excluding those items  net earnings increased by million  or  while per share earnings increased by  or  which also includes the effect of an increase in outstanding common shares 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders for were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over of the million increase  million resulted from the widia and talbot acquisitions 
orders for plastics machinery increased million  or  primarily due to increased orders for german built injection molding machines 
although the segment experienced increased orders for the year  new business in the fourth quarter decreased compared to the exceptionally strong order level in the fourth quarter of machine tool orders increased in by million  or  as all major uk and uk product lines  including aerospace products  showed increases 
machine tool orders in the fourth quarter of were million  up over the fourth quarter of  however  the million was not as strong as earlier quarters 
this decline affected sales in the first quarter of orders for industrial products  excluding the acquisitions  increased by million  or  primarily as a result of increased industrial activity in the us and europe 
us export orders approximated million in compared to million in this represents a increase  which was primarily attributable to increased machine tool orders from european customers 
at december   the backlog of unfilled orders was million 
this figure was reduced by esd s backlog of unfilled orders from non milacron customers as a result of the esd sale in december  despite this reduction  the backlog increased in by million  primarily as a result of the widia acquisition 
sales sales in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase over of the million increase  million represented sales from the acquisitions  widia and talbot 
the rest of the increase was attributable to a million  or  increase in sales of plastics machinery resulting primarily from growth in the company s european injection molding and extrusion businesses  a million  or  increase in sales of machine tools resulting primarily from increased sales of uk built vertical machining centers  and excluding the acquisitions  a million  or  increase in industrial products sales due to increased sales of all businesses cutting fluids  grinding wheels and valenite cutting tools 
sales of all segments to non us markets totaled million  an increase in of million primarily due to the widia acquisition 
export sales totaled million  an increase of million  or  primarily due to increased sales of machine tools in europe 
in  products manufactured outside the us constituted of consolidated sales as compared to in  while products sold outside the us were approximately of consolidated sales as compared to in margins  costs and expenses manufacturing margins increased to in compared to in  due primarily to the increased proportion of industrial products sales which have higher margins than the machinery businesses 
plastics machinery margins were unchanged for the year although they were lower in the last half of  largely due to increased exports and reduced automotive sales 
machine tools experienced a slight decline largely due to phasing out some older product lines 
industrial products margins declined slightly because of the mix of product sales 
selling and administrative expense increased due to the acquisitions and increased sales 
as a percent to sales  selling expense increased from to due to the higher proportion of industrial products sales which have higher selling costs 
administrative expense increased because the administrative costs of the newly acquired subsidiaries exceeded a reduction in corporate overhead expenses  although the total was slightly less than of sales 
the million gain on disposition of businesses resulted from the million before tax gain on the sale of esd  which was sold in the fourth quarter of  and the million before tax gain on the sale of amt  which was sold in the first quarter of these transactions had the effect of increasing net earnings by million  or per share 
the esd sale had the effect of reducing operating results by the amount of esd s sales to non milacron customers and its before tax operating profit which totaled million and million  respectively  in however  the proceeds from the sale were used to repay bank borrowings and to partially fund the d m e acquisition which increased earnings 
the million pretax integration charge million after tax relates to the company s february  acquisition of widia 
the widia acquisition allows the company to capitalize on synergistic opportunities with valenite  an existing subsidiary which manufactures similar products 
accordingly  in may   management formally approved a plan to integrate certain operations of these businesses at an expected cost of million  which was increased to million in december   to include additional actions at widia 
that portion of the cost directly related to widia  totaling million  was recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment  while the remaining million  which is directly related to valenite  was recorded as a charge to earnings 
the million plan involved the closing or downsizing of three manufacturing plants and the consolidation of numerous sales  service and warehouse operations in europe and asia 
the million integration charge included million for severance and other termination benefits and million for facility exit costs and asset write downs 
as a result of the actions included in the million plan  which began in and were substantially completed in the first half of except for certain personnel reductions at widia  the company is achieving annual cost savings in excess of million 
the total cash cost of million was funded by operations and bank borrowings 
other net increased by million due to a million increase in financing fees on the sale of receivables  as well as the effects of the acquisitions 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in compared to million in the primary cause of the increase was higher borrowing levels to support the widia and talbot acquisitions 
earnings net earnings in were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the net earnings in included million  or per share  resulting from the combined effects of the gain on the disposition of two businesses  offset by the integration charge 
excluding these items  net earnings increased by million  or 
per share 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million during the year 
the decrease was caused primarily by the d m e acquisition  offset in part by the proceeds from the equity offering described below 
operating activities provided million in  compared with million provided in operating activities cash flows have been reduced by cash costs of million in for the widia valenite integration and restructuring  and million in for the integration and the machine tool consolidation 
investing activities in resulted in a million use of cash  mostly due to the d m e acquisition  as well as million of capital expenditures 
net cash used by investing activities in includes million for the widia acquisition and million for the talbot acquisition 
also affecting was million provided from the divestitures of esd and amt 
financing activities provided million of cash in  primarily due to million of net proceeds from the issuance of million additional shares of common stock 
in  financing activities provided million of cash  primarily due to the issuance of million of notes 
as of december   the company s current ratio was  down from at december  at december   the company had lines of credit with various us and us banks of approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility 
the facility imposes a number of restrictions  including restrictions on total indebtedness in relation to total capital 
the company has remained in compliance with the restrictions imposed by the facility since its inception 
under the provisions of the facility  the company s additional borrowing capacity totaled approximately million at december  the company had a number of short term intercompany loans and advances denominated in various currencies totaling million at december   that were subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company also enters into various transactions  in the ordinary course of business  for the purchase and sale of goods and services in various currencies 
the company hedges its exposure to currency fluctuations related to short term intercompany loans and advances and the purchase and sale of goods under firm commitments by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company is currently not involved with any additional derivative financial instruments 
the interest rates on the lines of credit and the financing fees on the receivables purchase agreement fluctuate based on changes in prevailing interest rates in the countries in which amounts are borrowed or receivables are sold 
at december   approximately million was subject to the effects of fluctuations in interest rates under these arrangements 
future changes in interest rates will affect the company s interest expense and other financing costs 
total debt was million at december   an increase of million over december   primarily as a result of the d m e acquisition 
total shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million over december   primarily due to the sale of additional common shares  as well as the net earnings in as a result  the ratio of total debt to total capital debt plus equity improved to at december   from at december  in  the company anticipates repurchasing  to  shares of the company s common stock on the open market to meet the needs of management incentive  employee benefit and dividend reinvestment plans 
in addition  capital expenditures are expected to range between million and million  dependent upon the timing of certain projects 
in the first quarter of  the company plans to implement a cost cutting program to reduce staffing at ferromatik in germany resulting in a million cash expense 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and available credit lines will be sufficient to meet these and other operating requirements 
outlook the company expects net earnings in the first quarter of to be a little below year ago levels due to the expense associated with the german cost cutting program 
on an annual basis  the company has set average annual growth targets of to in sales and or more in earnings per share 
assuming  among other things  that the european economy does not worsen significantly  the company believes these financial targets are attainable in the above forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results  as described more fully in the cautionary statement below
