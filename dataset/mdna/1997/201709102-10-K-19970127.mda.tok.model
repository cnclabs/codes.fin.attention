item continued consolidated results continued the spin off of cuno has been reflected as a discontinued operation by the company 
continuing operations include the company s remaining hydraulics systems and building systems and metal products segments 
the remaining discussion relates to the company s continuing operations and excludes cuno s historical results 
during the third quarter of  the company received an unsolicited tender offer from united dominion industries  ltd  which the board of directors voted unanimously as inadequate and confirmed the company s strategic plan to spin off to shareholders percent of its wholly owned cuno incorporated filtration subsidiary 
in addition  the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million common shares 
the cost of million associated with the successful defense against the hostile takeover attempt and the cost to further reorganize the remaining core businesses of the company are recorded as nonrecurring defense and reorganization costs 
softness in the us economy offset with improved business conditions in europe and the united kingdom resulted in improved sales and earnings after adjusting for nonrecurring defense and reorganization costs 
income from continuing operations before extraordinary items of million was nearly identical to last year s income of million and percent higher than after adjusting for the million net of income taxes nonrecurring charges 
results in included an after tax charge of million to close and consolidate certain operations in europe 
net income of million in includes a million noncash gain from the reversal of tax accruals no longer required in connection with a discontinued operation 
item continued consolidated results continued consolidated sales of million were higher than those in and by percent and percent  respectively  after adjusting for the effects of exchange rate differences on foreign sales reported in us dollars 
most of the three year improvement resulted from increased volume as price increases have been relatively modest during the period 
revenues of the corporation s us operations decreased slightly as the economy softened during the latter half of fiscal following an all time high of million in  but surpassed those in by percent 
domestic operations accounted for percent of the company s total sales in versus percent in and percent in revenues for the company s overseas operations increased by percent over those in on a parity adjusted basis 
most of the year over year gain occurred in the united kingdom reflecting increased demand for the company s products serving that region 
sales were generally higher in europe and australia but lower in brazil as business conditions were flat in these regions 
operating income of million was lower than and by percent and percent  respectively  before adjusting for the million nonrecurring defense and reorganization costs incurred in operating income before the nonrecurring charges was million compared to million in and million in operating income decreased by percent for the hydraulic systems group following four consecutive years of advances  while increasing by percent in the building systems and metal products group 
domestic metal stamping divisions improved for the second consecutive year and the astron division in europe also reported significant improvements over and item continued consolidated results continued included in operating income for the three years are the financial results of the orsta hydraulik operations which were acquired in shares of orsta hydraulik were acquired from the former treuhandanstalt tha  the regulatory agency of the federal republic of germany responsible for the privatization of former east german state owned enterprises 
under terms of the purchase agreement  commercial intertech tendered no financial consideration to acquire the shares received 
in addition to the net assets of the companies  cash contributions were received from the tha to fund pre existing capital investment programs and cover estimated operating losses over a period of two years 
the loss indemnification was recorded as a deferred credit negative goodwill and was amortized to income through cost of products sold in accordance with a predetermined schedule of projected losses in each fiscal quarter over the two year period 
the combined german operations represented by this acquisition incurred operating losses of million in  after amortization of the deferred credit  on sales of million and losses of million after amortization of the deferred credit in on sales of million 
the impact on operating income in was negligible see note k for further details 
following the acquisition of orsta hydraulik during the latter half of  the company announced strategic plans to close certain hydraulic facilities in europe  phase out some nonperforming products manufactured at those facilities  and consolidate the remaining core businesses with the orsta operation in germany and other existing operations located in the united kingdom 
included in cost of products sold for were charges of million for the separation of employees  closure of facilities  writedown of unrecoverable fixed assets  and other incremental costs necessary to complete this consolidation effort 
the program was executed in phases with two out of three segments being completed during and the final phase completed in this program will improve the corporation s operating results over time through reduced employment costs  more effective utilization of plant and equipment  and lower depreciation expense 
item continued industry segments hydraulic systems the hydraulic systems segment accounted for percent of the company s total sales and percent of total operating income excluding the nonrecurring charges in revenues in this segment increased by million or percent over last year  while operating income as reported was lower by million 
most of the erosion occurred in the domestic units as the prolonged softness in demand from key industry segments lasted almost the entire fiscal year 
revenues remained flat during the year  however income suffered from higher material costs  expenses to re engineer manufacturing processes and administrative systems  and the costs incurred to develop and launch a range of fluid power components for the automotive industry 
the us cylinder division and oildyne  a manufacturer of miniature hydraulic systems  reported significant increases during the fourth quarter of in revenues and operating income compared with the corresponding period last year 
financial performance was favorable in the foreign segment during while results were flat except in the united kingdom which reported strong demand for their products 
the operations in germany reported improved revenue in compared to but reported a combined operating loss of million for the year 
improvements in efficiencies and productivity has been slower than expected  and operating results were further reduced by the start up costs incurred in moving into the new cylinder facility and the sluggish economy in europe 
item continued industry segments continued in june of  the hydraulics systems group reported it acquired the assets of component engineering company  a manufacturer of cartridge type hydraulic valves which are manifold mounted for both mobile and industrial applications 
the manifold style valves complement the company s existing lines of stack type valves 
subsequent to the year end  the hydraulic group also announced the stock purchase of ultra hydraulics limited located near gloucester  england  by its wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom 
ultra hydraulics serves the mobile equipment market in the united kingdom  europe  the united states and the far east 
major customers include manufacturers of material handling  turf care  construction  transportation and compaction equipment 
ultra s products complement and extend the range of pumps  motors and valves now offered by the company 
capital expenditures amounted to million for this segment in versus expenditures of million in and million in included in the total for the current year are expenditures of million for completion of a new cylinder facility in the united states as well as million for part of the plant expansion for the valve facility in hicksville  ohio  and expenditures of million for the continuing upgrades at our facilities located in germany 
funding for most of these german projects was provided by the tha in accordance with the terms of the purchase 
the majority of the remaining expenditures in pertain to ongoing equipment purchases in the us to upgrade manufacturing performance and to outfit specialized machining cells for the manufacture of new products 
incoming orders for the hydraulic systems group ended the year even with the backlog of unfilled orders to start the new fiscal year was about the same as last year  after adjusting for currency differences 
item continued building systems and metal products the revenues were down slightly for this group in compared to  but percent higher than operating income improved by percent over and by percent over as the overseas rebounded near the end of sales for the astron division were higher than last year by percent on a parity adjusted basis  but earnings improved significantly following three years of continued decline 
increased pricing of products  lower operating costs at the satellite manufacturing operation in the czech republic and increased demand for our products were the main reason for the improvement 
sales were percent lower than but percent higher than for the metal stamping division in the us however  results remained at the same level as the continued strong demand comes from the transportation and home building industries 
sales were enhanced in and by the acquisition of a small manufacturer of large diameter steel heads located in saginaw  texas 
the division s distribution center program  which has six locations in the us continued strong performance in operating income for the combined metal stamping operations in the us was higher than and by percent and percent  respectively 
capital expenditures for this segment amounted to million in versus million in and million in nearly two thirds of the expenditures pertained to upgrade production equipment  equipment for the satellite facility in the czech republic  and other office automation for the astron division 
the balance of the spending in related to upgrades and replacement of production equipment in the us general upgrades of astron s facilities and production capabilities accounted for the majority of the capital expenditures in and item continued industry segments continued incoming orders for domestic operations were higher in the fourth quarter of compared to last year reflecting a somewhat stronger economy 
the astron division also reported good bookings in the fourth quarter  but somewhat lower than in which included one large order shipped in early the backlog of unfilled orders to start the new year is lower by percent from a year ago in the us  while the astron backlog is off percent after adjusting for foreign currency differences 
nonoperating income and expense interest received from investments decreased from million in to million in  due primarily  to available funds used to support the repurchase of common stock and to successfully defend against a hostile takeover attempt 
investment yields were marginally higher than those in previous periods 
approximately percent of total interest expense incurred on borrowed funds in resulted from long term obligations 
most of the long term interest expense derived from the issuance of million of percent senior notes as part of a capital restructuring program 
the senior notes were refinanced during the fourth quarter of with a bridge facility that also funded the company s program to repurchase million common shares 
the interest on this new bridge financing was percent 
remaining interest expense primarily pertains to long term debt to fund major construction projects  equipment leases  and short term borrowings to support current operations 
recorded as a credit to interest expense in is a million reversal of an unrealized interest obligation accrued in prior years 
effective interest rates paid by the company on long term debt have increased slightly over the three year period  primarily due to the bridge financing incurred during the fourth quarter of short term rates have fluctuated on an interim basis 
item continued nonoperating income and expense continued foreign currency exchange and translation gains and losses are included in other nonoperating expense 
these amounts totaled million gain in  and losses of million in and million in the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the principal and interest due on loans which are periodically made with foreign subsidiaries 
deferred gains and losses from such hedging activities were negligible at the end of the current fiscal year see note j 
other nonoperating income for includes million gain on the sale of fixed assets 
the unused assets were principally located in the united kingdom and germany 
taxes the company s effective tax rate increased to percent in compared to percent in primarily as the result of nonrecurring defense costs in and reduced utilization of tax loss carryforwards acquired with the orsta business in to shelter earnings of the company s other german operations  including those of an astron subsidiary 
remaining orsta net operating losses of approximately million  may be carried forward indefinitely and are expected to provide tax relief on income earned by all operations in germany for a number of years 
effective rates are also reduced by the favorable tax impact of reserve contracts and the exercise of stock options 
partially offsetting these benefits were the tax consequences of repatriating foreign earnings and state and local taxes levied on domestic income 
extraordinary items the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million during the fourth quarter of for losses associated with early retirements of debt 
item continued accounting standards in october  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
the sop does not make changes to existing accounting rules  but it clarifies how existing authoritative guidance on loss contingencies should be applied in determining environmental liabilities 
the company does not believe the sop will have any material impact on future operations 
the company will be required to report under the sop in financial statements for in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation governing financial accounting and reporting standards for compensation plans which award employees in the form of stock options  restricted stock  performance shares  etc 
as permitted by this statement  the company intends to continue to account for such compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
adoption of the new standard in this form will have no impact of reported income in future years 
pro forma disclosures as required by this pronouncement will apply to stock based awards on or after november  and will first be disclosed in financial statements for item continued liquidity and capital resources liquidity is generally defined as the ability to generate cash  by whatever means available  to satisfy the short and long term needs of the company 
with respect to cash flow in  the balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of  after adjusting for the percent spin off of cuno incorporated as a discontinued operation 
the orsta acquisition made in continues to be a consumer of company funds 
under terms of the orsta purchase agreement  commercial intertech received cash contributions from the tha and other german regulatory agencies to cover operating losses for a period of two years and fund pre existing capital expenditures programs of the acquired businesses see note k 
contributions received since the acquisition date in accordance with the agreement have aggregated to million in and  while cash consumed for operating requirements inclusive of working capital needs and capital investments has amounted to million and million  respectively 
the orsta operations generated a net cash flow of million in but consumed million in and million in cash generated from commercial intertech s total continuing operations amounted to million in  representing an increase of million from the previous year 
a decrease in accounts receivable and a reduced amount of deferred credit amortization were the principal factors in the year over year increase 
income from discontinued operations and amortization of deferred credit are noncash in nature and therefore had no effect on cash flow in these periods 
item continued liquidity and capital resources continued cash used in investing activities amounted to million in capital expenditures totaled million for the year versus million in and million in see note i 
more than percent of the current year spending pertained to expansion of production capacity  equipment upgrades to improve manufacturing performance  machine tools for the manufacture of new product introductions  construction of a new manufacturing facility  and purchase of advanced computer systems to support manufacturing processes and administrative functions 
completion of a new manufacturing facility  investments in technologically advanced production equipment  and other operating improvements for the orsta units accounted for most of the capital spending overseas during and production equipment for the new astron satellite facility in the czech republic accounted for part of the overseas expenditures 
construction of a new manufacturing facility  capacity expansion  equipment upgrades  and office automation in the us accounted for the majority of the capital expenditures in the two preceding years 
authorized but unspent capital expenditure programs totaled million at october  major projects include the completion of the new valve plant expansion  on going state of the art production equipment for the hydraulic group  upgraded production equipment to improve efficiency and increase capacity for the metal products group 
proceeds were received during from the sale of idle property and equipment located in the united kingdom and germany 
cash used in financing activities totaled million 
principal activities included the refinancing of the company s debt during the hostile takeover attempt by obtaining bridge financing to fund the repurchase of million common shares  to purchase the esop senior notes  and to retire the million senior notes that were outstanding 
the bridge financing was replaced with a new million senior revolving credit and million term loan facilities 
other activities include the payment of reserve contract premiums  losses on early retirements of debt  dividend from cuno incorporated in connection with the spin off  and the distribution of dividends to shareholders 
dividends totaled million in  of which million were paid to shareholders of common stock 
item continued liquidity and capital resources continued as part of a restructuring program completed in  the company established two leveraged employee stock ownership plans the esops and sold series b cumulative preferred shares to the plans for approximately million 
the esops borrowed funds to purchase the series b shares 
during  the esops completed a refinancing program whereby a floating rate loan was replaced with a million  percent  year term loan privately placed with a group of insurance companies 
during  the company purchased the outstanding loan from the group 
this program provides permanent financing for the remaining life of the benefit plan 
in november  the company reported it acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ultra hydraulics limited through its wholly owned subsidiary  commercial intertech limited  located in the united kingdom 
ultra hydraulics is headquartered near gloucester  england and employs more than men and women in the united kingdom and the united states 
commercial intertech will account for the stock acquisition of ultra as a purchase 
the initial purchase price of ultra is approximately million and is subject to adjustments based upon audit 
the funds were provided as part of the new senior revolving credit and term loan agreement entered into at the end of october  internal cash flows are expected to be sufficient to provide the capital resources necessary to support operating needs and finance capital expenditure programs in the coming year 
the company has a million excluding the funds related to the purchase of ultra hydraulics limited credit facility available which expires in the funds available to the company under this agreement may be used for any general corporate purpose 
including this facility  total credit lines of million  denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies  were available to the company at fiscal year end 
borrowing rates to start the new year were generally lower than the same period a year ago  reflecting prevailing market conditions 
item continued impact of inflation and changing prices rates of inflation were approximately the same as the previous year  ranging from to percent in most instances 
manufacturing and operating costs generally advanced in line with inflation  but the continuing trend of competitive pressures and price resistance in the marketplace limited the extent to which cost increases could be passed along to customers in selling price increases were implemented to cover rising costs for wages  benefits  raw materials  purchased components and other manufacturing costs 
consequently  the corporation relied upon volumetric efficiencies  productivity improvements and cost saving measures to offset the shortfall in pricing and successfully maintain or improve profit margins in most business units 
margins improved for the astron division where weak industry prices and price discounting in certain market segments have adversely affected profitability over the previous two years 
the ability to recover cost increases and maintain margins continues to be a major challenge for most operating units  and the company relies upon cost containment  aggressive purchasing  quality initiatives and cost saving capital investments to combat profit erosion and remain competitive 
business outlook the consolidated backlog of unfilled orders amounted to million at the end of the year which  after adjusting for the effects of exchange rate differences on foreign segments  represents a decrease of percent over the previous fiscal year end 
substantially all of the consolidated backlog is deliverable in item continued business outlook continued business conditions to start the new fiscal year for the company s domestic operations are uneven but early signs indicate that demand will increase in most of our core product lines for recent reports suggest that economic growth in the us will continue as consumer confidences are high and interest rates remain low 
first quarter earnings for the company s domestic operations are expected to be seasonally lower  but profit improvements are anticipated for the entire year 
the company intends to realize benefits from major capital investments to improve productivity and also stands to benefit from the added business volume of the recent acquisitions of component engineering and ultra hydraulics 
the production inefficiencies and development costs associated with start ups of a number of new hydraulic products  including small displacement pumps  pressure compensated valves  and the introduction of a new line of piston pumps  are now behind us 
these new products  all of which enhance our competitive position and open new markets to us  as well as the continued growth in miniature and specialized hydraulics  are expected to contribute to improved results 
prospects are mixed for the company s overseas operations to start the year 
ongoing efforts to reorganize and make profitable the hydraulic operations in germany will continue to adversely impact earnings early in the new year  but significant improvements are expected in from strengthening of market conditions  additional volume from new product introduction  and successful negotiations with agencies of the german government to extend operating subsidies for one of the business units acquired from the former treuhandanstalt tha in conditions are brighter for the astron division as demand is expected to increase in major european markets  with particular strength in eastern europe 
pricing should remain similar to the level of while manufacturing costs will hold steady as a result of full manufacturing status at the czech republic facility and continuation of a favorable trend in material costs 
elsewhere  the outlook is excellent for continued economic growth in the united kingdom  coupled with the new acquisition of ultra hydraulics 
continued growth is again expected in australia and brazil 
item continued business outlook continued the company continues to invest in capital improvements  identify and implement strategic initiatives  and reduce overheads where possible to lower operating costs and improve profitability 
the competitive advantages which these programs provide  our ability to meet the challenges of globalization and increased international competition  and continuation of moderate growth in world economies cause us to anticipate strong consolidated results again in forward looking information because commercial intertech wants to provide shareholders with more meaningful and useful information  this annual report contains certain statements which reflect the company s current expectations regarding the future results of operations  performance and achievements
