overview the company is engaged in the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of stent systems and ptca balloon catheters designed to be utilized in connection with less invasive treatment of atherosclerosis 
the company began commercial sales of its ptca balloon catheters in october  its coronary stent systems in october and its peripheral stent systems in december the company s products are currently commercially sold only outside of the united states  primarily in europe and japan 
in april  the company began its first direct sales operation in europe  and currently it has direct operations in each of france  germany  the netherlands to service the benelux countries  switzerland and the united kingdom 
in japan  the company currently sells only balloon catheters 
in june  the company s japanese distributor received regulatory approval for the sale in japan of the company s coronary stent systems  however  as of the date hereof  such distributor had not yet received the related reimbursement approval 
the company does not expect reimbursement approval in japan prior to november  and there can be no assurance when or if such approval will be obtained 
in august  the company submitted a pma to the fda in connection with its ongoing efforts to gain approval to begin commercial sales of its coronary stent systems in the united states 
clinical studies under an ide are ongoing with certain of the company s products 
the company does not expect fda approval of its stent systems for sale in the united states prior to  and there can be no assurance when or if such approval will be obtained 
as a result  the company expects international sales to account for substantially all of its revenues until at least the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  substantial clinical research and other costs in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals for its stent systems in the united states and other countries 
the company has a limited history of operations 
the increase in the company s sales to date has been due to greater demand for the company s stent systems and  to a lesser degree  its ptca balloon catheter systems 
the company believes that it is currently one of the leading providers of stent systems internationally 
in order to support increased levels of sales in the future and to augment its long term competitive position  the company anticipates that it will be required to make continuing significant additional expenditures in manufacturing  research and development including clinical study and regulatory costs  sales and marketing and administration  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
the company has also experienced higher administrative expenses resulting from its obligations as a public reporting company 
until april  substantially all of the company s sales were to international distributors who resell products to health care providers 
the company terminated its relationship with distributors in germany and the united kingdom in april and may  respectively  and in france  switzerland  belgium and the netherlands effective september  the company believes that the establishment and maintenance of direct sales forces in france  germany  the netherlands to service the benelux countries  switzerland and the united kingdom has resulted in increased revenues and market share in those territories 
the establishment and maintenance of direct sales forces has required and will continue to require significant ongoing expenditures  additional management resources and has resulted  and may continue to result  in additional costs to eliminate existing distributor relationships including litigation by former distributors 
see item legal proceedings 
generally  the company manufactures and ships product shortly after the receipt of orders  and it anticipates that it will do so in the future 
the company developed a significant short term backlog during january in connection with the scale up of manufacturing of its gfx stent product 
this backlog was significantly reduced during the same fiscal quarter in which it arose 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in scaling up production of new products or that it will not experience manufacturing difficulties in the future 
the company anticipates that its results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including variations in operating expenses  the costs and the outcome of litigation  competition including pricing pressures  costs and the timing of establishing direct sales operations  the timing of research and development expenses including clinical trial related expenditures  the timing of new product introductions or transitions to new products  sales by distributors  the mix of sales among distributors and the company s direct sales force  timing of regulatory and third party reimbursement approvals  the level of third party reimbursement  the company s ability to manufacture its products efficiently  and seasonal factors impacting the number of elective angioplasty procedures 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be affected by the timing of orders from distributors  changes in the company s distributor network including expenses in connection with termination of former distributors  the ability of the company s distributors to effectively promote the company s products and the ability of the company to quickly and cost effectively establish or maintain and manage an effective direct sales force in targeted countries 
the company s limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
although the company has experienced growth in recent years  there can be no assurance that  in the future  the company will sustain revenue growth or remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis or that its growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
the company has experienced  and may experience in one or more future quarters  operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock has been  and would likely be  materially and adversely affected 
results of operations years ended june  and net sales 
for fiscal  net sales increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was due to significant increases in sales of the company s stent systems  particularly the gfx and the micro stent ii family of products 
the gfx was released in certain countries internationally in september  and the micro stent ii was released in certain countries internationally in october the company anticipates that stent system sales will continue to constitute the vast majority of total net sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company commenced direct sales operations in the united kingdom and germany  and in the second quarter of fiscal the company began selling directly in france  switzerland  belgium and the netherlands 
all other commercial sales made by the company were through unaffiliated distributors 
the company believes that the increasing number of devices in the international stent market and the desire of companies to obtain market share has resulted in increased price competition  particularly in the second and third quarters of fiscal  which has caused the company to reduce prices on its stent systems 
price reductions in response to competitive pressure reduced net sales in the second quarter of fiscal  but were offset by increased unit sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company expects such price competition to continue  particularly in germany 
if the company is forced to effect further price reductions  such reductions would reduce net sales in future periods if not offset by increased unit sales or other factors 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars during fiscal was primarily a result of the increased volume of products sold and  to a lesser extent  the costs of additional manufacturing capacity and personnel necessary to support increased sales volume
