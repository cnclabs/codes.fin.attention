item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity worldwide 
drilling activity  in turn  is largely dependent on the price of oil and natural gas 
this is especially true in the united states  where the company generated approximately one half of its revenues during fiscal due to aging oilfields and lower cost sources of oil internationally  drilling activity in the united states has declined more than from its peak in record low drilling activity levels were experienced in and until recently  excess capacity among pumping service companies resulted in the inability to generate adequate returns on new capital investments 
to improve returns in this environment  the company believes it is important to operate with a greater critical mass in the key us markets 
this conclusion led to the decision in april to consolidate its operations with those of the western company of north america western  which had a larger presence in the united states 
the company s us operations were further increased through the acquisition of nowsco well service ltd 
nowsco in june  which added operations in the mid continental and northeastern us  the latter being an area in which the company did not have an existing presence 
relatively stronger oil and gas prices and improved oilfield technology and equipment have recently led to more favorable drilling conditions in the united states 
as a result  during august the us active rig count exceeded rigs for the first time since the us active rig count averaged rigs during the fiscal year ended september   an increase of and over the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
increases in activity occurred in drilling for both oil and natural gas 
while us drilling activity is expected to continue to be relatively strong during fiscal at current oil and gas prices  the rate of increase is expected to decline beginning in the company s second fiscal quarter 
with the exception of canada  international drilling activity has historically been less volatile than domestic drilling activity 
active international drilling rigs averaged  during  an increase of and over and  respectively  primarily on the strength of development work in canada 
calendar is expected to be a record year in terms of the number of wells drilled in canada 
canadian drilling activity is expected to remain strong during the next several years due to the completion of additional pipeline capacity 
in both the united states and internationally  there has been a continuing trend by oil and gas companies toward alliances with the service companies 
these alliances take various forms including packaged or integrated services  single source suppliers and turnkey agreements 
more than of the company s revenues were generated under such alliances during while the company s service line offerings are not as comprehensive as some of its major competitors  management believes the trend towards alliances has not had a material negative impact on the company s operating results to date 
expansions and acquisitions the company s expansion and acquisition efforts over the past several years have been focused on adding critical mass to its us operations and international geographic expansions of its existing service lines 
the company has completed two major acquisitions during this period the acquisition of western in april the western acquisition and the acquisition of nowsco in june the nowsco acquisition 
the western acquisition was completed for a total purchase price of million including transaction costs of million  for which the company paid approximately half in cash and half in shares of the company s common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the western acquisition has provided the company with a greater critical mass with which to compete in domestic and international markets and the realization of significant consolidation benefits 
the western acquisition increased the company s then existing total revenue base by approximately and more than doubled the company s then existing domestic revenue base beginning in the june quarter 
in addition  in excess of million per year of overhead and redundant operating costs have been eliminated by combining the two companies 
the nowsco acquisition was completed for a total purchase price of million including transaction costs of million in cash 
the nowsco acquisition accomplished three primary objectives i it provided the company with the number one pumping services market position in canada where the company had not operated since and added to the company s existing market position in several key us and international markets  ii it provided a technological leadership position in the high growth coiled tubing service line  and iii it provided in excess of million per year of additional cost savings through consolidation of redundant overhead and operating bases 
the nowsco acquisition added approximately to the company s then existing revenue base 
the company s other expansion efforts during the past three years have included i expanding pumping services into several key markets including brazil through acquisition of the majority ownership position from its joint venture partner  saudi arabia  qatar and vietnam  ii expanding tubular services and process and pipeline services into geographic regions outside the north sea  and iii adding additional pressure pumping service capacity in key latin american markets 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected key operating statistics reflecting industry rig count and the company s financial results year ended september  rig count us international   revenue per rig in thousands revenue per employee in thousands percentage of gross profit to revenue percentage of research and engineering expense to revenue percentage of marketing expense to revenue percentage of general and administrative expense to revenue industry estimate of average active rigs 
gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales and services 
revenue the company s revenue increased for the fifth consecutive year during  increasing by in each of the past two fiscal years 
the increase was primarily a result of the nowsco acquisition and the recovery in us drilling activity 
the increase was primarily driven by the western and nowsco acquisitions  international expansions and increased activity in latin america  the uk north sea and southeast asia 
united states the company s us revenue increased by and in and  respectively 
the increase was due to a combination of the nowsco acquisition  improved drilling activity and better pricing 
the nowsco acquisition added approximately to to the company s us revenues beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  therefore providing nine months of additional benefit during taking into account the prior year s pre acquisition nowsco revenues  the company s us operations showed a pro forma revenue increase of 
activity  as measured by the rig count  increased by during this period 
pricing improved by approximately to mainly through price book increases implemented in july and june pricing showed stronger improvement to during the last quarter of the year due to tightening capacity in the us pressure pumping market 
while management believes the company has retained most of the key customers of nowsco  it estimates the company may have experienced to of market share deterioration on a pro forma basis during due to the loss of certain low priced nowsco business to a new competitor and job turndowns due to personnel and equipment limitations 
the revenue increase reflects the benefits of the western and nowsco acquisitions 
exclusive of the benefits of these acquisitions  revenue also increased due to stronger natural gas drilling activity  most significantly in the company s south texas and gulf of mexico operations 
natural gas activity typically generates higher revenue per well for the company than oil activity 
international international revenues increased by and during and  respectively 
the increase was primarily driven by the nowsco acquisition  as approximately two thirds of nowsco s business was generated outside the united states mostly in canada and the north sea 
as a result of the nowsco acquisition  the company now has the largest pressure pumping operation in canada 
pro forma for the nowsco operations  international pressure pumping revenues increased by due primarily to strong canadian drilling activity  which increased by over other international pressure pumping operations showing the most significant revenue increases during the year were venezuela  due to increased activity and coiled tubing capacity additions  the middle east  reflecting new contracts in india and egypt and expansions into saudi arabia and bangladesh  and brazil and indonesia 
partially offsetting these increases were pro forma revenue declines in the north sea and russia 
each of the company s other international service lines  which primarily consist of tubular services and process and pipeline services  also showed pro forma revenue increases due to stronger activity and expansions into new markets 
the revenue increase was primarily attributable to three factors i the continued geographic expansion of the company s service lines  ii a significant increase in latin america  the uk north sea and southeast asia business  and iii acquisitions 
pressure pumping international expansions included qatar and vietnam in and saudi arabia and azerbaijan in the tubular services and commissioning and leak detection service lines have now operated in each of the company s international regions 
most of the revenue growth in latin america up in was a result of increased cementing and stimulation activity with both private and national oil and gas companies in argentina  the addition of a coiled tubing barge in both and to service the lake maracaibo  venezuela market and the acquisition of the remaining of the company s joint venture in brazil in november the western acquisition added international operations in nigeria  indonesia and hungary  while the nowsco acquisition added revenues beginning in the fourth quarter of operating income operating income more than doubled in both and due to the revenue increases described above  partially offset by increased goodwill amortization and unusual charges resulting from the western and nowsco acquisitions 
although increasing on an absolute basis  each of the other operating expenses ie cost of sales and services  research and engineering  marketing and general and administrative have declined as a percentage of revenues in each of the past two years primarily as a result of the economies of scale obtained from consolidating the western and nowsco operations 
the cost of sales and services as a percentage of revenue was in  down from and in and  respectively 
the improvement resulted primarily from cost reduction efforts implemented after the western and nowsco acquisitions and from the efficiencies of having larger operating bases 
net pricing also improved during  mainly in the latter part of the year  as a result of a us price book increase in june and discount reductions of approximately during the fourth fiscal quarter 
in  management believes that pricing improvement approximately offset inflation increases in its labor and material costs 
the increases in research and engineering  marketing and general and administrative operating expenses resulted primarily from additional overhead from the former nowsco and western operations 
in addition  marketing expenses increased somewhat during both and due to international expansions and higher revenues in operations which require agency commission payments  and in the us as a result of an expansion of a program which places company engineers in customer offices 
general and administrative expenses also increased in each of the past two years as a result of increased spending on information systems 
information system costs are expected to continue to increase during due to new systems recently implemented  expected upgrades to existing systems and costs currently estimated at million to million related to the review  testing and reprogramming necessary to make the company s systems compliant with year data fields 
due to the current shortage of qualified personnel especially equipment operators and engineers in the oilfield services industry  the company also expects to have a greater increase in its labor costs in compared with the past several years 
goodwill amortization increased in each of the past two years due to acquisitions 
the nowsco and western acquisitions resulted in additional annual goodwill amortization in of million and million  respectively 
the unusual charges taken in and were taken in conjunction with consolidation programs associated with the acquisitions of nowsco and western  respectively 
included in the unusual charges were adjustments to the carrying value of duplicate operating facilities  severance and related benefit costs  benefits due under agreements covering the company s executives that were triggered as a result of the western acquisition  and legal and other costs that would not have been incurred had the acquisitions not occurred 
the unusual charge associated with the nowsco acquisition was significantly lower than that of the western acquisition as the company had fewer overlapping operations with nowsco 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other interest expense increased in each of the past two years as a result of additional borrowings to fund the western and nowsco acquisitions 
the company s weighted average borrowing costs declined during primarily as a result of two major factors i utilization of lower interest rate facilities and ii improvement in the company s credit ratings 
see also financial condition capital resources and liquidity and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income was a net gain in each of the past three years due primarily to gains on asset sales  rental income and royalty income 
royalty income has declined in each of the past two years due to a reduction in use by the licensee 
income taxes primarily as a result of profitability in international jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is below the us rate  the availability of certain nonrecurring tax benefits and the availability of tax benefits from the company s reorganization pursuant to its initial public offering in  the company s effective tax rate has remained below the us statutory rate during each of the past three years 
the effective tax rate increased in primarily as a result of higher us profitability 
while increasing the company s effective tax rate  the greater us profitability has not resulted in higher cash taxes due to the existence of us net operating loss carryforwards 
the company also recognized nonrecurring tax benefits of million in and million in from the favorable settlement of tax audits and tax losses attributable to foreign exchange fluctuations in certain international jurisdictions 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity net cash provided from operating activities increased in each of the last two years primarily due to larger and more profitable operations as a result of the western and nowsco acquisitions and  in  due to a recovery in us drilling activity 
partially offsetting such increased profitability in both years were higher receivable balances and the payment of environmental  pension and merger related expenses 
net cash provided from investing activities was million in after net use of million in and million in due primarily to the nowsco and western acquisitions  respectively 
the company s property additions totaled million  increasing from million in and million in the current year s spending included two additional pumping service vessels both operating in latin america  expansion of cementing and stimulation capacity in the gulf of mexico and latin america  and improvements to the company s information systems 
major items included in spending were related to international expansion opportunities primarily in latin america and offshore cementing skids 
net cash used for investing activities was impacted by a transaction involving the transfer of certain pumping service equipment assets 
subsequent to the transfer of equipment  the company received million which was used to repay outstanding bank debt 
as a result of the reduced debt  the company will realize a reduction in future interest expense of approximately million per year 
the equipment will be used to provide services to the company for its customers for which the company will pay a service fee over a period of at least eight  but not more than fourteen  years 
the transaction generated a deferred gain for book purposes of approximately million  which will be amortized over twelve years 
the taxable gain of approximately million will be completely offset with net operating loss carryforwards that are available to the company as a result of the western acquisition 
the expected tax benefit of the net operating loss utilization has been recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
net cash used for investing activities was also impacted by the receipt of million from the sale of an idle stimulation vessel the renaissance  which was partially offset by the higher property additions and the acquisitions of top tool company  inc and the remaining ownership of the company s previously unconsolidated joint venture in argentina acquired with nowsco 
other investing activities in included the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s joint venture in brazil for total consideration of million consisting of million cash and million of debt assumed by the company and the nowsco acquisition for million in cash 
other investing activities in included the western acquisition for million in cash and million of proceeds from the sale of a duplicate facility and other disposals of assets 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to substantially exceed levels  and are expected to include spending for coiled tubing growth opportunities  additional capacity in certain high margin locations and higher levels of replacement capital 
the actual amount of capital expenditures excluding acquisitions will be primarily dependent upon the availability of expansion opportunities and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities and available credit facilities 
management believes cash flows from operating activities and available lines of credit  if necessary  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures 
because net cash flows from operating activities exceeded the company s capital requirements  the company was able to reduce existing borrowings by million during in  the nowsco acquisition was financed with the proceeds from the sale of million shares of the company s common stock that generated net proceeds of million  with the remainder provided from borrowings under its credit facility 
the financing activities were used primarily to fund the western acquisition 
management strives to maintain low cash balances while utilizing available credit facilities to meet the company s capital needs 
any excess cash generated is used to pay down outstanding borrowings 
in june  the company replaced its existing credit facility with a committed  unsecured credit facility bank credit facility executed to accommodate the acquisition of nowsco 
nowsco well service ltd  the company s canadian subsidiary  is a borrower in canadian dollars 
the bank credit facility consists of a canadian million approximately us million six year term loan  that is repayable in quarterly installments which began in march  and a five year us million revolving facility 
in october  the company reduced the commitment under the revolving facility by million to million 
at september   borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility totaled million  consisting wholly of borrowings under the term loan 
in  the company issued million of unsecured notes due that have been registered under the securities act of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes million were used by the company to repay indebtedness outstanding under the term loan portion of the company s then existing bank credit facility 
the outstanding balance of the notes was million at september   which the company repaid in december the company s interest bearing debt represented of its total capitalization at september   compared to at september  the bank credit facility includes various customary covenants and other provisions including the maintenance of certain profitability and solvency ratios and restrictions on dividend payments 
management believes that the bank credit facility  combined with other discretionary credit facilities and cash flow from operations  provides the company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage its routine operations and fund projected capital expenditures 
at september   the company had approximately million of united states tax net operating loss carryforwards expiring between and under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  the company is required to record a deferred tax asset for the future tax benefit of these tax net operating loss carryforwards  as well as other items  if realization is more likely than not 
the western acquisition provided the company with a greater critical mass with which to compete in the united states as it more than doubled the company s united states revenue base 
in addition  with the combination of nowsco and western  the company has realized significant consolidation benefits 
management estimates that in excess of million per year of overhead and redundant operating costs have been eliminated as a result of the combination of the three companies 
management has concluded that the company s future taxable income will be sufficient over the remaining caryforward periods to realize the tax benefits represented by approximately million of tax net operating loss carryforwards acquired with the acquisitions of nowsco and western and generated by the company s operations prior to such acquisitions 
net tax benefits resulting from the acquisitions approximate million and have been included as a deferred tax asset recognized in the purchase price allocation 
valuation allowances have been established for the benefits of the tax net operating loss carryforwards that are estimated to expire prior to their utilization
