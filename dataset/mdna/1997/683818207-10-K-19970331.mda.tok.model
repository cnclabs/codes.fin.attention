item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition due to the nature of the company s business  the key components of its financial condition constitute receivables  inventory  fixed assets  accounts payable  and debt 
the company saw an increase in net worth to  in prior years s trends of key financial indicators show a change in corporate net worth of  for compared to  in the current ratio increased to from in and in year end billed accounts receivable was  billed accounts receivable at year end was  and  in the average outstanding days in receivables was days 
the days outstanding in accounts receivable averaged days in  and days in the reduction in days receivable was achieved by instituting an aggressive accounts collection program 
bad debt write offs represent less than of one percent of the total yearly revenues 
the low level of bad debts is due partly to the percentage of business the company does with the us government and fortune companies 
the company also uses a careful screening process and performs credit qualification of customers before accepting their orders 
for any new account  credit checks are always conducted  and questionable situations are either placed on a cod or a letter of credit basis 
accounts receivable are closely monitored  those that are delinquent are continuously contacted until payment is received 
the overall composition of the inventory has changed somewhat over the last three years as shown in the following chart inventory composition production materials    work in process    finished goods    total    one of the tools the company uses for trend analysis is a comparison of our inventory levels to total sales 
in  this level was compared to in and in the value of the raw material and work in process inventory increased by approximately  in compared to the increase in work in process reflects orders to be shipped in early although our objective is to reduce inventory levels as much as possible  the value of finished goods inventory increased substantially in to provide products available from stock 
this action was taken to meet competitive pressures as customers are demanding shorter product delivery times 
we will attempt to reduce the amount of raw material inventory to partially offset the higher level of finished goods inventory 
the company believes that its reserve for inventory obsolescence is adequate to properly value any excess quantities of this inventory 
in  fixed asset additions were  compared to  in and  in results of operations combined revenues were higher than and higher than a profit of  which represented of revenue for  compares to a loss of for  and profit of for government products division gpd electro optics technology group e o technology groupis revenues increased compared to the increase occurred due to additional work from darpa and honeywell systems 
the trend of increase in revenues and decrease in losses has been significant over the past several years 
it appears that the unique work performed by this group may have enough market potential to achieve break even or profitability 
revenue for the last three years was  in   in  and  in comparable period losses were   and 
cost of sales the cost of sales as a percent of revenue has decreased significantly due an increase in revenue as mentioned above and a decrease in overhead costs as discussed below 
given below are the last three years results cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue overhead and g a overhead overhead costs for the e o technology group were  in   in and  in overhead expenses have decreased due to lower labor costs within the group and a lower corporate expense allocation 
the allocated costs are apportioned as a percent of floor space assigned to revenue generating activities and have been reduced as the group s facility space requirements have declined 
g a g a expenses for the division were  in   in and  in these numbers reflect a lower expense in  due to a reassignment of the activities of the chairman from divisional work to the corporate area 
laser illuminator technology group was another very successful year for this group 
the air force will require ongoing support for the glint laser illuminator system for at least the next several years 
while it is difficult to quantify the level of potential business  it is likely that optelecom will provide products and maintenance support during that period 
revenue for was  compared to  in and  in net profits were  for   for  and  for the increase in revenue in compared to was due to a change in the composition of the type of business addressed by this division 
in  contract work consisted of refurbishment of complete illuminator systems  in  work consisted essentially of fabrication of spare laser arrays  with a small additional effort associated with contract development work 
cost of sales although overhead costs for the three year period were relatively constant  the large increase in revenue in caused the cost of sales as a percent of revenue to decrease compared to and cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue overhead overhead costs for the glint division were  for compared to  for and  for overhead expenses have remained relatively stable for the last several years due to a stable work force and facility size 
g a the general and administrative expenses were  in   in and  for the increase over reflects higher corporate allocation which is apportioned on the basis of percent revenue compared to corporate revenue 
communication products division cpd communication products division revenues increased by over and resulted in a net profit of  cpd revenues in decreased by from revenues and resulted in an operating loss of  compared to a profit of  in the product sales mix was more favorable in  with oem sales up significantly and low margin products down compared to new products in fiber optic trader desks and lower cost designs helped reverse problems 
the company was successful in implementing product designs specifically intended to be produced by automatic assembly processes to minimize direct costs 
cost of sales cost of sales is the sum of direct costs to produce the product and overhead costs 
cost comparison cost of sales    gross sales    cost as a percent of revenue direct costs in  direct costs decreased in relation to revenue 
as previously mentioned  one reason for the decrease was the change in the mix of products sales compared to for instance  oem sales were up significantly in over these sales had high margins since engineering costs incurred in were recovered in the sales price and there is no direct competition which would require price reductions 
the second area of improvement was in direct manufacturing cost for standard products due to automation 
finally  the company did not have to discount prices as much as in  since our customers began to realize the value of the quality of our products 
in  direct cpd costs in relation to sales had increased by over the increase was attributed to growing competition forcing us to lower our prices 
however  the cost to produce products continued to decrease due to the investment in automated manufacturing facilities 
as more of our product designs evolve toward automated assembly  our ability to successfully compete at lower sale prices will continue to improve 
direct costs versus sales direct costs    percent of sales overhead overhead costs include facilities costs  indirect labor costs in manufacturing  applied overhead  and inventory writeoffs 
in  overhead cost as a percent of sales fell by due to an increase in sales and lower overhead costs compared to overhead costs fell in by approximately   compared to included below is a comparison of overhead costs for the past three years cost comparison overhead costs    overhead costs as a percent of revenue applied overhead applied overhead allocates costs in overhead to a final product 
the company uses a computation method in which overhead costs are divided by direct labor costs 
this establishes the percent of overhead costs to be applied to the final product 
examples of these costs include rent  utilities  telephone  inventory variances  and depreciation of production capital equipment costs 
applied overhead amounts for the past three years were  in   in  and  in inventory write offs direct inventory write offs increased slightly in to  compared to  in and  in generally  these write offs are due to engineering changes which result in obsolete raw materials and subassemblies used on products we no longer intend to sell and also to overstocking of particular items 
although we make every attempt to minimize obsolete inventory  the rapid engineering evolution of our product line and the changes in our product mix makes some obsolescence unavoidable 
g a general and administrative costs consist primarily of expenses related to sales  marketing and engineering activities and other administrative operational costs 
commercial product engineering development costs have remained constant  reflecting stable staff size and workload 
during  development focussed on additions to the product line for highway traffic monitoring equipment 
also  a new effort to develop video technology was initiated  which will result in new product introductions in the three year record of these engineering costs exclusive of fringe is  in   in  and  in the company implemented changes to the sales and marketing staff to more closely align the technical aspects of the selling process with customer requirements and also changed the corporate management staff to strengthen the divisions efforts 
the cost of this effort  as well as profit sharing expenses and reserves for bad debt are reflected in the increased g a expenses for this year  which were  prior year costs were  in and  in other operating expenses corporate income tax expense benefit was  in   in and  in this reflects the companyis return to profitability 
the effective tax rate was in the effective tax rate was in primarily as a result of realizing the tax benefit of carrying back the then current year loss to the prior year 
in the prior year  the company recorded a  income tax refund receivable in for amounts expected to be received in interest expense of  increased in compared to  in and  in the operating loss in forced the company to borrow funds from it s line of credit in advertising costs decreased substantially in these costs include advertising in trade magazines  participation in trade shows  and product literature  including catalogs and specification sheets 
compared to prior years  the type of advertising changed as a result of a redirection of our advertising emphasis 
advertising expenditure decreases occurred mainly in the areas of magazines and trade shows 
the costs of advertising for the last three years were  in   in and  in impact of inflation inflation has not had any significant effect on the operations of the company during  and we do not expect it to have any significant effect during liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements are largely generated by working capital needs 
these needs are primarily focussed on financing inventories and accounts receivable 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was  in  as a result of a net operating loss and increases in inventory balances  net cash used in operational activities was 
non cash costs such as depreciation and amortization were  in cash used in investing activities in was  and included expenditures for capital equipment for manufacturing operations  facility upgrades  and general office equipment 
to finance these activities  optelecom used existing cash flows  borrowing in short term notes and long term borrowings for equipment 
no other material changes in cash flow are expected 
the company has the ability  provided there are sufficient eligible receivables  to borrow up to  under its line of credit as of december  the company also has the ability to borrow funds for specific capital asset purchases to a maximum of  from a local bank 
loans for these assets are collateralized by the specific equipment asset and payable over no more than years 
at the end of  the outstanding balance on this loan was
