in  net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  increased million  or  compared to the million total in this increase in net interest income was the result of a million  or  increase in interest income  offset by a million  or  increase in interest expense over the comparable prior year period 
the million increase in interest income for  as compared to  was due to a million favorable volume variance  slightly offset by a million unfavorable rate variance 
the favorable volume variance was attributable to growth in average interest earning assets  which increased million  or  from the prior year comparable period 
the increase in average interest earning assets consisted of increases in each component of the company s interest earning assets  and resulted from significant growth in the company s average deposits  which were up million  or  from the comparable prior year period 
average loans increased million  or  in this year to year increase was largely related to the new special industry niches as well as the new products developed by the company during the past three years  and to the new loan offices opened by the company during the past two years 
excluding the impact of these new offices  the company s technology and life sciences niche experienced minimal net loan growth during as an active market for public stock offerings  coupled with merger and acquisition activity involving the company s client base  resulted in the payoff or reduction of a number of credit facilities by the company s clients 
the increase in average investment securities during of million  or  was primarily centered in notes issued by us agencies as well as in commercial paper 
this significant increase resulted from the aforementioned strong deposit growth in and was the result of management s decision to increase as well as further diversify the company s portfolio of short term investment securities in connection with its liquidity and investment management activities 
this increase in average investment securities also reflected management s decision to lengthen the average life of the company s investment portfolio in an effort to obtain the higher yields available due to the steepening of the yield curve during average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell increased million  or  in  and this increase was also a result of the aforementioned strong growth in deposits 
for additional discussion of the company s liquidity and investment management activities  see the item sections entitled asset liability management and liquidity 
interest income in decreased million from due to an unfavorable rate variance 
short term market interest rates declined during the latter part of and early  and remained relatively unchanged for the remainder of as a result of this decline  the company earned lower yields in on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and its investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature  resulting in a million unfavorable rate variance as compared to the prior year 
the average yield earned on loans in decreased basis points from  accounting for the remaining million of the total unfavorable rate variance 
the decrease in the average loan yield was attributable to both increased competition and a decline in the average prime rate charged by the company  as a substantial portion of the company s loans are prime rate based 
the overall decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets of one percent from to was due to a combination of the effect of increased competition on loan yields  the decline in short term market interest rates as well as the company s prime rate  and a shift in the composition of average interest earning assets towards a higher percentage of short term  lower yielding investment securities  as the company s strong growth in average deposits during outpaced growth in average loans 
the million increase in interest income for  as compared to  was the result of a million favorable volume variance and a million favorable rate variance 
the million favorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
this increase consisted of loans  which increased million  and lower yielding liquid investments in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell  which increased a combined million  and was offset by a million decrease in investment securities due to maturities and paydowns 
though average loans in increased from principally due to net commercial loan growth of million  average loans were negatively impacted during by an active market for public stock offerings  as the company experienced a large amount of loan payoffs in connection with a number of its clients completing public stock offerings 
the increase in average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell resulted from significant growth in the company s deposits  and from management s decision to invest excess funds in short term  liquid investments due to the relatively flat interest rate environment throughout the yield curve during much of the increase in market interest rates throughout and the early part of also contributed to the growth in interest income in interest income in increased million  as compared to  due to a basis points increase in the average yield on interest earning assets 
of this increase  million was attributable to loans  as the average yield on loans increased to in  up from in the increase in total interest expense for of million  as compared to  was primarily attributable to a million unfavorable volume variance which resulted from a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
this increase was almost entirely related to the company s highest rate paying deposit product  a bonus money market account  which increased million from the prior year due to the high level of client liquidity attributable to the strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community and into the public equity markets 
changes in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities had a million favorable impact on interest expense in as compared to this slight decrease in interest expense resulted from a reduction in the average rate paid on the company s bonus money market account deposit product from in to in  offset by a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities towards the company s aforementioned bonus money market account 
the reduction in the average rate paid on the company s bonus money market account deposit product was due to both the decline in short term market interest rates during the latter part of and early  and to a reduction in the pricing of this deposit product in early total interest expense in increased million from the total in due to increases in both the volume of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities during was concentrated in the company s bonus money market account  and resulted in a million increase in the cost of funding during changes in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities also had an unfavorable impact on interest expense in as compared to the prior year 
the rising interest rate environment during and early led to a million increase in interest expense  as the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total loans  and on management s periodic assessment of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments 
the company s provision for loan losses totaled million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in the provision for loan losses from to reflected an increase in net charge offs of million during  compared to the million  or  increase in the provision for loan losses  compared to  was related to an increase in nonperforming loans during for a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses  see the item section entitled financial condition credit quality and the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income the following table summarizes the components of noninterest income for the past three years years ended december  dollars in thousands disposition of clients warrants    letter of credit and foreign exchange income    deposit service charges    investment gains losses  other  total noninterest income    noninterest income decreased million  or  in as compared to this decrease was due to a million decline in income from the disposition of client warrants  offset by a combined increase of million in the company s components of fee income  and by a million decrease in losses incurred through sales of investment securities 
noninterest income increased million  or  in as compared to this growth was largely attributable to a million increase in income from the disposition of client warrants  and a million decrease in losses incurred through sales of investment securities 
the company has historically obtained rights to acquire stock in the form of warrants in certain clients as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control techniques employed by the company to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming 
interest rates  loan fees and collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond the control of the company  including the general condition of the public equity markets  and therefore cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy and is likely to vary materially from period to period 
during the years ended december   and  a significant portion of the income realized by the company from the disposition of client warrants was offset by expenses related to the company s efforts to build an infrastructure sufficient to support present and prospective business activities  as well as evaluate and pursue new business opportunities  and was also offset by the need to increase the provision for loan losses during those years 
the company realized approximately million in warrant related income during january related to one of the clients of the bank

letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees and other trade finance income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the million earned in  and an increase of million  or  from the total earned in the growth in this category of noninterest income reflects a concerted effort by management to expand the penetration of trade finance related products and services among the company s client base  a large percentage of which provide products and services in international markets 
income related to deposit service charges totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
clients compensate the company for depository services either through earnings credits computed on their demand deposit balances  or via explicit payments recognized by the company as deposit service charges income 
the increase in deposit service charges income in was attributable to growth in the company s client base  combined with declining short term market interest rates in late and early that subsequently remained relatively unchanged for the remainder of this interest rate environment resulted in lower earnings credits for clients during  and thus increased the amount of explicit deposit service charges income realized by the company 
conversely  as short term market interest rates rose during and early  the earnings credits were higher in as compared to  thereby lowering the amount of explicit deposit service charges income earned in versus the company realized a nominal gain on sales of investment securities during  compared to losses incurred through sales of investment securities totaling million and million in and  respectively 
the securities sold during were primarily mortgage backed securities  while the securities sold during included mortgage backed securities  as well as us treasury and us agencies securities 
all investment securities sold were classified as available for sale  and all sales were conducted as a normal component of the company s asset liability and liquidity management activities

the following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on investment securities held by the company as of december  the weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of available for sale securities  which are reported at fair value 
expected remaining maturities of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations will generally differ from their contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties

when interest rates decline  prepayments generally tend to increase  causing the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs and the cmo to decline 
conversely  if interest rates rise  prepayments tend to decrease  lengthening the average expected remaining maturity of the mbs and the cmo 
loans the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  for each of the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands commercial      real estate term      real estate construction      consumer and other      total loans      total loans at december   net of unearned income  were million  a million  or  increase compared to the million outstanding at december  the increase in loans from the year end total was largely related to both the new niches and products developed by the company during the past three years  and the new loan offices opened by the company during the past two years 
excluding the impact of these new offices  the company s technology and life sciences niche experienced minimal net loan growth during as an active market for public stock offerings  coupled with merger and acquisition activity involving the company s client base  resulted in the payoff or reduction of a number of credit facilities by the company s clients

one consequence of an active market for public stock offerings is the payoff or reduction of a portion of the bank s loans by some of its clients which complete public stock offerings 
such a reduction in outstanding loans  if significant  could adversely affect the company s consolidated earnings 
loan administration responsibility for the company s loan policies resides with the company s board of directors 
this responsibility is managed through the approval and periodic review of the company s loan policies 
the board of directors delegates authority to the directors loan committee to supervise the loan underwriting  approval and monitoring activities of the company 
the directors loan committee consists of outside board of directors members and the company s chief executive officer  who serves as an alternate 
under the oversight of the directors loan committee  lending authority is delegated to the chief credit officer and the company s internal loan committee consisting of the chief credit officer  niche and practice managers  and loan administrators

the company also hired experienced loan administrators and loan review officers in an effort to restore and maintain a high level of asset quality in its loan portfolio 
credit quality and the allowance for loan losses credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
while the bank follows underwriting and credit monitoring procedures which it believes are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio  in the event of nonperformance by these other parties  the bank s potential exposure to credit losses could significantly affect the company s consolidated financial position  earnings and growth 
lending money involves an inherent risk of nonpayment 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the portfolio  management seeks to reduce such risks 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate to provide a financial buffer for losses  both identified and unidentified  in the loan portfolio 
management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio to determine the risk profile of each credit  and to identify credits whose risk profiles have changed 
this review includes  but is not limited to  such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
potential problem credits are identified and  based upon known information  action plans are developed 
management has established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this process attempts to assess the risk of losses inherent in the portfolio by segregating the allowance for loan losses into three components specific  loss migration  and general 
the specific component is established by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to individual classified credits on the basis of specific circumstances and assessments 
the loss migration component is calculated as a function of the historical loss migration experience of the internal loan credit risk rating categories 
the general component is an unallocated portion that supplements the first two components and includes management s judgment of the effect of current and forecasted economic conditions on the borrowers abilities to repay  an evaluation of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the size of the overall loan portfolio  an evaluation of the composition of  and growth trends within  the loan portfolio  consideration of the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  net charge off trends  and other factors 
while this evaluation process utilizes historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of management 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows december  dollars in thousands beginning balance      charge offs commercial      real estate   consumer and other total charge offs      recoveries commercial     real estate   consumer and other total recoveries     net charge offs recoveries     provision for loan losses      ending balance      net charge offs recoveries to average total loans the following table displays the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans percent percent of total of total december  amount percent amount loans amount loans of total loans dollars in thousands commercial    real estate term real estate construction consumer and other unallocated  n a  n a  n a total    percent percent of total of total december  amount loans amount loans commercial   real estate term  real estate construction  consumer and other  unallocated  n a  n a total   the allowance for loan losses was million at december   an increase of million  or  compared to the million balance at december  this increase was due to the net effect of the company contributing million during in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses  offset by net charge offs of million during gross charge offs for were million  and primarily resulted from five credits  none of which were related to the bank s technology and life sciences niche 
gross recoveries of million in included million related to one commercial credit that was partially charged off in net loan recoveries in of million included million in recoveries from a real estate client relationship that had been charged off in and million related to the aforementioned commercial credit that was partially charged off in net loan charge offs of million in included the partial charge off of loans to two commercial borrowers totaling million 
net loan charge offs in and and the million provision for loan losses during were directly influenced by certain events in the third and fourth quarters of the bank incurred several large charge offs stemming from declines in the appraised values of real estate collateral 
construction time and delays imposed by bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings hampered efforts to gain control and effectively dispose of collateral in a timely manner 
these delays contributed to a reduction in market values as the deteriorating condition of san francisco bay area real estate markets caused sales prices to decline rapidly during in addition  several of the bank s commercial clients filed for protection under bankruptcy laws  contributing to an impairment of the company s collateral and resulting in loan charge offs 
in general  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  however  future changes in circumstances  economic conditions or other factors could cause management to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as deemed necessary 
nonperforming assets consist of loans that are past due days or more but are still accruing interest  loans on nonaccrual status and oreo 
the following table sets forth certain relationships between nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses

the reclassified amounts are   and  at december   and  respectively 
the detailed composition of nonaccrual loans is presented in the following table 
there were no real estate construction loans on nonaccrual at december  and december  dollars in thousands commercial   real estate term   consumer and other total nonaccrual loans   nonperforming loans totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the million balance at december  nonperforming loans at december  included one credit in excess of million that was more than days past due as of december  the export import bank of the us ex im provided the bank with a guarantee of this credit facility  and the bank s claim on this guarantee was approved for payment by the ex im in early excluding this one past due loan  the allowance for loan losses would have been of nonperforming loans as of december  the million increase in nonperforming loans at december   compared to year end  was concentrated in two commercial credits  one of which was paid off during the other credit remained in nonperforming loans as of december  and management believes  based on currently known information  that this credit is adequately secured with collateral and specific reserves 
the significant improvement in nonperforming loans during and  compared to the level at the end of  reflects the concerted efforts of management to improve the company s credit discipline and processes and to strengthen its credit administration group staffing 
in addition to the loans disclosed in the foregoing analysis  management has identified three loans with principal amounts aggregating approximately million  that  on the basis of information known by management as of december   were judged to have a higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming 
the company is not aware of any other loans at december  where known information about possible problems of the borrower casts serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
oreo totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the million balance at december  this decrease resulted from sales of oreo properties during the company did not transfer any loans to oreo in  and the remaining oreo balance at december  was composed of two properties  each consisting of multiple undeveloped lots  and each acquired prior to june deposits the company s deposits are primarily obtained from emerging growth and middle market businesses within the technology and life sciences niche  including both venture capital backed and publicly financed companies  and  to a lesser extent  from professional service firms and business executives 
the company does not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and does not accept brokered deposits

a significant portion of the increase in deposits during was concentrated in the company s highest rate paying deposit product  a bonus money market account  which increased million  or  from december   due to the high level of client liquidity attributable to the strong inflow of investment capital into the venture capital community and into the public equity market 
noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million  or  from the prior year end  primarily due to an increase in the company s client base resulting from its business development efforts 
time certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more totaled million at december  no material portion of the company s deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect the business of the company 
asset liability management a key objective of asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk due to changing asset and liability cash flows and market interest rate movements 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities do not reprice simultaneously and in equal volumes 
the asset liability committee of the bank alco provides oversight to the asset liability management process and recommends policy guidelines for approval by the board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis  and decisions regarding the management of earnings exposure due to changes in balance sheet structure and or market interest rates are made when appropriate and agreed to by the alco 
one measure of the mismatch between asset and liability repricing is the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to reprice within a specific time period and the amount of funding sources anticipated to reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of funding sources repricing within that same time period 
positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates rise 
negative cumulative gaps suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall 
company policy guidelines provide that the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets should not exceed 
the gap analysis as of december  indicates that the company was positioned within these guidelines as the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets was 
the table on the next page illustrates the company s interest rate sensitivity gap position at december  while traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet  it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in forecasted earnings resulting from changes in market interest rates over time 
accordingly  the alco combines the use of gap analysis with the use of a simulation model which provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity 
the company s asset liability management simulation model provides the alco with the ability to simulate net interest income using either one interest rate forecast simple simulation or a forecast of multiple interest rate scenarios stochastic simulation 
the simulation model captures the dynamics of the company s balance sheet  such as repricing and prepayment behavior  as well as its off balance sheet financial instruments 
the simulation model also anticipates balance sheet mix changes and trends  based upon certain assumptions made by management  and affords the ability to simulate pro forma balance sheets  income statements  cash flows  and the sensitivity of these items to changing interest rates 
however  the simulation model does not take into account future actions of the alco which could be undertaken to alter these simulated results 
in order to measure  as of december   the sensitivity of the company s forecasted net interest income to changing interest rates  utilizing the simple simulation methodology  both a rising and falling interest rate scenario were projected and compared to a base interest rate forecast derived from the treasury yield curve 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base interest rate forecast was increased or decreased  as applicable  by basis points in equal increments over a one year period 
company policy guidelines provide that the difference between a base interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding one year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest income sensitivity exceeding 
simulations as of december  indicated the company was well within these policy guidelines

the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet loan demand and depositors needs  and to service other liabilities as they come due  without causing an undue amount of cost or risk  and without causing a disruption to normal operating conditions 
the company regularly assesses the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns  present and forecasted market and economic conditions  individual client funding needs  and existing and planned company business activities 
the alco provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines  subject to board of directors approval  and courses of action to address the company s actual and projected liquidity needs 
the ability to attract a stable  low cost base of deposits is the company s primary source of liquidity 
other sources of liquidity available to the company include short term borrowings  which consist of federal funds purchased  security repurchase agreements and other short term borrowing arrangements 
the company s liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of its portfolio of liquid assets 
liquid assets  as defined  include cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations  federal funds sold  securities purchased under resale agreements  investment securities maturing within six months  investment securities eligible and available for pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of six months  and anticipated near term cash flows from investments 
bank policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a percentage of total deposits should not fall below 
at december   the bank s ratio of liquid assets to total deposits was 
this ratio is well in excess of the bank s minimum policy guidelines and is slightly higher than the comparable ratio of as of december  in addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits  the bank also utilizes other policy measures in its liquidity management activities 
as of december  and  the bank was in compliance with all of these policy measures 
in analyzing the company s liquidity during  reference is made to the company s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
the statement of cash flows includes separate categories for operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities included net income of million for  which was adjusted for certain non cash items including the provision for loan losses  depreciation  deferred income taxes  and an assortment of other miscellaneous items 
investing activities consisted primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of investment securities  which resulted in a net cash outflow of million  and the net change in total loans resulting from loan originations and principal collections  which increased million in financing activities reflected the net change in the company s total deposits  which increased million during  and included million of cash proceeds received during the year from the issuance of company common stock 
in total  the transactions noted above resulted in a net cash inflow of million for the year and total cash and cash equivalents  as defined in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  of million at december capital resources management seeks to maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks  and to ensure that the company and the bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines 
the primary source of new capital for the company has been the retention of earnings 
aside from current earnings  an additional source of new capital for the company has been proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s employee benefit plans  including the company s and stock option plans  the employee stock ownership plan  and the employee stock purchase plan 
shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the million balance at december  this increase was due to earnings of million  million in net capital generated during through employee benefit plans  and an increase in the after tax net unrealized gain on available for sale investments of million from the prior year end 
the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the company paid nominal cash dividends on its common stock from to in order to qualify the common stock as an eligible investment for institutional investors requiring a cash yield 
the board of directors of the company indefinitely suspended plans to pay further cash dividends in the third quarter of in response to the net loss and level of nonperforming assets in the third quarter of the following table presents the relationship between significant financial ratios years ended december  return on average assets divided by average equity as a percentage of average assets equals return on average equity times earnings retained equals internal capital growth the company and the bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the federal reserve board 
under these capital guidelines  the minimum total risk based capital requirement is of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items for a well capitalized depository institution 
at least of the total risk based capital ratio must consist of tier capital  defined as common stock  retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock cumulative perpetual preferred stock for bank holding companies  and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less most intangible assets  and the remainder may consist of eligible term subordinated debt  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  long term preferred stock  a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses  and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity 
the federal reserve board has established minimum capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks 
the ratio is determined using tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets 
the guidelines require a minimum of for a well capitalized depository institution 
the company s risk based capital ratios were in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized depository institution as of december   and capital ratios for the company are set forth below december  total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio the decrease in the company s capital ratios from december  to december  primarily resulted from a significant increase in total assets during the improvement in the company s total and tier risk based capital ratios from december  to december  was attributable to asset growth during primarily occurring in lower risk weighted assets  and also to an increase in tier capital 
the increase in tier capital resulted from net income and capital generated through the company s employee benefit plans
