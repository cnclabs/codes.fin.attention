foreign currency 
barra  as an international corporation  generates revenues from clients throughout the world  maintains sales and representative offices world wide and holds certain deposits and accounts in foreign currencies 
barra s revenues are generated from both united states and foreign currencies 
barra s subscriptions in the united kingdom and the european community are priced in british pounds sterling pounds and european currency units ecus  respectively 
additionally  barra s consolidated subsidiary  barra international japan  ltd 
barra japan  generates revenues  has expenses and has assets and liabilities in japanese yen 
all other things being equal  weakening of the us dollar has a positive impact on profits  and strengthening of the us dollar has a negative impact 
the company has considered its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations and to this point has decided not to engage in hedging or managing exposures to foreign currency fluctuations through contracts for the purchase  sale or swapping of currencies 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  there was a significant strengthening of the us dollar against the yen while average exchange rates for pounds and ecu s remained relatively constant 
the company estimates that the impact of the declining value of the yen versus the us dollar during fiscal accounted for a reduction of approximately  in consolidated revenues and approximately  in consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended march  for fiscal compared to fiscal  there was no material impact from foreign currency fluctuations on barra s consolidated statements of income 
although the us dollar strengthened significantly against the yen and less significantly against the pound during fiscal  the average of the exchange rates during fiscal and did not change significantly and therefore the impact on revenues and net income was not significant 
because the functional currency of barra japan is the yen  the translation gains and losses associated with the consolidation of its balance sheets at points in time are reported as part of shareholders equity 
under current operating arrangements in the countries in which barra does business  there are no restrictions upon the flow of funds from barra s foreign subsidiary to the parent company 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total operating revenues represented by items in barra s consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended march operating revenues subscription and consulting fees electronic brokerage and information asset management total operating revenues operating expenses cost of subscription products compensation and benefits rent expense other operating expenses merger costs and one time charges total operating expenses interest income and other income before equity in net income and loss of investees  minority interest  and income taxes equity in net income and loss of investees minority interest income before income taxes income taxes net income operating revenues subscription and consulting fees 
subscription and consulting fees consist of subscription fees for barra s software products and revenues from other sources related to the institutional analytics business which include timesharing revenues  seminar revenues and other recurring and one time fees 
in addition  as a result of the merger with rogerscasey  these revenues also include annual retainer and project fees for consulting services provided to pension plan sponsors and investment managers 
a summary of the components of this revenue is as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal change from change from prior fiscal year prior fiscal year analytics subscriptions    other analytics related    consulting    total    analytics subscriptions are for barra s software products and related data updates 
the company generally bills and collects fees on an annual basis  but recognizes the income th per month over each year of the subscription period 
the growth in annual subscription fees continues to be generated from a combination of both obtaining new clients as well as increasing revenues from existing customers through the introduction of new products and services 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  annual subscription fee revenue for the u 
s and non us markets increased approximately and  respectively 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  annual subscription fee revenue for the u 
s and non us markets increased approximately and  respectively 
for both markets  revenue growth primarily came from equity models and related data reflecting the continued success of aegis 
various new single country and global versions of this equity analytics system have been introduced continuously since july fixed income product sales also contributed  primarily to the non us increase  as a result of sales of the global version of the barra cosmos system tm  which was introduced in may increases in subscription revenues continue to come most significantly from net increases in the number of subscriptions and less significantly from changes in the prices of subscriptions 
revenues from other sources related to the institutional analytics business include timesharing revenues  seminar revenues and other recurring and one time fees 
the decline in the relative and absolute amounts of this component of revenue continues to be from the conversion of clients from timesharing to in house computers for running barra s products and declines in analytics related one time fees as a result of a de emphasis on such revenue opportunities 
consulting fees consist primarily of services to pension plan sponsors sponsor services which are usually recurring retainer based fee arrangements  and consulting to money managers strategic services  which are usually non recurring  project type engagements that are completed in phases 
also included in strategic services revenues are fees related to consulting work done in connection with strategic transactions involving clients 
accordingly  strategic services revenues are susceptible to a large degree of variability depending on the ability to source new projects and the unpredictable nature and significance of fees associated with strategic transactions 
the increase in total consulting revenues over the past three years has been driven almost equally between growth in retainer based fee clients and one time project revenues including a strategic transaction fee in fiscal that accounted for approximately of the total consulting fees 
electronic brokerage and information 
electronic brokerage and information revenues increased  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal electronic brokerage and information revenues consists principally of license fees from posit 
barra s revenues from posit are derived from commissions generated by the trading volume in the system 
shares traded in the system were billion  billion and billion  for calendar years ended december    and respectively 
posit revenue increases reflect higher trading volumes attributed to increased numbers of users of the system as well as greater usage of the system by its major participants 
the consolidation of bond express for the first time in fiscal accounted for  of the increase in electronic brokerage and information revenues from fiscal over fiscal asset management 
asset management revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal asset management revenues consist of business from both symphony and rogerscasey asset management services  which include management of customized multi manager programs and advisory services for private equity non marketable investment programs 
symphony s revenues consist primarily of asset management fees which are a fixed percentage of asset value and performance fees which are based on the performance over a benchmark for each account 
symphony s total revenues were  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal performance fees included in total revenues were   and none for the   and fiscal years  respectively 
performance fees are recognized only at the measurement date for determining performance of an account  which typically is at the end of the first year of the contract and on each subsequent annual anniversary date thereafter 
the increase in performance fee revenues for fiscal is the result not only of investment performance in excess of benchmarks  but the fact that assets under management that are subject to performance fees have grown significantly 
as of the beginning of fiscal  symphony had approximately billion of assets under direct management 
in addition  as of april   the assets of a former unit of rogerscasey  which managed approximately million of private equity non marketable investments were purchased by symphony llc 
of the funds under direct management  approximately million are managed under agreements that provide for performance fees in addition to a base management fee 
symphony s future revenues will depend  in some cases to a great extent  on the performance of the funds it manages and the timing of anniversary fee determination dates for performance based funds 
revenues from foreign customers 
the percentage of barra s total operating revenues derived from foreign customers represented  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the percentage of barra s subscription and consulting revenues total revenues excluding electronic brokerage and asset management revenues derived from foreign customers was  and for the same periods  respectively 
in fiscal the weakening of the us dollar compared to the currencies in barra s major non us markets contributed to an increase in revenues from non us sources 
for fiscal currency fluctuations on average had no material impact on revenues from non us sources and for fiscal  the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacted reported revenues 
operating expenses cost of subscription products 
cost of subscription products consists of computer access charges  data and software acquisition expenses  barra s computer leasing expenses  and seminar expenses 
this component of operating expenses has increased  or  in fiscal over fiscal  and  or  in fiscal over fiscal increases during the last three years are primarily due to increased data  computer access and outside computer service costs associated with new and existing barra services 
the company anticipates that data costs will continue to increase into the future as barra s demands for new and expanded data sources increase in order to meet product development  enhancement and market needs 
it is anticipated that reductions in annual costs from outside computer services under a new contract for these services will partially offset increased data costs 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits increased  or in fiscal over fiscal  and  or in fiscal over fiscal these annual increases in compensation and benefits costs are in part attributable to growth in the number of full time employees  which increased approximately and in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  the increase in expense also includes approximately  of special incentive compensation earned by symphony principals for the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
starting with the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  this compensation converted to a profits interest that is included in minority interest in the statements of income 
also  in fiscal  the consolidation of bond express contributed  of the increase from a year ago 
the company s annual salary administration and performance evaluation process results in annual reviews and salary adjustments that are effective as of july of each year 
rent expense 
rent expense increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal during fiscal there were office moves to larger quarters in san francisco for symphony  hong kong  and new york  and a new office was opened in cape town 
these expansions  in combination with higher occupancy related expenses at the berkeley headquarters  resulted in the increase in rent expense for fiscal over fiscal the increase in rent expense for fiscal over fiscal is almost entirely due to the operation of symphony  which entered into a new office space lease in the latter stages of fiscal in addition to the increased costs from the changes  it is anticipated that there will be increased costs associated with the move to a new berkeley headquarters building  new offices in san francisco for consulting units and two more new offices to be opened in fiscal other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and increased  or in fiscal over fiscal other operating expenses include travel  office  maintenance  depreciation  amortization  marketing  advertising  outside legal and accounting services  data and other expenses related to the asset management operations  and other corporate expenses 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was predominantly the result of higher external development costs associated with information systems upgrades and higher data costs at symphony related to their increase in revenues 
other increases in travel  computer and office equipment  outside printing and documentation and insurance related expenses were reflective of  and consistent with  the general growth of barra s business and the costs of supporting a larger client base 
the consolidation of bond express also contributed approximately  to the increase during fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of development and initial marketing costs for aegis and rogerscasey s investworks product  both of which were launched in fiscal symphony also contributed to the increase in expenses as its operations grew 
these increases were partially offset by general improvements in barra s cost control measures and reductions in computer related costs and professional services fees associated with various non recurring consulting projects and other studies conducted in fiscal merger costs and one time charges 
in fiscal  in connection with the rogerscasey merger  the company recorded related costs of approximately  consisting of the following i  in legal  accounting and other outside professional services  ii  in severance  relocation and other costs associated with integrating the combined operations of the two firms  and iii  in incremental travel and related expenditures 
the company also recorded a one time charge of approximately  for the write off of capitalized software related to a product under development in which the costs were not recoverable based on revenue estimates and whose value was therefore impaired 
interest income and other 
interest income and other increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal these increases year over year are in large part due to increases in cash and cash equivalents generated from operations that are available for investment as well as a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of all outstanding rogerscasey indebtedness subsequent to the merger 
the increases were also the result of  and  of gains recorded in fiscal and  respectively  on investments in a limited partnership managed by symphony 
equity in net income and loss of investees 
net losses from barra s joint ventures and other strategic relationships now represent primarily barra s share of losses from its global posit joint venture and  beginning in fiscal  data downlink corporation 
the losses decreased in fiscal from fiscal and primarily as a result of non recurring losses incurred by the company in prior years in connection with interests in metaxis sa and metaxis placements sa minority interest 
minority interest represents the net of a share of bond express lps net loss and  beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal  the profits interest of the symphony principals 
see the discussion of compensation above 
the increase in fiscal is the result of profits from the symphony business

the company is required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal and will restate at that time earnings per share eps data for prior periods to conform with sfas earlier application is not permitted 
sfas replaces current eps reporting requirements and requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted eps 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock 
if sfas had been in effect during the fiscal years ended march   and  basic eps would have been  and  respectively 
diluted eps under sfas would not have been significantly different than primary eps currently reported for those periods
