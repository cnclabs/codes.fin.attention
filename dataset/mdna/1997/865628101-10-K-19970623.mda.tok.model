forward looking statements include  among others statements regarding future product revenue levels  statements regarding future international sales  statements regarding future gross profit levels statements regarding the level of future selling  general and administrative  research and development expenses  statements regarding product development  introduction and marketing  and statements regarding the sufficiency of the company s existing cash and available for sale securities to meet future operating cash requirements 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
the market for telecommunication switches is based upon sophisticated technologies and is subject to rapid technological change  new product introductions and a multiplicity of current and evolving standards 
products marketed by certain competitors of the company may have design and functionality capabilities similar to and or in certain respects  more advanced than the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that the company s operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition and technological factors 
the company believes that to remain competitive  it depends on a variety of factors  including product selection  successful and timely completion of product development and its ability to offer products at competitive prices 
some additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth below 
the company has recently announced agreements in principle with dialogic  inc and junction  inc 
which it anticipates will result in the creation of future products 
the company anticipates that the expenses associated with this developmental activity will be partially funded from its fiscal budget  the balance will be charged to operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that this relationship will result in the development of salable product s which will be beneficial to the future of the company or that products produced by this relationship will be developed in a cost effective manner and be available for sale within the time frame required 
the company is dependent upon sole source suppliers for certain key components used in its products 
the company purchases these sole source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
no assurance can be given that sole source suppliers will devote the resources necessary to support the enhancement or continued availability of such components or that any such supplier will not encounter financial or operational difficulties 
in addition  in certain instances  components required for certain sub assemblies used in the company s products are no longer being manufactured 
the company has historically been able to secure such components by utilizing its network of suppliers 
however  the company is redesigning such sub assemblies in order to eliminate production interruptions that could occur if such components cannot be acquired 
the company is actively seeking alternative solutions to address potentially serious delays or shortages from its major component supplier 
if delays or shortages occur and the company is unable to effect alternative supply arrangements  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
a variety of factors could influence the level of the company s net revenues in a particular quarter  including general economic conditions in the telecommunications switching industry  the timing of significant orders  shipment delays  the introduction of new products by the company  the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  acquisitions by the company  patterns of capital spending by customers and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
since a substantial portion of the expenses of the company do not vary relative to sales levels  if net revenues in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s gross margin has declined in recent periods and may continue to decline as a result of potential sales price reductions and increased use of indirect distribution channels 
gross margins are also affected by other factors such as changes in the cost of materials  production and quality considerations  and the timing of new product introductions 
the company from time to time adds functionality and features that add cost to its products  and the company s gross margins will be adversely affected to the extent the company is not able to increase the price of such systems to offset such increased costs 
the company s future results of operation and financial condition will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for its products  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing on proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain and or adequately protect the intellectual property required for it to compete effectively 
the company s ability to develop marketable products and maintain a competitive position in light of continuing technological developments will depend  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for the services of these key employees is intense 
the company s international business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including the challenges of building and managing foreign operations  unique product requirements  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  import export duties  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in foreign markets 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance
