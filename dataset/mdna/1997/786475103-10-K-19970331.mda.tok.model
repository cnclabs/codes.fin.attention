overview the company believes that its growth has resulted primarily from the successful introduction of new products  the expansion of its customer base and increased sales to its existing customers 
in  the company expanded its product line from child safety products to include child care  convenience and activity items 
some of the products that the company in recent years added are bulk items ie  larger products requiring packaging in boxes that have significantly higher unit prices but provide lower gross margins than the company s other products  which are generally smaller products packaged in blister packs ie transparent plastic 
in  the company introduced a new line of home security products 
by early  the company was distributing approximately products to more than  customers 
during the second quarter of the year  the company recognized that its product offerings had proliferated to an unmanageable quantity including products outside of its core competency 
this product proliferation and continual expansion of the customer base had led to i additional complexity in all operational aspects of the business  ii a significant increase in the ongoing level of general and administrative expenses  and iii an increase in working capital requirements 
as a result  during the second quarter  the company began a review of its business strategy and took the first steps to refocus its business on its traditional core product lines  trade channels and customer base 
the company recorded charges of million during the second quarter primarily related to valuation of assets affected by this strategic refocus 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of  management recognized that the initial attempts to refocus the company and to simplify its business environment had been insufficient and determined that the focus of its products needed to be substantially narrower than had been previously estimated 
the company believed that to reduce the substantial financial risks associated with large scale introductions of new products  while achieving large scale benefits from simplification of its business practices  additional evaluation of the company s products  customers and markets were necessary 
as a result  during the fourth quarter the company implemented a number of changes and recorded a pre tax charge of million associated with the redefinition of its business strategy 
among the steps taken  the company i reduced juvenile product offerings from a maximum level during the year of approximately to approximately at year end  ii reduced home security product offerings from a maximum level during the year of approximately to approximately at year end  iii reduced the number of package assortment options available to a retailer for a given product  thereby reducing the number of stock keeping units skus from to at the end of  and iv increased minimum order quantity requirements from retailers
