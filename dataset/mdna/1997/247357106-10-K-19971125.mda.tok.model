item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations increased second year sales of the company s transgenic cotton varieties containing the bollgard gene technology  the first commercial sales of d pl cotton varieties containing the roundup ready gene technology  and the commencement of the conversion of sales of paymaster stripper varieties from a certified seed program to direct sales by the company are the major causes of d pl reporting record sales despite the fact that acreage planted in cotton in the us declined to million acres from levels of million acres 
the cold wet weather during the cotton planting season contributed to the reduction in cotton acreage planted well below initial usda and company estimates 
the company sold sufficient quantities of seed containing the bollgard gene to plant million acres of which about  acres were ultimately plowed down or replanted resulting in final net billable bollgard acres of million  a increase over levels 
net billable roundup ready acres in were  international cotton seed sales and domestic soybean unit sales also increased and  respectively 
in  d pl announced a program to optimize production and cost operating efficiencies which will include the idling of three of its less efficient delinting plants  the write down of assets whose value has been impaired as a result of implementing the plan  plant consolidation costs relating to implementation of a new process manufacturing system and costs to phase out certain products 
two plants acquired in the sure grow merger and the scott  mississippi delinting plant the company s oldest  least efficient plant have been idled 
the company plans to reduce its domestic work force in total by up to  including those affected by the plant closings  by offering an early retirement program to all employees who meet certain age and years of service criteria 
the company expects the production and cost optimization plan  after its full implementation in fiscal  to result in moderate savings in and up to  in savings in fiscal and annually thereafter 
d m international  llc  is a venture formed in through which d pl the managing member and monsanto plan to introduce in combination d pl s acid delinting technology and monsanto s bollgard gene technology 
in november  d m international  llc formed a subsidiary  d pl china pte ltd 
d pl china 
in november  d pl china concluded negotiations with parties in hebei province  one of the major cotton producing regions in the people s republic of china  to form hebei ji dai cotton seed technology company ltd 
ji dai  a joint venture controlled by d pl china 
in june  ji dai commenced construction of a new cotton seed conditioning and storage facility in hebei  china  under terms of the joint venture agreement 
the new facility is expected to be completed in november during the growing season  the joint venture harvested sufficient seed assuming normal production runs to produce seed sufficient to plant up to  acres of bollgard cotton in hebei in the company reached an agreement with parties in zimbabwe to form a joint venture that will provide high quality acid delinted seed to farmers in zimbabwe 
initially  the plant will continue to process and sell locally developed and owned varieties which will be genetically transformed so they contain the bollgard gene technology and potentially other technologies developed in the future 
the introduction of these technologies into locally developed germplasm is expected to provide both large commercial growers as well as the small communal growers a significant economic advantage over those who don t use these technologies 
this project is presently on hold pending zimbabwean government approval 
the company and parties in latin america are negotiating to form joint ventures that will process locally  and or form distributorships that will import  acid delinted cotton seed for sale in certain latin america countries 
initial plans call for the introduction of d pl transgenic varieties which have already performed well in these countries as well as the transformation of locally developed germplasm into varieties that contain the bollgard gene technology and potentially other new technologies 
the ventures will also evaluate for suitability d pl germplasm developed in the southern hemisphere and elsewhere 
the company s recently completed delinting plants in south africa and argentina processed for the first time foundation seed grown in these countries 
such seed was exported to the us for sale in the spring of the use of southern hemisphere winter nurseries and seed production programs such as these can dramatically accelerate the introduction of new varieties since d pl can raise at least two crops per year by taking advantage of the southern hemisphere growing season 
through these locations  the company is also evaluating local market opportunities for the company s cotton and  where feasible  soybean seed varieties 
the results of operations of d pl s wholly owned australian subsidiary continue to be disappointing 
although the company began selling seed containing the bollgard gene ingard tm in australia in  operating results and product market share remain at unacceptable levels 
the company  through its australian operations  is identifying smaller potential export markets for the company s products throughout southeast asia 
the adaptability of the company s germplasm must be evaluated before such sales can be made and the recent instability of the economies in some of the countries in this region will make successful market development a challenge 
the company s reorganization of its business among its key operating units including deltapine  paymaster which includes the stripper varieties acquired in and the hartz varieties acquired in  sure grow and international  has been in effect for over one year now 
this new structure has created healthy competition among the brands  particularly in the sales and research and development areas 
in  the company s total operating expenses increased to million before special charges  from million  before special charges  in and million in international operating expenses are expected to increase about million in due to new international ventures and domestic operating expenses are expected to increase about million 
the company s ability to achieve its domestic financial targets will be dependent on the total planted acres of cotton  the number of acres planted with cotton seed containing the bollgard and roundup ready technologies either in a single gene construct or in a stacked gene combination  the successful conversion of the stripper markets in the high plains and additional soybean seed sales of conventional and roundup ready varieties 
the major capital improvement program started in to more efficiently and effectively process and handle the company s products is now complete 
the major projects completed in fiscal include the purchase and implementation of a fully integrated process manufacturing system that will process data for all functional areas of the company  a major computer hardware upgrade in with another planned in the first quarter of  as well as precision electronic seed treating equipment at three locations and a new international and administrative office building at the company headquarters in scott  mississippi 
in  domestic capital investment is expected to return to about million 
offshore investments  which will be financed in part by d pl s technology and joint venture partners  are expected to range from million to million although this range could change depending on the outcome and timing of various projects 
the company is currently addressing its year computer software issues and has formulated a plan to resolve these matters 
management believes the company s applications on operating systems software will be year compliant before the company expects no material costs or interruptions to its operations because a significant portion of the company s software was replaced by the purchase of computer software that is already year compliant 
net sales and licensing fees in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million  from sales of million 
this increase is primarily the result of increased bollgard licensing fees over and licensing fees received from the first sale of commercial quantities of roundup ready cotton seed 
domestic picker cotton seed unit sales decreased by while domestic stripper cotton seed units increased due to the conversion of the high plains market despite a reduction in the total number of cotton acres planted in the us to million from million 
net billable bollgard acres increased to million in from million in net billable roundup ready acres were million in soybean unit sales also increased over primarily due to an increase in planted acres which resulted in part from cold  wet weather during early in the planting season when cotton is typically planted and higher soybean prices 
international sales increased to million in from million in  primarily attributable to licensing fees received from sales in australia and mexico of d pl s nucotn varieties containing monsanto s bt gene  the positive effects of which were partly offset by reduced export sales 
in  consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million  from sales of million 
this increase is primarily the result of bollgard licensing fees received from the first year of commercial sales of nucotn 
there was also an increase in soybean sales of and an increase in commercialization fees of million in over the million received in the effects of these positive developments were partially offset by a decrease in domestic cotton seed unit sales resulting from a reduction in the number of total cotton acres planted in the us to million from million 
in  the dynamics of the freedom to farm bill coupled with higher corn prices contributed to the decline in cotton acreage 
international sales increased to million in from million in sales in mexico  in  increased million as a result of the mexican government s favorable agricultural policy toward cotton  and the growth of its textile industry as a result of the north american free trade agreement 
in  sales in greece increased million due to the continued success of d pl s cotton varieties in the northern growing areas of that country 
sales in turkey were essentially unchanged from levels 
gross profit d pl s consolidated gross profit after special charges was million in compared to million in special charges of million were recorded in as a result of the optimization program discussed in item  the negative impact of which was offset by increased unit sales and increased licensing fees 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales before special charges was consistent between and consolidated gross profit increased in to million from million in this increase is primarily attributable to nucotn sales and the related bollgard licensing fees 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decline in gross margin results from recording the bollgard licensing fees charged to the grower as a component of sales  net of estimated distributor and dealer commissions  coupled with recording the due to d pl s technology partner as a component of cost of sales with the residual included as gross profit 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of additional transgenic costs associated with evaluation of new technologies  transformation of the company s sure grow and paymaster product lines  increased technical service department costs  increased varietal testing in certain international markets and further expansion of research programs related to international activities 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in research and development costs was primarily the result of the addition of the hartz research program  added technical service department costs  additional transgenic costs and increased international activities 
selling expenses selling expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the expansion of sales and marketing departments for the paymaster division and the international division  primarily australia

primary earnings per share before special charges were   and in  and  respectively 
primary earnings per share after special charges were   and in  and  respectively 
the number of shares deemed outstanding for those periods increased because of additional stock option grants and or the exercise of such options pursuant to the stock option plan and the long term incentive plan 
furthermore  the effect of all stock splits through november  are included in these earnings per share calculations 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
the company maintains credit facilities  uses early payments by customers and uses cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
for more than years d pl has borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
d pl purchases seed from contract growers in its first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal borrowings normally commence in the first fiscal quarter and peak in the third fiscal quarter 
loan repayments normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
d pl also offers distributors  dealers and farmers financial incentives to make early payments 
in fiscal  d pl received approximately million in early payments 
to the extent d pl attracts early payments from customers  bank borrowings under the credit facility are reduced 
the company records receivables for technology fees on bollgard and roundup ready seed sales as the seed is shipped  usually in the company s second and third quarters 
the company has contracted the billing and collection activities for bollgard and roundup ready seed technology fees to monsanto 
in september  the technology fees are due at which time d pl receives payment from monsanto 
d pl then pays monsanto its royalty for the bollgard and roundup ready technology fees 
the company borrows funds from a financial institution to meet its working capital needs 
this agreement provides a core commitment of million and a seasonal commitment of million 
the core commitment is a long term loan that may be borrowed upon at any time and is due january  the seasonal commitment is a working capital loan that may be drawn upon from september through june of each fiscal year and expires january  each commitment offers variable and fixed interest rate options and requires the company to pay facility or commitment fees and to comply with certain financial covenants 
at august   the company had  available for borrowing under both facilities 
the financial covenants under the loan agreements require the company to a maintain minimum tangible net worth in an amount not less than million increased by of net income each fiscal year  at august   b not allow the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as defined  to exceed to  and c maintain a cash flow coverage ratio of at least to at august   the company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth exceeded the permitted ratio 
the financial institution waived compliance with this covenant 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively and increased due to a capital improvement program commenced in the expenditures exclude acquisitions which aggregated million 
this investment strategy included the commencement in of a special million upgrade of d pl s bulk seed stabilization  storage  handling and processing facilities at three of its cotton seed plants 
in addition  a cotton seed processing plant acquired in the paymaster acquisition has been technologically upgraded 
projects completed in include a new fully integrated computer system  the commencement of construction of seed storage conditioning and delinting facilities in china  expansion of facilities in argentina and south africa and construction of a new international and administrative office building 
management believes that domestic capital expenditures will approximate million in  excluding expected capital expenditures for foreign joint ventures which will be funded by cash from operations  borrowings or investments from joint venture partners  as necessary 
capital expenditures for international ventures are expected to range from million to million depending on the timing and outcome of such projects 
cash provided from operations  early payments from customers and borrowings under the loan agreement should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
the company is currently negotiating a million senior credit facility with its existing lender and two participating institutions 
the planned facility will include a million core facility due in and a million seasonal facility available september through june each year  also due in the new agreement will have covenants and pricing structures similar to the existing agreements 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  existing products  technical developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include those noted elsewhere in this item and the following domestic demand for d pl s seed will continue to be affected by government programs and  most importantly  by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
the planting seed market is highly competitive and d pl varieties face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified chemical companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
a number of chemical and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products 
the company s seed products may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of the company s competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than the company 
overall profitability will depend on weather conditions  government policies in all countries where the company sells products  worldwide commodity prices  the company s ability to successfully open new international markets  the company s ability to successfully continue development of the high plains market  the technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval and maintain such approval for existing and for additional biotechnology products on which they and the company are working and the company s ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to successfully complete these projects may affect future profitability 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which the company operates and because of factors within the particular international markets targeted by the company  international profitability and growth may be less stable than domestic profitability and growth have been in the past
