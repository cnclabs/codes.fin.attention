operating results in the forthcoming year will be influenced by the ability of current tenants to continue paying rent  and the company s ability to renew expiring tenant leases and obtain new leases at competitive rental rates 
it has been the intention of the company since its inception to be essentially self liquidating 
while there are no legal requirements that the company be liquidated by a particular date or within any particular time frame  the original expectation was that the company would be liquidated ten years following the stock offering completed in the manner in which the liquidation was intended to be accomplished was by eventually selling the assets and distributing to shareholders the net cash proceeds 
there are several options available to the company and the board of directors has begun exploring the various possibilities

in  hewlett packard contributed rents of  rental income at southpoint decreased by  during due to tenants vacating their space upon lease expiration 
this was offset by an increase in rental income at broadbent and germantown of  and  respectively  due to increased rental rates at both properties and improved occupancy at broadbent

funds from operations  as used in this report  is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation 
the company has adopted this definition of funds from operations as a more meaningful measurement of the ongoing performance of a real estate entity than either net cash provided by operating activities  identified in the statements of cash flows  or earnings from operations  identified in the statements of earnings 
funds from operations takes into consideration the accrual of revenue and expenses which more appropriately reflects operating performance 
net cash provided by operating activities  on the other hand  represents cash receipts and disbursements without regard to when income is earned or expense incurred 
earnings from operations considers the accrual of revenue and expenses  but is limited as a measurement of the ongoing performance of a real estate entity because it includes depreciation  a non cash expense 
the company intends to continue using funds from operations as a measure of operating performance 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital resources consist of its current equity in real estate investments current value less mortgage indebtedness and a participation in a mortgage loan receivable 
the company maintains the real estate in good condition and provides adequate insurance coverage 
liquidity is considered sufficient to meet current obligations  and is represented by cash and cash equivalents of  and a mortgage loan participation of  as of december  net cash provided by operating activities  as shown in the statements of cash flows  was  for the year ended december  the major uses of cash in were dividends to shareholders of  and capital expenditures of  at corporate center east in order to acquire a tenant 
dividends to shareholders of  were also paid in the first quarter of the board of directors continues to closely monitor occupancies  leasing activity  overall company operations  and liquidity in determining quarterly dividends 
the company s debt service commitments for the mortgage loan payable are described in note to the financial statements 
in addition  the company anticipates incurring lease commissions  tenant improvements and capital expenditures of  for releasing the remaining space at corporate center east in and  for leasing an additional  square feet to an existing tenant at southpoint in there were no other material commitments at december  inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past few years have favorably impacted the company s operations by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation has the indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
the company s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
these factors  in the long run  are expected to result in more attractive returns from the company s real estate portfolio as compared to short term investment vehicles
