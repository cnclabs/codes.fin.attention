item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
the risk factors described below contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the purpose of the following discussion is to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial condition of the company  including changes arising from recent acquisitions by the company  the timing and nature of which have significantly affected the company s results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of the form k 
general during the current fiscal year  the company changed its strategic direction by pursuing consolidation of the scrap metal recycling business 
in conjunction with this new strategy  the company divested its color printers and related businesses during the year by selling the spectra star videoshow businesses 
the operations of these businesses are treated as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements 
all prior year information has been restated to conform to reflect the results of the disposed businesses as discontinued operations 
in april  the company completed its first acquisition in the scrap metal recycling business by merging with emco 
this was followed by the acquisitions of macleod and houtex in january these transactions were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and their results are included in the company s consolidated results for the year ended march  from the time of acquisition 
on may   the company acquired reserve also to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
on may   the company executed a definitive agreement to merge a subsidiary of the company with cozzi 
in march  the company announced that it signed a binding letter of intent to acquire proler 
the cozzi and proler transactions are expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal and will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  but no assurance can be provided that either transaction will close 
fiscal year ended march  results of operations consolidated revenues for the year ended march  in broad product categories were as follows in thousands commodity weight amount ferrous metals tons   non ferrous metals pounds   other consolidated revenues for the year ended march  reflect twelve months of results for emco and three months for macleod and houtex  respectively 
revenues in the scrap metal industry during fiscal were negatively impacted by market conditions that reduced prices for scrap metals 
prices for ferrous scrap metals declined significantly in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  prices for non ferrous metals consisting principally of copper and aluminum also declined during fiscal the price of scrap metal is impacted by regional and seasonal variations 
furthermore  prices for scrap metal are also impacted by broad and global cyclical movements and as such equilibrates supply and demand 
the company believes one of the factors that contributed to the price decline in fiscal for nonferrous metals was the negative reaction caused by the much publicized speculative trading losses sustained by a major copper trader 
the company believes one of the factors that contributed to the price decline in ferrous metals during the third quarter was weaknesses in export markets for ferrous metals 
consolidated gross margin for fiscal was million  or of net sales 
as indicated above  gross margins for scrap processors were negatively impacted in fiscal by general declines in scrap prices 
gross margins were also impacted by losses at the company s emco subsidiary 
during the third quarter  the company initiated efforts to restructure the operations at emco and intends to reduce future operating expenses through the restructuring plan 
no provisions were recorded on the balance sheet for the restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are being expensed as incurred 
for further discussion  see section entitled factors affecting future results and accuracy of forward looking statements 
consolidated operating expenses of million consists of general and administrative costs of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
approximately million of the general and administrative costs represents corporate overhead 
as mentioned earlier  the company s emco subsidiary has initiated an operational restructuring plan that management believes will reduce certain overhead expenses 
net interest and other expense for the year was million 
this was comprised of million in interest expense  offset by 
million in interest income and 
million of other income 
in the prior fiscal years  the company had excess cash invested in government and corporate bonds which generated interest income for the company 
during the current fiscal year  the company began to incur interest expense associated with the financing of its acquisitions 
see the section titled liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
net loss from continuing operations was million 
per share 
the net loss from continuing operations was mainly due to losses incurred at the company s emco subsidiary and corporate overhead costs  partially offset by operating income at the company s houtex and macleod subsidiaries 
the financial results for houtex and macleod are only included from their acquisition dates in january losses at emco were mainly due to unfavorable market conditions  inefficient operating processes and inefficient machinery and equipment 
income from discontinued operations was  
per share 
during the fiscal year  the company realized an after tax gain  including royalty income of  of  on the sale of assets of the spectra star and videoshow businesses 
the results of discontinued operations reflect the operations of the spectra star business up to the divestiture date july  as well as severance and other costs incurred to discontinue the business 
severance costs were not material to the company 
fiscal to fiscal fiscal represents the five month period from november  to march  net loss from continuing operations represents certain corporate overhead costs offset by interest income and a tax benefit 
interest and other income remained consistent during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest and other income was  for the five months ended march   an average of  per month compared to interest and other income of  for fiscal  an average of  per month 
income from discontinued operations was  
per share for the five months ended march   versus a loss of million 
per share in fiscal fiscal results reflect one time charges of million relating to restructuring of the color printer business and the discontinuance of a portion of the electronic presentation business 
the results for fiscal were impacted by lower shipments of the company s products due to competitive pressures in the market 
this was slightly offset by lower operating expenses as a result of planned reductions in payroll and related expenditures as well as less time and costs spent by the company on research and development 
fiscal to fiscal income from continuing operations of  
per share represents interest income and a provision for income taxes 
interest income was  during fiscal  compared to  during fiscal the increase was primarily attributed to the recording of a loss during fiscal of  for certain of the company s investments 
loss from discontinued operations was million 
per share in fiscal versus a loss of  
per share in fiscal fiscal results reflect one time charges of approximately million relating to the restructuring of the color printer business and the discontinuance of a portion of the electronic presentation business 
without the one time charges  net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal would have been  the company s color printer business remained flat with the prior year 
the electronic presentation business experienced weakness due to competitive product pressures  softness in governmental purchases and lower sales outside the united states 
the company was able to control expenses through reductions in staff and less time and costs spent on research and development 
liquidity and capital resources as previously discussed  the company will continue to pursue acquisitions in the scrap metal recycling industry and anticipates financing acquisitions with debt and equity transactions 
the company will require substantial capital to fund future acquisitions and current operations 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available  or  in the event that it is  that it will be available in the amounts and on terms acceptable to the company 
cash flows from continuing operations the company s net cash flows from continuing operations decreased significantly during fiscal as a result of significant losses incurred by emco and an increase in accounts receivable balances as a result of the acquisitions of emco  macleod and houtex 
cash flows from investing activities the company made capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal which included purchases of property and equipment million and cash paid for the acquisitions of emco  macleod and houtex million 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million of proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities 
management anticipates continuing to make acquisitions  capital expenditures for new equipment  and upgrading and expanding existing equipment and facilities 
the company expects that these expenditures may increase in the future due to the internal growth of the company and business combinations 
cash flows from financing activities during fiscal  the company obtained million from issuances of term debt 
million of the term debt is due on june   but may be extended at the company s option and for a fee  to july  proceeds from the term debt were utilized to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and make payments on existing debt 
the company also made net payments of  on its various lines of credits 
at march   the company had utilized predominately all the availability under its lines of credit 
management anticipates obtaining additional debt financing to fund its acquisition strategy as well as provide additional working capital for its existing operations 
see factors affecting future results and accuracy of forward looking statements immediate and future capital requirements  short term borrowing strategies to fund acquisitions  and substantial leverage 
cash flows from discontinued operations the company generated million of cash flows from discontinued operations during fiscal the cash flows generated are a result of proceeds received from the sale of assets of the spectra star business  royalty income received from the sale of products from the discontinued businesses and collection of accounts receivable related to the discontinued operations 
financial condition the company s principal sources of cash are its existing cash and cash equivalents balances  collection of accounts receivable and proceeds from lines of credit and other borrowing agreements 
at march   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
significant cash transactions subsequent to year end on june   the company concluded its private sale of  shares of restricted common stock which to date has raised approximately million in cash 
the company expects to receive an additional million from the collection of a short term note provided by a purchaser of common stock in the private placement 
in connection with the company s acquisition of reserve on may   a cash payment of million was made 
cash requirements for maturing debt obligations the company has a loan from a commercial bank in the principal amount of million million is currently outstanding which is due and payable on june   but can be extended  at the company s option  to july   for a fee 
the company also has an million line of credit million is currently outstanding and available which matures in august in connection with the reserve acquisition  the company assumed certain debt of approximately million of which million is currently outstanding 
the company made arrangements with reserve s lender to provide for the existing loans to remain in place without changes to terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
cash requirements for pending acquisitions the cozzi and proler acquisitions will require cash payments to sellers at closing of approximately million and million  respectively 
both acquisitions are expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal  although no assurance can be provided that either transaction will close 
the company s existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the cozzi and proler acquisitions 
the company is seeking other financing sources to meet such obligations but no assurances can be provided that such financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  it will be on satisfactory terms 
see business recent developments 
working capital availability and requirements accounts receivable balances increased from million at march  to million at march  the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to the acquisitions of emco  macleod and houtex  offset by collections of accounts receivable from the spectra star business 
accounts payable increased from million at march  to million at march  the increase in accounts payable is attributable to the acquisitions of emco  macleod and houtex 
inventory levels vary at each of the company s subsidiaries 
inventory levels are determined by managers of subsidiaries and can vary significantly between subsidiaries 
inventory on hand at march  consisted of the following in thousands commodity weight amount ferrous tons   non ferrous pounds   other the company expects to make substantial investments in additional equipment and property for expansion  for replacement of assets  and in connection with future acquisitions 
in particular  the company s emco subsidiary requires substantial capital investment to replace old equipment and to put into service additional processing equipment 
the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries have various revolving lines of credit with commercial lenders which provide for revolving credit at interest rates that range from to in excess of the lenders prime rates 
the company s ability to borrow under the lines of credit is based primarily on its accounts receivable and inventory balances 
as of march   the company had fully drawn predominately all of the availability under the lines of credit 
the lines expire at various dates through august on may   the company entered into a million revolving and term loan agreement with a commercial bank under which the company received proceeds of million which is due on july  that loan has an interest rate equal to above the lenders prime rate 
the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding at march  was 
average borrowings under the various lines of credit during fiscal were approximately million 
during fiscal  amounts outstanding under the various lines of credit ranged from million to million 
scrap metal recycling companies have substantial ongoing working capital and capital equipment requirements in order to continue to operate and grow 
for example  through march   the company advanced approximately million to its emco subsidiary for short term working capital requirements 
as a result  the company will seek equity or debt financing to fund future improvements and expansion of its scrap metal recycling business as well as to make other acquisitions of scrap metal recycling facilities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  it will be on satisfactory terms 
the failure to obtain financing may cause the company to default on certain existing debt obligations and would hinder the company s ability to make continued investments in capital equipment and pursue expansions  which could materially adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 
any equity financing which is undertaken would result in dilution to the then existing stockholders of the company 
see factors influencing future results risk of dilution to existing stockholders 
factors influencing future results and accuracy of forward looking statements in the normal course of its business  the company  in an effort to help keep its stockholders and the public informed about the company s operations  may from time to time issue or make certain statements  either in writing or orally  that are or contain forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the us federal securities laws 
generally  these statements relate to business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions made by or to be made by the company  or projections involving anticipated revenues  earnings  or other aspects of operating results 
the words expect  believe  anticipate  project  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company cautions readers that such statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of factors that may tend to influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based  including but not limited to those discussed below 
as noted elsewhere in this report  all phases of the company s operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks  and other influences  many of which are outside the control of the company  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of the company s operations and whether forward looking statements made by the company ultimately prove to be accurate 
the following discussion outlines certain factors that could affect the company s consolidated results of operations for fiscal and beyond and cause them to differ materially from those that may be set forth in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
general the company s board of directors intends to actively pursue acquisitions and mergers in scrap metal recycling 
depending on the nature and size of potential acquisitions  mergers and other transactions  if any  the company s cash flows from operating and investing activities  together with its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may not be sufficient in the future 
therefore  the company will have to supplement these sources of liquidity with additional sources of funds such as borrowings or stock offerings 
no assurance can be provided that such financing will be available or available on reasonable terms 
recent change in strategic direction and limited operating history in the past year  the company has undergone a significant change in strategic direction and emphasis 
immediately prior to april   the company s business had consisted of designing  manufacturing and marketing color printers and related consumables  including ribbons  transparencies and paper 
then  on april   the company acquired emco  which was engaged in scrap metal recycling 
on july   the company sold to mannesmann tally the inventory and related production equipment of its spectra star printer and consumables business 
this was followed by the acquisitions of macleod  houtex and reserve 
the company anticipates future acquisitions of other companies in the scrap metal recycling industry 
reflective of the company s overall change in emphasis is its corporate name change on april   from general parametrics corporation gpc to metal management  inc given the substantial changes in the company s business in the past year  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance 
potential purchasers should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
prior to the emco merger in april  the company had no history of operations in the scrap metal recycling industry 
the acquired companies have not previously operated as subsidiaries of a public holding company subject to formal accounting and reporting requirements 
consequently  in order to transition the acquired companies  the company will have to establish information systems  internal controls  and hire managers with appropriate skills to insure the timeliness and accuracy of financial reports 
during fiscal the company announced restatement of certain financial results due to accounting errors at its emco subsidiary 
in addition  the acquired companies have historically been organized in a manner in which its management and ownership were the same 
the management of the acquired companies have not previously reported to management responsible for diverse operations and have had limited experience in executing consolidation strategies on the scale being pursued by the company 
furthermore  the success of the consolidation strategy is dependent in part on the ability of the company s management to oversee diverse operations and to successfully integrate processing  marketing and other resources of the acquired companies 
the company s management team has not previously had experience in such capacity 
immediate and future capital requirements the company is pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy which requires substantial amounts of capital 
for example  to accomplish the acquisitions of cozzi and proler  the company will need to obtain million to fund the cash portions of purchase consideration 
the cozzi merger agreement also requires the company to either have received a capital infusion or a commitment be made for a capital infusion of million on terms acceptable to the cozzi shareholders 
the company is evaluating various financing strategies and alternatives to obtain sufficient capital to close the acquisition of cozzi and proler and to provide working capital support and to fund future acquisitions  however  no assurance can be provided that sufficient funds on acceptable terms will become available 
failure to raise sufficient capital to close the cozzi and proler  or other acquisitions could adversely affect the company and its stock price 
short term borrowing strategies to fund acquisitions the company intends to continue an acquisition strategy which will utilize seller note obligations with short term as well as long term maturities 
the issuances of seller notes may provide restrictive covenants on the company 
for example  the seller notes issued to acquire houtex and macleod provided restrictions on the ability of the company to unilaterally direct or control the operations of houtex or macleod until the seller notes were repaid 
the seller notes issued to houtex and macleod also provided pledges of the stock of the acquired entities and certain other restrictive covenants 
no assurance can be provided that the company will access capital on acceptable terms in adequate time frames to repay seller note obligations issued in the future 
an inability to repay seller note obligations would have adverse consequences to the company 
subsequent to closing the houtex and macleod acquisitions  and prior to the various maturity dates on the seller notes issued in the acquisitions of macleod and houtex  the company arranged for funds to be available to repay principal and interest on such seller notes 
however  no assurance can be provided that the company will be able to pay future seller notes when due 
the company has provided a million note payable to certain sellers of reserve 
the note is due on may  and places restrictions on the ability of the company to unilaterally direct or control the operations of reserve until the note is repaid 
the million seller note to reserve is secured by a stock pledge agreement 
substantial leverage as a result of the recent mergers and acquisitions  the company  as of march   had approximately million in consolidated liabilities owed either to the sellers of the company s completed acquisitions or to third parties 
in particular  the company issued an aggregate of approximately million principal amount in promissory notes to the sellers of macleod and houtex 
all seller notes payable to the former shareholders of macleod and houtex which became payable were extinguished through payments made in march  april and may and the execution of a note for million due in million of promissory notes were issued in connection with the reserve acquisition  which are due in may in order to pursue expansion and acquisition opportunities  the company expects to incur additional debt  either through bank or credit lines or the sale of debt securities in registered or unregistered transactions  in addition to additional equity financing it may undertake 
the servicing of such present and future debt of the company will utilize cash either in the form of cash on hand or cash generated by operating and financing activities 
as of march   the company had a debt to equity ratio of 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have adverse consequences to the company including the following the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest  and the company will be more vulnerable to an economic downturn in the scrap metal recycling industry which has historically been sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
risk of expansion and consolidation strategies the company currently plans to continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the scrap metal recycling industry 
there can be no assurance that any previously announced or unannounced mergers will be consummated nor that  if they are  the company will be able to effectively manage disparate business enterprises 
the ability of the company to achieve its expansion objectives and to manage its growth effectively depends on a variety of factors  including the ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets and to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition  the integration of new businesses into the company s operations and the availability of capital 
the inability to control or manage growth effectively or to successfully integrate future new business into the company s operations would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully expand or that growth and expansion will result in profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to realize any of the other anticipated benefits of future mergers or acquisitions that it may undertake or achieve its financial goals and operational objectives in execution of its consolidation strategy 
company management factors due to the limited experience of the company s management in the scrap metal recycling business  the company relies substantially on the scrap metal recycling experience of the current management teams at each of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
while certain of the management personnel of the acquired facilities have executed employment agreements  there can be no assurance that such personnel will continue to serve at the acquired businesses 
the loss of a significant number of management personnel of the company s acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company s efforts to effectively manage and integrate these operations 
in addition  the loss of executive officers of the company would also adversely impact the company s performance and ability to successfully expand the business 
a condition of the cozzi merger agreement contemplates the company appointing albert a 
cozzi to be the president and chief operating officer of the company 
while mr 
cozzi has substantial experience in the scrap metal industry and would be an important part of the company s senior management team  no assurance can be provided that the cozzi merger will close 
potential changes in management and governance changes in management upon the closing of the cozzi merger  material changes will occur in the management and governance structure of the company 
the cozzi merger agreement contemplates that t 
benjamin jennings will remain as the chairman of the board and chief development officer of the company  gerard m 
jacobs will remain as chief executive officer of the company  robert c 
larry will remain as chief financial officer of the company  and albert a 
cozzi will be appointed president and chief operating officer of the company 
in addition  the cozzi merger agreement contemplates that an executive committee will be formed comprised of messrs 
albert a 
cozzi  jacobs  jennings  and possibly other individuals 
the company has not previously operated with a chief operating officer or with an executive committee 
there can be no assurance that these changes in management structure will be successful in carrying out the acquisition and operating plans of the company 
changes in governance upon the closing of the cozzi merger  the cozzi merger agreement contemplates that the company s board of directors will likely be comprised of directors equally nominated by the shareholders of cozzi and by messrs 
jacobs and jennings 
the cozzi merger agreement contemplates that two outside directors will be nominated who are mutually agreeable to both sides of the cozzi merger 
the cozzi merger is an example of the willingness of the company to rapidly change the management and governance of the company  if necessary or desirable 
no assurance can be provided that the proposed changes in management and governance as contemplated in the cozzi merger agreement will occur or that a subsequent acquisition or merger will not similarly change the management and governance structure of the company nor can there be assurance that any changes to the corporate governance will be advantageous to the company 
control of company by management  principal stockholders and members of the board of directors as a result of the mergers and acquisition  messrs 
jacobs and jennings  together with other members of the board of directors  have sufficient voting power to control the outcome of all matters including the election of directors and future mergers  acquisitions or sale of assets submitted to stockholders for approval and may be deemed to have effective control over the affairs and management of the company 
messrs 
jacobs and jennings along with the existing members of the board of directors of the company  currently beneficially own approximately of the company s common stock on a fully diluted basis 
to date  the directors of the company have voted in support of initiatives recommended by messrs 
jacobs and jennings 
there can be no assurance that such support will continue in the future with respect to voting by directors 
the cozzi merger  if consummated  will result in ownership of the company s common stock on a fully diluted basis by management  principal stockholders and current and former members of the board of directors which further concentrates ownership and control among principals of the company 
impact of the cozzi definitive agreements on management of the company and strategic actions considered by the company prior to closing of the cozzi merger on may   the company executed a definitive agreement to merge a subsidiary of the company with cozzi 
the definitive agreement requires the company to seek approval from cozzi shareholders prior to executing certain strategic actions up to the closing of the cozzi merger or termination thereof 
actions that require approval by the cozzi shareholders included but are not limited to amendments to or changes of the company s charter or bylaws 
issuance of equity  except those contemplated by section b of the merger agreement 
changes in management of the company or changes in the compensation provided to officers and directors of the company 
acquisitions of companies  except those contemplated by section e of the merger agreement 
incurrence of any indebtedness or other significant financing transactions 
no assurance can be provided that the cozzi merger will be consummated 
cyclicality of operating results the operating results of the scrap metal recycling processing industry in general  are highly cyclical in nature as they tend to reflect and amplify the general national economic condition 
in periods of national recession or periods of minimal economic growth  the operations of scrap metal recycling companies have been materially adversely affected 
during recessions or periods of minimal economic growth  the automobile and the construction industries typically experience major cutbacks in production  resulting in decreased demand for steel  copper and aluminum supplies 
for example  the scrap metal recycling industry was adversely affected for a period of five years from approximately to future economic downturns would materially and adversely affect the operating results of the company 
the ability of the company to withstand significant economic downturns in the future will depend in part on the amount of cash maintained and availability under lines of credit for the company 
recently  emco has required substantial cash infusions from the company 
the company believes that emco will require additional working capital funding during fiscal price fluctuations emco  macleod and houtex s results of operations have been in the past  and the results of operations of the overall company are expected to be  subject to price fluctuations that occur in the metals commodities markets 
for example  up to december   prices of non ferrous metals generally declined during the previous five quarters  which adversely affected revenues and net income through the third quarter of fiscal the fourth quarter of fiscal showed improvement for certain categories of scrap metal prices 
a further decline in commodity prices could further reduce revenues and net income prospectively 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity of the company 
dependence on scrap suppliers the company s scrap recycling operations are dependent upon the supply of scrap materials from its suppliers 
few of such suppliers are bound by long term supply arrangements  and therefore they have no obligation to continue to supply scrap materials to the company 
in the event that substantial numbers of scrap suppliers cease supplying scrap materials to the company  the financial condition and results of operations of the company would be materially and adversely affected 
concentration of customers and credit risk customers represented of revenues for the year ended march  these customers comprised approximately of accounts receivable at march  the company s largest customer accounted for of revenues and of accounts receivable for the year ended march  for the year ended december   cozzi generated approximately of its revenue from customers  including customer that accounted for of sales 
the loss of any one of the company s or cozzi s significant customers  if the cozzi merger is consummated  could affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentration of credit risk are primarily trade accounts receivable 
the company sells its products primarily to scrap metal brokers and steel mills located in the united states 
generally  the company does not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
historically  the company s wholly owned subsidiaries have not experienced material losses from the noncollection of receivables  however  certain of the company s subsidiaries have significant balances owing from customers that operate in cyclical industries and leveraged conditions which may impair the collectibility of receivables 
operating losses at emco emco has incurred operating losses and required capital infusions since the april merger 
management believes that the losses have resulted primarily from unfavorable market conditions in arizona  from operation of antiquated and inefficient machinery and equipment  from lack of certain machinery and equipment  and from certain operational issues 
in october  in an effort to abate such operating losses  the company initiated efforts to restructure the operations of its emco subsidiary 
the restructuring has reduced expenses by primarily eliminating the utilization of certain leased equipment  eliminating jobs representing approximately of the workforce  and reducing the cost of outside processing from certain vendors 
in addition  as a part of the restructuring program  emco management initiated a review of the buying and selling departments 
the company is not certain whether it will be able to accomplish a successful restructuring of emco s business 
see recent change in strategic direction and limited operating history 
as part of the cozzi merger  the company will own of a joint venture owned by cozzi in phoenix  arizona 
it is the company s intention to acquire the remaining interest in the joint venture and combine the operations of the cozzi joint venture with the emco operations 
there can be no assurance that the cozzi transaction will close nor if the cozzi transaction closes  that the company will be successful in acquiring the other interest in the joint venture 
nor can any assurance be provided that any integration or consolidation of emco s business with cozzi will be successful 
risk of dilution to existing stockholders the company s strategy of expansion and additional acquisitions will require it to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock as consideration for additional acquisitions 
common stock may be issued at a discount to the market price and issuance of a material amount of common stock or such securities would result in significant dilution to the then existing stockholders of the company 
for example  the cozzi merger  if consummated  will result in the issuance of an additional million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase at least million shares of common stock 
the company expects to be required to seek equity financing to meet future capital requirements  which would also result in additional dilution 
see immediate and future capital requirements 
volatility of stock price the company s stock price has been  and in the future is expected to be  volatile and to experience market fluctuation as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  merger and acquisition announcements and developments  current and anticipated results of operations  future product offerings by the company or its competitors and factors unrelated to the operating performance of the company 
the trading price of the company s common stock may also vary as a result of changes in the business  operations  or financial results of the company  prospects of general market and economic conditions  additional future proposed acquisitions by the company and other factors 
failure in any quarter to meet the investment community s revenues or earnings expectations  if any  could have an adverse impact on the company s stock price  as could sales of large amounts of stock by existing stockholders 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the event the market price were adversely affected by such sales  the company s access to equity capital markets could be adversely affected and issuances of common stock by mtlm in connection with acquisitions  or otherwise  could dilute future earnings per share 
management believes that the investment public has factored the closing of the cozzi and proler mergers as well as potential future acquisitions into the company s current stock price 
if the cozzi  proler or any future acquisitions do not close  an adverse impact may occur on the company s stock price 
environmental matters comprehensive regulatory requirements the company and its subsidiaries are subject to significant government regulation including stringent environmental laws and regulations 
among other things  these laws and regulations impose comprehensive local  state  federal  foreign and supranational statutory and regulatory requirements concerning  among other matters  the treatment  acceptance  identification  storage  handling  transportation and disposal of industrial by products  hazardous and solid waste materials  waste water  stormwater effluent  air emissions  soil contamination  surface and ground water pollution  employee health and safety  operating permit standards  monitoring and spill containment requirements  zoning  and land use  among others 
various laws and regulations set prohibitions or limits on the release of contaminants into the environment 
such laws and regulations also require permits to be obtained and manifests to be completed and delivered in connection with any shipment of prescribed materials so that the movement and disposal of such material can be traced and the persons responsible for any mishandling of such material can be identified 
this regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens  costs and risks on the company and its subsidiaries 
violation of such laws and regulations may give rise to significant liability of the company  including fines  damages  fees and expenses 
releases of certain industrial by products and waste materials are subject to particular laws and regulations 
while the specific provisions of releases related laws and regulations vary among jurisdictions  such laws and regulations typically require that the relevant authorities be notified promptly  that the release be cleaned up promptly  and that remedial action be taken by the responsible party and or owner of the site to restore the environment to levels protective of human health and the environment 
generally  the governmental authorities are empowered to act to clean up and remediate releases and environmental damage and to charge the costs of such cleanup to one or more of the owners of the property  the person responsible for the spill  the generator of the contaminant and certain other parties or to direct the responsible party to take such action 
such authorities may also impose a tax or other liens to secure such parties reimbursement obligations 
environmental laws and regulations impose strict operational requirements on the performance of certain aspects of hazardous or toxic substances remedial work 
these requirements specify complex methods for identification  monitoring  storage  treatment and disposal of waste materials managed during a project 
failure to meet these requirements could result in substantial fines and other penalties 
environmental legislation and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and it is likely that the company and its subsidiaries will be subject to even more stringent environmental standards in the future 
for example  the ultimate effect of the regulations to be implemented under the clean air act amendments of the clean air act on the company and its subsidiaries  and the actual amount of any capital expenditures required thereby  will depend on how the clean air act is interpreted and implemented pursuant to regulations that are currently being developed and on such additional factors as the evolution of environmental control technologies and the economic viability of such operations at the time 
for these reasons  future capital expenditures for environmental control facilities cannot be predicted with accuracy  however  one may expect that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and that the expenditures necessary to comply with them could increase substantially 
local  state  federal  foreign and supranational governments and agencies have also from time to time proposed or adopted other types of laws  regulations or initiatives with respect to the scrap metal recycling industry 
included among them are laws  regulations and initiatives intended to ban or restrict the intrastate  interstate or international shipment of wastes  to impose higher taxes or fees on certain shipments of waste  or to classify or reclassify certain categories of non hazardous wastes as hazardous 
certain local  state  federal  foreign and international governments and agencies have promulgated flow control or other regulations  which attempt to require that all waste or certain types of waste generated within the jurisdiction in question must go to certain disposal sites 
from time to time legislation is considered that would enable or facilitate such laws  regulations or initiatives 
due to the complexity of regulation of the industry and to public and political pressure  implementation of existing or future laws  regulations or initiatives by different levels of governments may be inconsistent and are difficult to foresee 
the principal services of the company and its subsidiaries are detailed in and regulated by various permits and licenses governing their scrap metal recycling operations 
government agencies continually monitor the performance of a permit or license holder in relation to the terms of its permit or license 
the company and its subsidiaries facilities are subject to periodic unannounced inspection by local  state and federal authorities to ensure compliance with permit and license terms and applicable laws and regulations 
the company and its subsidiaries work with the authorities to remedy any deficiencies found during such inspections 
if serious violations are found or deficiencies  if any  are not remedied  the company and its subsidiaries could incur substantial fines and could be required to close a site 
governmental authorities have a wide variety of powerful administrative enforcement actions and remedial orders available to them to cause compliance with environmental laws or to remedy or punish violations of such laws 
such orders may be directed to various parties  including present or former owners or operators of the concerned sites  or parties that have or had control over the sites 
in certain instances  fines and treble damages may be imposed 
in the event that administrative actions fail to cure a perceived problem or where the relevant regulatory agency so desires  an injunction or temporary restraining order or damages may be sought in a court proceeding 
some laws give private parties the right  in addition to existing common laws claims  to file claims for injunctive relief or damages against the owners or operators of the site 
the company believes that with heightened legal  political and citizen awareness and concerns  all companies in the scrap metal recycling industry may be faced  in the normal course of operating their businesses  with fines and penalties and the need to expend substantial funds for capital projects  remedial work and operating activities  such as environmental contamination monitoring  and related activities 
regulatory or technological developments relating to the environment may require companies engaged in the scrap metal recycling industry to modify  supplement or replace equipment and facilities at costs which may be substantial 
because the scrap metal recycling industry has the potential for discharge of materials into the environment  a material portion of the capital expenditures by the company and its subsidiaries is expected to relate  directly or indirectly  to such equipment and facilities 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict requirements of environmental laws and regulations  and enforcement policies will require even more significant capital investments in this regard 
due to the nature of the scrap metal recycling business  it is possible that inquiries or claims based upon environmental laws may be made in the future by governmental bodies or individuals against the company and any other scrap metal recycling entities that the company may acquire 
the location of the company s facilities in large urban areas may increase the risk of scrutiny and claims 
the company is unable to predict whether any such future inquiries or claims will in fact arise or the outcome of such matters 
additionally  it is not possible to predict the total size of all capital expenditures or the amount of any increases in operating costs or other expenses that may be incurred by the company to comply with the environmental requirements applicable to the company and its operations  or whether all such cost increases can be passed on to customers through product price increases 
moreover  environmental legislation has been enacted  and may in the future be enacted  to create liability for past actions that were lawful at the time taken but that have been found to affect the environment and to create public rights of action for environmental conditions and activities 
as is the case with scrap recyclers in general  if damage to persons or the environment has been caused  or is in the future caused  by hazardous materials activities of the company or its subsidiaries  the company or its subsidiaries may be fined and held liable for such damage 
in addition  the company and such subsidiaries may be required to remedy such conditions and or change procedures 
thus  there can be no assurance that potential liabilities  expenditures  fines and penalties associated with environmental laws and regulations will not be imposed on the company in the future or that such liabilities  expenditures  fines or penalties will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  public interest groups  local citizens  local municipalities and other persons or organizations may have a right to seek relief from court for purported violations of law 
in some jurisdictions  recourse to the courts for individuals under common law principles such as trespass or nuisance have been or may be enhanced by legislation providing members of the public with statutory rights of action to protect the environment 
in such cases  even if a scrap metals recycling facility is operated in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations  local citizens and other persons and organizations may seek compensation for damages caused by the operation of the facility 
in some cases  the operation of scrap metal recycling facilities is subjected to heightened public scrutiny because of residential or other non industrial property uses that have developed around such facilities 
so called not in my backyard nimby grass roots community opposition to such facilities can materially interfere with such facilities on going operations and growth 
significant potential environmental liability general the company and its subsidiaries are subject to potential liability and may also be required from time to time to clean up or take certain remediation action with regard to sites currently or formerly used in connection with their operations 
furthermore  the company and its subsidiaries may be required to pay for all or a portion of the costs of clean up or remediation at sites the company and its subsidiaries never owned or on which they never operated if they are found to have arranged for transportation  treatment or disposal of pollutants or hazardous substances on or to such sites 
the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to potential liability for environmental damage that their assets or operations may cause nearby landowners  particularly as a result of any contamination of drinking water sources or soil  including damage resulting from conditions existing prior to the acquisition of such assets or operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company  and could materially adversely affect the marketability and price of the company s stock 
risk factors include the following incompleteness of site investigations as part of its pre transaction due diligence investigations  the company typically hires an environmental consulting firm to conduct transaction screen reviews  or phase i and or phase ii site assessments of the sites owned or leased by particular acquisition or merger candidates the pre transaction site assessments 
however  such pre transaction site assessments have not covered and will not in the future cover all of the sites owned or leased by the companies which are acquired by or merge with the company or its subsidiaries 
moreover  such pre transaction site assessments which have occurred have not been designed or expected and will not in the future be designed or expected to disclose all material contamination that may be present 
for example  the company does not include soil sampling or core borings as a standard part of its pre transaction site assessments  even though such sampling and core borings might increase the chances of finding contamination on a particular site 
failure to conduct soil sampling and core borings on a particular site could result in the company failing to identify a seriously contaminated site prior to an acquisition or merger  and could materially adversely affect the company 
likelihood of contamination at some sites pre transaction site assessments of the company s current subsidiaries sites conducted by independent environmental consulting firms have revealed that some soil  surface water and or groundwater contamination is likely at certain of such sites  and have recommended that certain additional investigations and remediation be conducted 
based upon its review of these reports  the company believes that it is likely that contamination exists at certain of its subsidiaries sites and that it is likely that additional investigation  monitoring and remediation will be required at some of the sites 
also based upon its review of these reports  the company believes that such contamination is likely to include  but not be limited to polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  total petroleum hydrocarbons  volatile organic compounds vocs  antimony  arsenic  cadmium  copper  lead  mercury  silver  zinc  waste oil  toluene  meta and para xylenes  baghouse dust  and or aluminum dross 
the ultimate extent of such contamination cannot be stated with any certainty at this point  and there can be no assurance that the cost of remediation will be immaterial 
the existence of such contamination could result in federal  state  local or private enforcement or cost recovery actions against the company  possibly resulting in disruption of company operations  and substantial fines  penalties  damages  costs and expenses being imposed against the company and its subsidiaries 
the company has supplied its pre transaction site assessments to the management of its subsidiaries  who are responsible for reviewing them  examining ongoing operations  and taking any necessary steps to achieve and or maintain compliance with the environmental laws  including but not limited to any necessary remedial measures or operational changes 
the company expects to require future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of environmental liabilities 
no assurance can be provided that such costs will not be significant 
the company and its subsidiaries expect cash flows from operations to provide the funds for environmental capital  operating and remediation expenditures  however  no assurance can be given that such cash flows will be adequate for this purpose 
uncertain costs of environmental compliance and remediation it must be emphasized that  as a result of certain factors which impact upon the company and its subsidiaries future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements such as new local  state and federal laws and regulations  the developing nature of administrative standards promulgated under superfund and other environmental laws  and changing interpretations of such laws  uncertainty regarding adequate control levels  testing and sampling procedures  new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions  the incompleteness of information regarding the condition of certain sites  the lack of standards and information for use in the apportionment of remedial responsibilities  the numerous choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in remedial actions at such sites  the possible ability to recover indemnification or contribution from third parties  and the time periods over which eventual remediation may occur the estimated costs for future environmental compliance capital expenditures or increases in operating costs or other expenditures and remediation cannot be accurately predicted and are necessarily imprecise  however  such costs could be material to future quarterly or annual results of operations of the company 
in addition to not being possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental compliance and remediation  it is not possible to predict whether or not such costs can be passed on to customers through price increases 
lack of environmental impairment insurance the company and its subsidiaries do not carry environmental impairment liability insurance 
the company and its subsidiaries operate under general liability insurance policies  which company management considers to be adequate to protect the company and its subsidiaries assets and operations from other risks but which does not cover environmental damage 
if the company and its subsidiaries were to incur significant liability for environmental damage not covered by environmental impairment insurance  or for other claims in excess of its general liability insurance and umbrella coverage  the company s financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with certain by products while the majority of the company s metal products are currently exempt from applicable solid waste regulations  the scrap metal recycling operations of the company s subsidiaries produce significant amounts of by products 
heightened environmental risk is associated with certain of these by products for example  the company s emco subsidiary operates a shredder for which the primary feed materials are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances 
approximately twenty percent of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of material shredder fluff which remains after the segregation of ferrous and saleable non ferrous metals 
federal environmental regulations require shredder fluff to pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste 
the company s emco subsidiary endeavors to have hazardous contaminants removed from the feed material prior to shredding and as a result the company believes the shredder fluff generated is properly not considered a hazardous waste 
should the laws  regulations or testing methods change with regard to shredder fluff disposal  the company and its emco subsidiary may incur additional significant expenditures 
potential superfund liability the company s reserve subsidiary has received a notice from the united states environmental protection agency the epa that reserve and numerous other parties are considered potentially responsible parties a prp and may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of superfund or cercla to pay a portion of the cost of remedial investigation  feasibility studies and ultimately remediation to correct alleged releases of hazardous substances at the standard scrap metal chicago international exporting removal action site 
superfund may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that arranged for disposal of certain wastes  the waste transporters that selected the disposal sites  and the owners and operators of such sites 
responsible parties or any one of them may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault  legality of the original disposal  or ownership of the disposal site 
based upon its analysis of the situation  the management of reserve currently does not expect such potential liability to be in excess of  unregistered storage tanks underground storage tanks ust s exist at several of the company s subsidiaries sites 
ust s are subject to various federal  state and local laws on their operation 
in the event a release of regulated product has occurred  the company may incur significant costs to investigate and remediate the release 
environmental consultants to the company have reported that an underground storage tank ust located at one of the company s emco subsidiary s yards had not been reported to the arizona environmental authorities as required by law 
emco  as the lessee  reported the matter to the owner of the property  and believes that such report is the extent of its obligations with respect to this matter 
however  there can be no assurance that any failure of the owner to report will not result in liability or the assessment of penalties against the company or emco 
environmental consultants to the company have also reported that an above ground storage tank at the company s houtex subsidiary is required to be registered but is not yet registered 
employee health and safety issues the company and its subsidiaries are regulated by federal  state and local agencies responsible for employee health and safety  including osha 
a total of two accidental deaths of  and one serious accidental injury to  employees have occurred at the company s houtex and reserve subsidiaries during the past three years 
reserve has been fined by osha in regard to such incidents 
houtex has also been cited and fined by osha for alleged failure to establish energy control procedures and employee training in regard to mobile shearing equipment 
no assurance can be given that potential liabilities of the company or its subsidiaries in regard to such death and injuries  or in regard to any future deaths of or injuries to employees of the company s subsidiaries  will not be material 
recommendations of environmental consultants environmental consultants to the company have recommended that a variety of remedial actions be undertaken in regard to its subsidiaries  including the sampling of soil  surface and ground water at its various facilities  the remediation of any existing contamination under applicable regulations  the development of spill prevention control and countermeasure plans spcc  the completion of certain actions in regard to storm water pollution prevention plans  the timely completion and or filing of certain annual reports and summaries required by governmental agencies  the completion of oil discharge and response plans  and the remediation of certain materials suspected of containing asbestos 
if these recommendations were to be not followed by the company and its subsidiaries for an indefinite period of time  one or more of the sites might  potentially  be subject to a governmental enforcement action  the imposition of fines  penalties and damages  and or require remediation at some future time at a cost which the company cannot guarantee would not be material 
compliance history the company s subsidiaries have  in the past  been found not to be in compliance with certain environmental laws and regulations  and have incurred fines associated with such violations which have not been material in amount 
the company s subsidiaries have also paid a portion of the costs of certain remediation actions at certain sites 
no assurance can be given that additional compliance issues and liabilities will not occur in the future  or that the fines  penalties  damages and expenses might not be material 
effect of antitakeover provisions of delaware law  the company s charter documents and employment agreements the company is a corporation governed by the laws of the state of delaware 
certain provisions of delaware law and the charter documents of the company may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing changes in control or management of the company 
specifically  the company s board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval on such terms as the board may determine 
the rights of the holders of common stock of the company are subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the company is subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which has the effect of making changes in control of a company more difficult 
the company entered into employment agreements with gerard m 
jacobs  t 
benjamin jennings and george o 
moorehead 
such agreements provide for certain payments to be made to such persons in the event of a change of control of the company 
the effects of the antitakeover protections of delaware corporate law  the company charter documents and these employment agreements could be to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding stock of company 
the cozzi merger  if consummated  contemplates a shareholder agreement among messrs 
jacobs  jennings and the cozzi shareholders which could discourage a third party from acquiring a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company 
upon closing of the cozzi merger  the company expects to enter into employment agreements with albert  frank and greg cozzi as well as new employment agreements with gerard m 
jacobs and t 
benjamin jennings 
prior to the closing  the cozzi merger agreement forbids the company from initiating discussions or negotiations with third parties or responding to solicitations by third persons relating to any merger  sale or other disposition of any substantial part of the company s assets  without an approval from cozzi 
recent accounting standards the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled earnings per share sfas no 
 in february the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for its year ended march  initial adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements
