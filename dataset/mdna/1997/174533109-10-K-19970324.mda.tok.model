the increase in policy acquisition expenses of million  or  to million in  primarily reflects the growth in net premiums earned 
the decrease in other underwriting expenses reflects the unusually high level of expenses incurred during resulting from the expansion into ohio  including the cost of preparing to write multi state and cross state commercial line policies  as well as a reduction in in administration expenses resulting from process improvements in the commercial segment

financial condition reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses the company maintains reserves to provide for its estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates involving actuarial projections at a given point in time  of what management expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known  predictions of future events  estimates of future trends in claims severity and judicial theories of liability and other factors 
the inherent uncertainty of estimating insurance reserves is greater for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation  where a longer period may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability may be made  and liability lines  where the technological  judicial  and political climates involving these types of claims are changing 
the company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior reserve estimates are reflected in results of operations in the year such changes are determined to be needed and recorded 
the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve for unpaid losses and lae for the years ended december in millions reserve for losses and lae  beginning of year    incurred losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverable provision for insured events of current year decrease in provision for insured events of prior years total incurred losses and lae payments  net of reinsurance recoverable losses and lae attributable to insured events of current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years total payments change in reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses reserve for losses and lae  end of year    as part of an ongoing process  the reserves  net of reinsurance  have been re estimated for all prior accident years and were decreased by million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in favorable development of million in reflects improved severity in the personal automobile line  where favorable development increased million to million in  partially offset by less favorable development in the workers compensation line 
in  the workers compensation line had favorable development of million  primarily as a result of the company re estimating reserves to reflect the company s new claims cost management programs and the michigan supreme court ruling  which decreases the maximum to be paid for indemnity cases on all existing and future claims 
in  the favorable development in the workers compensation line of million also reflected these developments 
the increase in favorable development of million in from reflects improved severity in the personal automobile and workers compensation lines 
favorable development in the personal automobile line increased million from unfavorable development of million in to favorable development of million in favorable development in the workers compensation line increased million from million in to million in  due to the aforementioned change in claims cost management and the michigan supreme court ruling 
this favorable development reflects the company s reserving philosophy consistently applied over these periods 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the loss and lae reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
due to the nature of business written by the company  the exposure to environmental liabilities is relatively small 
losses and lae reserves related to environmental damage and toxic tort liability  included in the total reserve for losses and lae were million and million at the end of and  respectively  both net of reinsurance of million 
the company does not specifically underwrite policies that include this coverage  but as case law expands policy provisions and insurers liability beyond the intended coverage  the company has been required to defend such claims 
due to their unusual nature and absence of historical claims data  reserves for these claims are not determined using historical experience to project future losses 
although these claims are not material  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and is discussed because of the possibility  however remote  that they may become material 
the environmental liability could be revised in the near term if the estimates used in determining the liability are revised 
management believes that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate and the company is not aware of any litigation or pending claims that may result in additional material liabilities in excess of recorded reserves 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation on the company varies by product 
property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae  and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing rates  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs 
the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years 
however  inflation could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
the company regularly reviews its reserving techniques  its overall reserve position and its reinsurance 
based on i review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages  changes in political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii review of per claim information  iii historical loss experience of the company and the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies  and v internal estimates of required reserves  management believes that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on the results of operations 
reinsurance the company maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and lae activity 
this includes both excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect the ceding insurer from significant aggregate losses arising from a single event such as windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
the company determines the appropriate amount of reinsurance based on the company s evaluation of the risks accepted and analysis prepared by consultants and reinsurers and on market conditions including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
the company has reinsurance for casualty business 
under the casualty program  the reinsurers are responsible for of the amount of each loss in excess of million per occurrence up to million for general liability and workers compensation 
additionally  this reinsurance covers workers compensation losses in excess of million to million per occurrence 
under the company s catastrophe reinsurance program  citizens retains of losses in excess of million  up to million 
for losses in excess of million and up to million  the company retains of the loss 
amounts in excess of million are retained by the company 
in  citizens purchased aggregate catastrophe coverage which reinsures of million for aggregated catastrophe losses in excess of million which individually exceed million 
under this aggregate catastrophe coverage  citizens is expected to recover million 
in the years ended december   and  the company did not exceed the minimum catastrophe levels  either individually or in the aggregate  to obtain recovery under its reinsurance agreements  except as described above 
effective january   the company modified its reinsurance program 
the modifications include the purchase of additional casualty reinsurance and higher retention under the company s catastrophe reinsurance program 
under the casualty reinsurance program  the company added a layer which reinsured of each loss in excess of 
million up to million per occurrence 
under the catastrophe reinsurance program 
citizens retains the first million of loss per occurrence  of losses in excess of million  up to million  of all aggregate loss amounts in excess of million up to million  and of all aggregate loss amounts in excess of million up to million 
amounts in excess of million are retained by the company 
the company cedes to reinsurers a portion of its risk and pays a fee based upon premiums received on all policies subject to such reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the company from its obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company 
the company determines the appropriate amount of reinsurance based on evaluation of the risks accepted  analyses prepared by consultants and reinsurers  and on market conditions including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
the company also believes that the terms of its reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on its review of its reinsurers financial statements and reputations in the reinsurance marketplace  the company believes that its reinsurers are financially sound 
as a condition to the ability to conduct personal automobile business in the state of michigan  the company is required under michigan law to participate in a pooling arrangement with the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca 
the company is indemnified by the mcca for personal protection insurance losses in excess of million 
at december  the mcca was the only reinsurer which represented or more of the company s reinsurance business 
the company cedes a significant portion of its private passenger automobile premiums to the mcca 
ceded premiums earned to mcca in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
losses and lae ceded to mcca in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in  the mcca s favorable development on prior year reserves exceeded the losses and lae incurred during the current year 
the aggregate losses and lae ceded to the mcca have no impact on the company s consolidated statements of income 
at december  and  the company had reinsurance recoverable from the mcca on paid and unpaid losses of million and million  respectively 
because mcca is supported by assessments permitted by statute and all amounts billed by the company to mcca have been paid when due  the company believes that it has no significant exposure to uncollectible reinsurance balances 
the reserve for losses and lae at december  and  is shown gross of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses of million and million  respectively 
losses and lae ceded were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
ceded premiums earned were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
investment portfolio the company s investment policy is structured with emphasis on maximizing after tax income while providing liquidity and preserving asset quality 
the portfolio is dominated by fixed income securities 
the fixed income portfolio maintains a laddered maturity structure with a duration of years 
the company continually evaluates credit quality throughout the investment holding period 
the company s investment portfolio increased million to  million at december   from  million at december   primarily attributable to the investment of cash provided by operations of million 
approximately of the portfolio was invested in debt securities at december   compared to at december  at december    million  or  of debt securities held by the company were rated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic as investment grade or by the naic 
the remaining million were rated non investment grade 
at december    million  or  of the debt securities were rated investment grade 
at december   of debt securities were tax exempt investments  compared to at december  the company may make modest extensions in portfolio incremental credit risk and adjustments to its taxable and tax exempt positions in the future to seek to maximize after tax income 
at december   million  or  of the investment portfolio was invested in equity securities compared to million  or  at december  dividend income from equity securities was million  or  of investment income in  compared to million  or  in liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  citizens primary source of cash for payment of dividends to its shareholders is dividends from its insurance subsidiaries  which are subject to limitations imposed by state regulators 
such limitations require that dividends be paid only out of statutory earned surplus unassigned funds and impose a restriction on the payment of extraordinary dividends without prior approval of the state authorities 
the maximum dividend that may be paid to citizens corporation at january   without prior approval from the michigan commissioner of insurance  is million 
sources of cash for the company s insurance subsidiaries are from premiums collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid losses and lae  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to claim losses and lae can be variable because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
accordingly  the company s strategy is to monitor available cash and short term investment balances in relation to projected cash needs by matching maturities of its investments with expected payments of current and longer term liabilities 
the company periodically adjusts its investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities for the company was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in from is attributable primarily to the increase in payments for losses and lae of million to million in compared to million in the cash provided by operations in reflects more normal underwriting results and an increase over due to the high level of weather related claims during net cash used for investing activities for the company was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used for investing activities has declined in from primarily due to the decrease in cash flow from operations 
net cash used for investing activities increased in from primarily due to a reduction in the company s cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
net cash used in reflects the purchase of million of treasury stock and dividends paid to shareholders of million 
the relatively higher level of net cash used in reflects the redemption of million shares of series a preferred stock from the hanover insurance company for million 
shareholders equity was million  or per share  at december   compared to million  or per share  at december  shareholders equity reflects net income for the year  the repurchase of treasury stock and the impact of a net increase of million in the fair values of available for sale debt and equity securities 
changes in shareholders equity related to changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio will continue to be volatile as market prices of debt and equity securities fluctuate with changes in interest rates and economic conditions 
the company expects to continue to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
however  payment of future dividends is subject to the board of directors approval and dependent upon earnings and the financial condition of the company
