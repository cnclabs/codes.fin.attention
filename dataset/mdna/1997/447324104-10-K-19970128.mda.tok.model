the decrease in cnc systems and software sales was primarily the result of decreased shipments of autobend products to original equipment manufacturers  some of whom have developed their own cnc systems 
revenues attributable to sales of parts and service fees increased million  or  from fiscal levels  primarily as a result of increased part sales to support the increase in the installed machine base 
in the united states  sales and service fees in fiscal increased 
million  or  over fiscal reflecting a slight increase in shipments of machine tool products 
increased shipments of delta series control systems for metal cutting machine tools  primarily to original equipment manufacturers  were offset by decreased shipments of autobend control products to the metal fabrication equipment market 
european sales and service fees in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  inclusive of the effects of currency translation for financial reporting purposes 
european sales measured in local currency increased

the decline in domestic bookings was due almost entirely to the fact that domestic machine tool bookings during the first half of fiscal reflected unusually high demand for the just introduced advantage series machine tool line fueled  in part  by distributor anticipation of limited product availability 
the increasing availability of advantage series products for shipment in the second half of fiscal and first half of fiscal enabled the company to assure its domestic customers shorter delivery times  which  along with somewhat slower machine tool demand  contributed to a decline in the order rates 
domestic order bookings in the second half of fiscal approximated that of the comparable period in fiscal due in part to the introduction of new machine tool products in september consolidated backlog at october  was million compared to million at october   reflecting increased availability of products for shipment 
gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations for financial reporting purposes

on a worldwide basis  sales of cnc operated machine tools totaled million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal  and sales of cnc systems and software totaled million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal while the increases in both product lines reflected improvements in the world s principal machine tool markets  particularly germany  the significantly greater percentage increase associated with the sales of cnc operated machine tools was attributable to the strong demand for the company s new advantage series of machine tools as well as the enhanced availability of products for shipment as a result of capacity increases on the part of contract manufacturers 
revenues attributable to sales of parts and service fees declined million  or  from fiscal levels  primarily as a result of reduced sales of parts for discontinued machine tool models 
in the united states  sales and service fees in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  reflecting increases of million  or  in sales of cnc operated machine tools and million  or  in sales of cnc systems and software  offset by a decrease of million  or  in revenue from service parts and fees 
the improved sales were primarily attributable to increases in unit volume  rather than pricing  due to enhanced demand for and availability of the company s advantage product line and general strengthening of the markets for both fully integrated machine tools and cnc systems 
in europe  sales and service fees in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  inclusive of the effects of currency conversion for financial reporting purposes 
net of currency translation effects  the improvement was primarily attributable to a increase in unit volume and a increase in average unit prices realized for the company s cnc operated machine tools  reflecting the introduction of the new advantage series in the second half of fiscal as well as a significant strengthening of the european machine tool markets 
in asia  sales and service fees increased to million in fiscal from  recorded for fiscal  reflecting the company s more competitive pricing of the new advantage series product line in that market 
on a combined basis  european and asian sales and service fees in fiscal  exclusive of currency translation effects  accounted for of total worldwide revenues  compared with in fiscal  due primarily to the more significant year to year change in general market conditions in europe than in the united states  as well as improvements in the company s foreign sales and marketing operations

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal increased  or  over fiscal primarily because of foreign currency translation effects of  and increased selling expenses associated with increased unit volume 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales and service fees  was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company generated million of operating income in fiscal compared to a million operating loss in fiscal  a million improvement 
this return to operating profitability after three years of losses reflects the benefits of the company s restructuring program  the phase in of new higher margin products and improved market conditions worldwide

no income tax expense has been provided for fiscal the income tax liability incurred in certain tax jurisdictions was offset by the reversal of valuation allowance reserves against the company s net operating loss carryforwards
