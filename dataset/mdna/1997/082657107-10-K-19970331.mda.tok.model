the registrant also acquired of the shares of laboratorios belmac in february  as well as amodex r trademark and licensing rights in france in december item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the registrant is an international pharmaceutical and health care company with its primary focus on the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical and health care products 
substantially all of its revenues have come from its operations in france and spain  however  the registrant markets disposable linens to emergency healthcare services in the united states 
the registrant incurred a net loss before extra ordinary item of  and a net loss of  for the year ended december  the registrant intends to continue to focus its efforts on business activities which management believes should result in operating profits in the future  of which there can be no assurance 
to improve its results  the registrant s management will focus on increasing higher margin pharmaceutical and health care product sales  controlling expenses through its austerity program  careful prioritization of research and development projects resulting in continued low overall research and development expenditures  and potentially acquiring marketable products or profitable companies in the united states or europe that are compatible with the registrant s strategy for growth 
see liquidity and capital resources 
currently  the profit margins for the products sold by the registrant s subsidiary in spain are significantly higher than those generated by the registrant s subsidiary in france 
the company is currently engaged in negotiations with a subsidiary of a large european conglomerate to sell its french subsidiary  chimos 
the transaction is expected to be finalized early in the second quarter of as no definitive agreement has been signed  there can be no assurance that such sale will be consumated

per common share for the year ended december  compared to revenues of  and a net loss of  or 
per common share for the prior year 
sales and cost of sales 
the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales by the registrant s french subsidiary  chimos  to  which was partially offset by a increase in sales by the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac  to  for the year ended december  as previously reported  revenues declined beginning in the second quarter of  due to the march  expiration of its distribution agreement for the product ceredase  which accounted for approximately of the registrant s revenues in the year ended december  ceredase gross margins  as a percent of sales  were approximately  therefore  the impact on operating profits is not considered to be material 
gross margins for the year ended december  improved to when compared to gross margins of in the prior year  primarily as a result of the more rapid rate of growth in sales at laboratorios belmac  whose sales generate significantly higher gross margins than those of chimos  as well as the loss of low margin ceredase sales 
the registrant s distribution operations in france  chimos  generate relatively low gross margins approximately for the year ended december  as opposed to the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac  which is experiencing substantially higher margins approximately for the year ended december  operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased and the composition changed as a result of increased selling expenses incurred by the spanish subsidiary  which are necessary in order to sustain the increase in sales volume that the spanish sales force has generated in the year ended december  this increase was offset in part by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses by chimos  primarily due to the loss of ceredase sales  during the year ended december  the registrant intends to continue its efforts to control general and administrative expenses as part of its austerity program in its effort to reach and maintain profitability 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the registrant s management has shifted the focus from research and development to a more cost effective strategy of acquiring late stage development compounds that can be marketed within one year as well as currently marketed products 
as a result of this shift in operations  the registrant has decreased its research and development spending over the past few years 
research and development activities have been performed  under contract  by various universities and consulting research laboratories 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year  primarily due to the disposal of certain fixed assets during the quarters ended june and september  as a result of the registrant s move to smaller  more cost effective office space 
as a result of estimating the proceeds from the proposed sale of chimos  the registrant reviewed  for impairment  the recoverable value of the carrying amount of long lived assets and intangibles 
based upon this review  the registrant charged to operations  a provision for goodwill impairment  representing the remaining unamortized chimos goodwill of approximately  at december  other income expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the  increase reflects interest expense arising primarily from i the notes sold by the registrant in its october private placements  which notes were paid with the proceeds of the public offering completed in february and ii the debentures sold in the february public offering 
the registrant incurred an extra ordinary charge of  representing the unamoritized discount and issuance costs at the date of repayment of the notes from its october private placements 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was with respect to interest earned on the proceeds of the public offering and cash collected from ceredase receivables which have been temporarily invested in short term interest bearing investments included in cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet 
other income expense  net of  for the year ended december   is substantially lower than other income expense  net of  for the prior year  which is primarily comprised of  related to settlement of litigation  a  gain recognized upon the sale of the registrant s belmacina trademark in spain and the effect of a reversal of an over accrual of a liability related to the proposed sale of biolid r  which did not occur  in the amount of  offset by a charge of  for cancellation of the stock subscription receivable and related interest from a former officer of the registrant 
although the registrant reported a decrease in sales  the improved gross margins of and controlled spending with respect to operating expenses in the year ended december   resulted in a  improvement in its loss from operations from  in the prior year to  for the year ended december  the loss from operations includes a charge of  for a provision for goodwill impairment related to the proposed chimos disposition 
this improvement was offset by interest expense associated with i the notes sold by the registrant in its october private placements  and ii the debentures sold in the february public offering  resulting in a net loss of  or 
per common share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or 
per common share for the prior year 
fiscal year ended december  versus fiscal year ended december  the registrant reported revenues of  and a net loss of  or 
per common share for the year ended december  compared to revenues of  and a net loss of  or per common share for the prior year 
sales and cost of sales 
the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in sales by the registrant s subsidiary in france  chimos  which distributes specialty pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals in france 
consolidated gross margins for the year ended december  remained consistent at when compared to the prior year  including the effect of a  charge to cost of sales in the year ended december   representing an increase in the registrant s reserves for slow moving or obsolete inventory in europe 
the registrant s distribution operations in france chimos whose sales accounted for approximately of revenues generate relatively low gross margins as opposed to the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac whose sales accounted for approximately of revenues  and is experiencing substantially higher margins 
the registrant expects sales in to decline as a result of the march  expiration of its distribution agreement for the product  ceredase  which accounted for approximately of its revenues in ceredase gross margins  as a percent of sales  have been minimal  therefore  the impact on operating profits is not expected to be material 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  for the year ended december  compared to  or of sales  for the prior year 
the decrease from to of sales is primarily attributable to cost control measures implemented by the registrant 
the registrant intends to continue its efforts to control general and administrative expenses as part of its austerity program in its effort to reach and maintain profitability 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the decrease reflects the results of a thorough review of all research and development activities and the establishment of priorities based upon both technical and commercial criteria 
during this period  the registrant did not commence any new research and development programs 
the registrant intends to continue to carefully manage its research and development expenditures in the future in view of its limited resources 
depreciation and amortization expenses remained relatively unchanged at  for the year ended december  compared to  in the prior year 
other income expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the increase reflects approximately  of fourth quarter interest arising primarily from the notes sold by the registrant in its october private placements and  to a lesser degree  interest on higher average outstanding balances on short term borrowings  which are used to finance working capital needs 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the  decrease reflects the registrant s use of its resources for working capital needs  resulting in reduced earnings on liquid assets 
interest expense and interest income will both be higher in than in as a result of the registrant s february public offering of units as hereinafter defined see liquidity and capital resources financings 
other income expense  net  of  for the year ended december  is primarily comprised of income of  related to a settlement of litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the  gain recognized upon the sale of the registrant s belmacina trademark in spain  which was previously reflected in the registrant s consolidated financial statements as deferred revenue as of december  the registrant has since transferred the trademark to the purchaser and collected the balance of the related receivable in the fourth quarter of other income expense  net  also includes the effect of a reversal of an over accrual of a liability related to the proposed sale of biolid  which did not occur  in the amount of  offset by a charge of  for cancellation of the stock subscription receivable and related interest from a former officer of the registrant 
one half of the loss approximately  incurred by maximed pharmaceuticals  the registrant s partnership with maximed corporation  is also included in other income expense  net  in the year ended december  although the registrant is in a dispute with its partner  and has ceased funding the partnership s activities until such dispute is resolved  appropriate operating costs have been accrued and charged to operations during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources total assets increased from  at december  to  at december   while common stockholders equity decreased from  at december  to  at december  the decrease in common stockholders equity reflects primarily the february public offering of units  offset by a fluctuation in the exchange rates of european currencies compared to the us dollar and the loss incurred by the registrant for the year ended december  the registrant s working capital increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the february public offering of units 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the completion of a public offering of its securities in february and collection of receivables for sales of ceredase 
receivables decreased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as the result of the decline in sales by its french subsidiary  chimos  as a result of the expiration of the ceredase distribution agreement as of march  the registrant reduced its receivables by  since that date primarily by collecting receivables for sales of ceredase  which were utilized to reduce accounts payable balances by  and to reduce the amount of short term borrowings by  during the nine months ended december  a significant portion of the registrant s trade receivables arise from sales of pharmaceutical and health care products to the french government 
payment terms for such sales are typically to days  the registrant has not experienced any material delinquent accounts 
inventories also decreased to  at december  compared to  at december   primarily due to the decline in sales by the french subsidiary and the corresponding reduction in inventory levels 
although the combined total of accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased from  at december  to  at december  and short term borrowings decreased slightly from  at december  to  at december   as discussed above  such balances are significantly reduced below their march  balances  as a result of application of cash collected from receivables during the nine months ended december  fixed assets  net decreased from  at december  to  at december   partly due to a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and partly due to the disposal of certain unnecessary fixed assets and write off of leasehold improvements by the registrant associated with its relocation to smaller  more cost effective  office space in april partially offset by improvements to fixed assets in spain 
other non current assets increased from  at december  to  at december  and long term debt increased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as a result of the public offering of units in february the increase in other non current assets was partially offset by the provision for goodwill impairment of  investing activities  including the purchase of investments available for sale of  and the addition of fixed assets  used net cash of  during the year ended december  financing activities primarily the sale of units in a public offering in february provided net proceeds of  after repayment of  of long term debt  for the year ended december  operating activities for the year ended december  used net cash of  the loss on the disposal of fixed assets and write off of leasehold improvements associated with the registrant s relocation to smaller  more cost effective office space in april was  seasonality 
in the past  the registrant has experienced lower sales in certain calendar quarters of each year 
should the registrant begin large sales of a pharmaceutical product whose sales are seasonal  seasonality of sales may become more significant 
currency 
a substantial amount of the registrant s business is conducted in spain and france and is therefore influenced by the extent to which there are fluctuations in the dollar s value against such countries currencies 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on long lived assets for the year ended december  was a decrease of  and the cumulative historical effect was a decrease of  as reflected in the registrant s consolidated balance sheets in the liabilities and stockholders equity section 
although exchange rates fluctuated significantly in recent years  the registrant does not believe that the effect of foreign currency fluctuation is material to the registrant s results of operations as the expenses related to much of the registrant s foreign currency revenues are in the same currency as such revenues 
the registrant relies primarily upon financing activities to fund the operations of the registrant in the united states and has not transferred significant amounts into or out of the united states in the recent past 
in the event that the registrant is required to fund united states operations with funds generated in spain or france  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on the registrant 
however  at the present time  the registrant does not anticipate altering its business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations 
financings 
to finance its operations  in october the registrant conducted two private placements of its securities 
in the first placement  the registrant sold to certain purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of   shares of the registrant s common stock and promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of  which became payable in full upon the earlier of july  or the closing of a public offering of the registrant s securities 
in the second placement  the registrant sold to certain purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of   shares of common stock and promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of  which became payable in full upon the earlier of september  or the completion of a public offering 
a public offering was completed in february and all of such notes were repaid at that time or converted into units 
an aggregate of  units the units were sold in the february public offering 
each unit consisted of a one thousand dollars  principal amount convertible senior subordinated debenture due february  the debentures and  class a redeemable warrants  each to purchase one share of common stock and one class b redeemable warrant 
two class b redeemable warrants entitle a holder to purchase one share of common stock 
the debentures and class a redeemable warrants initially traded only as a unit but began trading separately on may  interest on the debentures is payable quarterly 
the debentures are convertible prior to maturity  unless previously redeemed  at any time commencing february  the anniversary date into shares of common stock at a conversion price per share of 
gross and net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and the other expenses of the offering were approximately  and  respectively  a portion of which were used to retire  principal balance of debt incurred in the private placements discussed above 
of the unit purchase price of  for financial reporting purposes  the consideration allocated to the debenture was  to the conversion discount feature of the debenture was and to the  class a warrants was none of the unit purchase price was allocated to the class b warrants 
such allocation was based upon the relative fair values of each security on the date of issuance 
such allocation resulted in recording a discount on the debentures of approximately  the effective interest rate on the debentures is management expects that as a result of completing its recent financings  by carefully prioritizing research and development activities and continuing its austerity program  the registrant should have sufficient liquidity to fund operations into the registrant  however  continues to explore alternative sources for financing its business 
in appropriate situations  that will be strategically determined  the registrant may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contribution by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of products under development and the sale of certain of the assets of  or one or more of  its subsidiaries 
the company is currently engaged in negotiations with a subsidiary of a large european conglomerate to sell its french subsidiary  chimos 
the transaction is expected to be finalized early in the second quarter of as no definitive agreement has been signed  there can be no assurance that such sale will be consumated 
sales generated by chimos began to decline in the second quarter of due to the expiration of a distribution agreement for the product ceredase 
since the expiration of this distribution agreement  chimos has been generating revenues at the rate of approximately million per annum
