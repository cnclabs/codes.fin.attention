item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all statements contained herein that are not historical facts  including but not limited to  statements regarding the company s plans for future development and operation of its business  are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking in nature and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following a lack of sufficient capital to finance the company s business plan on terms satisfactory to the company  pricing pressures which could affect demand for the company s wireless communications services  changes in labor  equipment and capital costs  the unavailability of digital compression technology and equipment at reasonable prices  the company s inability to incorporate digital compression technology into certain of its subscription television systems in a cost efficient manner  the company s inability to develop and implement new services such as high speed internet access and telephony  the company s inability to obtain the necessary authorizations from the fcc for such new services  competitive factors  such as the introduction of new technologies and competitors into the wireless communications business  a failure by the company to attract strategic partners  general business and economic conditions  and the other risk factors described from time to time in the company s reports filed with the sec 
the company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which statements are made pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act of  and as such  speak only as of the date made 
introduction during  the company s business strategy evolved to adapt to the significant regulatory and technological changes that have occurred recently in the telecommunications industry and to the company s capital constraints 
see business regulation and business competition 
management now believes that the most promising use of the company s wireless assets may be to provide a variety of digital wireless services  instead of the traditional analog based technology utilized by the company to date 
such digital wireless services could include digital video ie  subscription television  high speed internet access and telephony services 
a successful deployment of such services might include the full bundle of broad band ie  video and high speed internet and narrow band ie  telephony services 
while the company has begun planning and testing of these wireless services  it has not yet introduced any of these services 
as more fully described above under business certain requirements and uncertainties  the company s ability to introduce these services will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of sufficient capital  competitive factors such as the introduction of new technologies or the entry of competitors with significantly greater resources than the company  the level of consumer demand for such services  and the company s ability to obtain the necessary regulatory changes and approvals 
during  the company intends to continue to operate its developed markets principally as an analog wireless cable business 
however  because of its current financial condition and its revised business strategy  the company does not plan to make the capital expenditures necessary to add enough new subscribers to replace those subscribers that choose to stop receiving the company s service 
moreover  at this time  the company does not generally intend to further develop any of its undeveloped markets using analog technology 
thus  the company anticipates that its analog customer base will decrease somewhat during as the company s analog subscriber base decreases  its revenues are expected to decrease unless and until it is able to successfully introduce other revenue producing wireless services  such as digital video  high speed internet access and telephony 
since early  the company has taken certain actions aimed at reducing its costs and conserving its capital  including reductions in the size of the company s workforce and decreases in capital expenditures and discretionary expenses 
as a result  the company currently expects that its existing cash and investment balances  proceeds from the credit facility as defined herein  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance its operations during thereafter  additional financing will be required 
if the company s capital resources are not sufficient to finance its operations  either in or thereafter  the company will be required to curtail its operations and development plans  which curtailment could involve  among other things  a complete cessation of new customer additions 
in march  the company entered into an agreement to sell certain assets to bellsouth wireless with anticipated proceeds to the company ranging from million to million  depending on the number of wireless cable channel rights that are ultimately transferred to bellsouth wireless 
see business recent development 
any such proceeds will provide further resources to help finance the company s operations and development plans 
in addition  the company is pursuing strategic relationships or transactions with other providers of telecommunications services 
one of the company s primary objectives in pursuing such relationships and transactions is to facilitate access to additional capital 
see liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds strategic relationship objectives 
the company s developed markets generate negative operating cash flow until the subscriber base becomes sufficiently large for incremental revenues  net of incremental costs  to offset fixed costs  other than depreciation and other non cash expenses 
certain costs  such as programming costs  generally increase in proportion to the number of subscribers  while other costs  such as tower rental and related maintenance costs  remain constant or increase at proportionately lower levels 
accordingly  systems with larger subscriber bases generally produce higher operating margins  and systems with small subscriber bases usually produce negative operating margins 
for the year ended december   of the company s developed markets generated positive operating cash flow 
operating cash flow is a commonly used measure of performance in the wireless cable industry 
however  operating cash flow does not purport to represent cash used by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company leases many of the channels used to transmit its programming from fcc license holders 
typically  these leases provide for payments based upon the number of subscribers  subject in many cases to certain minimums  as more fully discussed in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
total channel lease payments approximated of total revenues during the year ended december  total programming expenses approximated of total revenues during the same period 
such expenses vary from system to system depending upon the number of channels offered and pay channel penetration 
marketing costs are expensed in the period incurred 
as a result  operating results in any period are negatively affected by expenditures for marketing and promotion 
since the company s monthly services are billed in advance  accounts receivable are relatively small 
the company capitalizes all installation costs labor  subcontractor costs and supplies 
such capitalized installation costs generally are amortized over three years 
headend equipment is generally depreciated over ten years 
equipment purchased and awaiting installation into subscriber premises is classified as part of property and equipment in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management believes that period to period comparisons of the company s financial results to date are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance due to the company s historically high growth rate and the number of system launches and acquisitions during the periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds the company has experienced negative cash flows from operations in each year since its formation  and although certain of the company s more established systems currently generate positive cash flow from operations  the company expects to continue to experience negative consolidated free cash flow from operations 
until sufficient cash flow is generated from operations  the company will be required to utilize its current capital resources or external sources of funding to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure needs 
the company expects that its principal capital expenditure requirements for will relate to replacement of customer churn  launch of high speed internet services in one or more markets and the purchase of transmission equipment for new channels 
the company intends to finance these capital expenditures from existing cash and investment balances  borrowings under the credit facility  and cash generated from system operations 
the commercial introduction by the company of digital services  such as digital video  high speed internet access and telephony  would require substantial additional capital expenditures 
while the company may use a portion of the proceeds from the bellsouth transaction to acquire assets for the development of such digital services  management does not expect that such proceeds will be sufficient to fully implement its digital strategies for video  internet access and telephony throughout its markets 
as further described below  the company is pursuing relationships or transactions with other providers of telecommunications services to facilitate access to additional capital  among other things 
see strategic relationship objectives 
the company s ability to fully implement its revised business strategy will depend on its ability to attract sufficient additional capital through relationships with strategic partners or otherwise 
there can be no assurance that sufficient capital will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  or at all 
on march   the company entered into the bellsouth agreement  which provides for the sale of all of the company s southeastern assets to bellsouth wireless 
the southeastern assets include operating wireless cable systems in orlando  lakeland  jacksonville  daytona beach and ft 
myers  florida and louisville  kentucky and wireless cable channel rights in bradenton  naples  sebring and miami  florida 
the purchase price for all of the southeastern assets will range from million to million  depending upon the number of wireless cable channel rights that are ultimately transferred to bellsouth wireless 
see business recent development 
the bellsouth agreement contains customary conditions to closing  including the expiration of applicable waiting periods under the federal antitrust laws and the satisfaction of all applicable regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that all of such conditions will be satisfied or that the bellsouth transaction will be consummated 
to date  the company s operations have required substantial amounts of capital for i the installation of equipment in new subscribers homes  ii the construction of additional transmission and headend facilities and related equipment purchases  iii the funding of start up losses and other working capital requirements  iv the acquisition of wireless cable channel rights and systems  and v investments in  and maintenance of  vehicles and administrative offices 
the company s capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions of wireless cable systems and additions to deferred license and leased license acquisition costs  during the years ended december   and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
such expenditures were primarily for the construction and expansion of the company s wireless cable systems and the installation of equipment in new subscribers homes 
in addition  the company was involved in the bidding process for wireless cable channel authorizations in certain basic trading areas btas  which was completed in march the company was the highest bidder in markets 
in the aggregate  the company s bids in these markets totaled approximately million 
of such amount  a total of approximately million has been paid 
the remaining amount approximately  is due upon the fcc s notification to the company of the issuance of the remainder of its bta licenses  which the company expects will occur in on june   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire wireless cable channel rights and certain other subscription television assets in cincinnati  ohio the cincinnati acquisition for aggregate consideration of approximately million of which approximately million had been paid as of january  
also on june   the company acquired certain of the cincinnati subscription television assets and entered into a management agreement to operate the subscription television assets that it has not yet acquired 
the subscription television assets acquired or to be acquired by the company in connection with the cincinnati acquisition served approximately  subscribers as of the date of acquisition 
completion of the cincinnati acquisition is subject to certain contingencies  such as fcc approvals  the satisfactory completion of due diligence  and other customary conditions to closing  which may or may not be satisfied 
there can be no assurance that the cincinnati acquisition will be consummated 
in february  million of notes issued in connection with the company s september acquisition of superchannels of las vegas  inc were converted into  shares of ati common stock 
in may  the company completed an offering of  shares of its class a common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in august  the company completed a private placement of  shares of its series b convertible preferred stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million 
in october  the company completed a private placement of  shares of its series b convertible preferred stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million 
during  the company also completed the sale of wireless cable systems in st 
james  minnesota and yankton  south dakota and wireless cable channel assets in sioux falls  south dakota for cash consideration totaling million of which approximately  is being held in escrow pending completion of certain post closing events 
under the terms of a supplemental indenture dated august   governing the company s senior discount notes due the notes  the yield to maturity of the notes was to be adjusted to per annum from per annum if the company did not  between august  and november   issue equity securities having a value at the time of issuance of at least million in the aggregate 
subsequent to august   the company issued equity securities which had an aggregate value at the time of issuance in excess of million 
these issuances satisfied the condition set forth in the supplemental indenture 
accordingly  the yield to maturity of the notes will remain at 
strategic relationship objectives as described above  the company will require significant additional capital to fully implement its revised business strategy including costs associated with the provision of digital video service in certain of its developed markets and the introduction of other digital wireless services such as high speed internet access and telephony 
to meet such capital requirements  the company is pursuing opportunities to enter into strategic relationships or transactions with other providers of telecommunications services 
such relationships or transactions could involve  among other things  joint ventures  sales or exchanges of stock or assets  or loans to or investments in the company by strategic partners 
as of the date of this report  other than the bellsouth transaction  the company has not reached any agreements or understandings with respect to such relationships or transactions and there can be no assurance that any such agreements or understandings will be reached 
credit facilities credit facility on february   the company entered into a million credit facility the credit facility with banque indosuez  new york branch the bank 
proceeds of the credit facility are to be used to repay a portion of the company s existing debt  for capital expenditures  to complete certain pending acquisitions of wireless cable channel rights  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the term of the credit facility is up to twelve months 
the loan must be repaid earlier than the specified termination date and certain mandatory prepayments must be made with proceeds from debt issuances or certain asset sales  including the bellsouth transaction 
the credit facility bears interest at a rate of  which rate shall increase by per quarter 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a security interest in favor of the bank in substantially all of the assets of ati and its subsidiaries 
the credit facility is further secured by a pledge of the stock of substantially all of ati s subsidiaries as well as a pledge of the note due to the company from its fresno subsidiary under the fresno facility as defined herein 
the company paid the bank a commitment fee of  at closing  the company paid an additional fee of  and reimbursed the bank for its out of pocket expenses incurred in conjunction with the making of the loan 
during the term of the credit facility  the company is required to pay to the bank a commitment commission on the unused loan balance at the annual rate of 
at closing  the company also delivered  bond appreciation rights bars and an option to exercise  debt warrants or  equity warrants 
the debt warrants give the holder the right to increase the principal amount of the loan by per warrant  or the right to require the company to purchase the debt warrant for per warrant 
the debt warrants are exercisable or puttable during a five day period beginning on the earlier of one year from the date of issuance  or notice that payment in full of the credit facility has occurred or will occur shortly 
the equity warrants give the holder the right to purchase up to  shares of the company s class a common stock for a price of per share 
pursuant to the option agreement relating to the warrants  the equity warrants become exercisable only to the extent that the holder elects not to exercise or put the debt warrants or  if the holder elects to put the debt warrants to the company  the company fails to make payment therefor within the time required 
amounts payable in connection with the bars are based upon the appreciation in price of million face value of the company s notes 
the bars are exercisable after the earlier of june  or the occurrence of an event of default under the notes 
the payment due upon exercise of each bar is equal to the market price of the notes on the closing date less the net value of the bars is payable to holders of the bars in cash 
the company has deposited million in escrow to satisfy certain interest obligations under the credit facility 
fresno facility during  the fresno partnership maintained a revolving credit facility the fresno facility with a bank that provided for borrowings for the fresno  visalia and merced systems 
however  no amounts were available for borrowing under such facility as of december  effective june   the fresno facility was amended the amended agreement to  among other things i permit the incurrence by the fresno partnership of up to million in subordinated debt due ati  ii permit the payment to ati by the fresno partnership of a loan fee of up to  and iii modify certain of the financial and other operating covenants specified in the original agreement 
in addition  past violations of certain financial and other operating covenants associated with the fresno facility were waived by the bank 
in exchange for the bank s entering into the amended agreement  the fresno partnership agreed to cause the bank s participation in the fresno facility to be eliminated by march   through prepayment by the fresno partnership of all amounts due  assignment of the bank s participation to a third party lender or lenders including ati  or some combination of the foregoing 
in connection therewith  as of december  ati had purchased  in the aggregate  a million participation in the fresno facility from the bank 
in february  ati purchased the remaining million participation in the fresno facility from the bank 
as a result  the fresno facility is now an obligation of the fresno partnership to ati 
the fresno facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants that  among other things  prohibit the payment of dividends 
as of december   the fresno partnership was not in compliance with certain of the restrictive covenants contained in the fresno facility 
outstanding borrowings under the fresno facility bear interest at the banks prime rate plus at december  
interest expense relating to the fresno facility during the year ended december  totaled  the fresno facility is secured by the assets of the fresno  visalia and merced systems 
other liquidity and capital resources requirements and limitations as a result of certain limitations contained in the indentures the indentures relating to the notes and the company s senior discount notes due the notes  the company s total borrowing capacity outside the notes and the notes is currently limited to million and its additional borrowing capacity is currently limited to approximately million 
the company expects that it will utilize the credit facility to borrow all amounts that it is permitted to borrow under the terms of the indentures 
thus  the company does not expect to be able to raise additional debt capital in the foreseeable future 
moreover  under current market conditions  the company does not expect to be able to raise additional capital by issuing equity securities 
in the future  the issuance of moderate amounts of certain types of new equity could  under section of the internal revenue code  require the company to pay income taxes on gains received on asset sales because of the company s inability to fully offset such gains against net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has taken certain actions aimed at reducing its costs and conserving its capital  including reductions in the size of its workforce and decreases in capital expenditures and discretionary expenses 
as a result of these actions  the company currently expects that its existing cash and investment balances  proceeds from the credit facility  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance its operations during thereafter  additional financing will be required 
if the company s capital resources are not sufficient to finance its operations  either in or thereafter  the company will be required to curtail its operations and development plans  which curtailment could involve  among other things  a complete cessation of new customer additions 
if the bellsouth transaction or any strategic relationships or transactions with other providers of telecommunications services are consummated  the proceeds therefrom will provide further resources to help finance the company s operations and development plans 
historically  the company has generated operating and net losses on a consolidated basis and can be expected to do so for the foreseeable future 
such losses may increase as the company s analog subscriber base declines  unless and until the company is able to successfully introduce other revenue producing wireless services 
as a result of its history of net losses  the company currently has a negative tangible net worth and expects that negative stockholders equity will result before march  a negative tangible net worth or stockholders equity position has significant implications  including  but not limited to  non compliance with nasdaq national market listing criteria 
if the company ceases to satisfy the nasdaq national market listing criteria  its class a common stock will be subject to delisting  unless an exception is granted by the national association of securities dealers 
if an exception is not granted  trading in the company s class a common stock would thereafter be conducted in the over the counter market 
consequently  it would be more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of the class a common stock 
delisting could result in a decline in the trading market for the class a common stock  which could potentially depress the company s stock and bond prices  among other things 
the company believes that the proceeds of the bellsouth transaction  if consummated  will help bring the company into compliance with the nasdaq national market listing criteria 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or sustain positive tangible net worth  stockholders equity or net income in the future 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year service revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million during the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the addition of new subscribers 
subscriber increases resulted primarily from the acquisition of subscription television subscribers in cincinnati  the acquisitions of the redding  las vegas and rapid city systems  and the completion of construction and commencement of operation of systems in yuba city and lincoln during and anchorage and portland during service price increases contributed only a small portion of the aggregate increase in service revenues 
the number of subscribers to the company s wireless cable systems increased to  at december   compared to  at december  on a same system basis comparing systems that were operational for all of each of the years ended december  and  service revenues increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  same systems during these periods totaled systems 
the average number of same system subscribers increased approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  installation revenues totaled million in each of the years ended december  and the number of installations completed during the year ended december  decreased approximately as compared to the year ended december  however  this decrease was fully offset by less discounting of installation rates 
installation rates vary widely by system based upon competitive conditions 
the company occasionally reduces installation charges as part of selected promotional campaigns 
operating expenses  principally programming  site costs and other direct expenses  aggregated million or of total revenues during the year ended december   compared to million or of total revenues during the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily the result of additional systems and subscribers  as well as increased programming costs for additions to channel line ups and increased pay per view offerings in various systems 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million or of total revenues during the year ended december   compared to million or of total revenues during the year ended december  the decrease in such expenses of million resulted from decreased marketing activity  net of marketing expenses associated with the addition of new systems 
during the year ended december   general and administrative expenses totaled million or of total revenues  a  decrease over the year ended december  million or of total revenues 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses principally resulted from reductions in the number of employees and certain non recurring expenses totaling million recognized during relating to the recognition of certain lease termination and severance costs 
such decreases were partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses associated with the addition of new systems 
in the fourth quarter of  after considering the company s operating loss  its history of such operating losses and the expectation of future operating losses  changes in the company s strategic direction  developments relating to previously scheduled industry transactions and ventures  and the industry factors described above under business regulation and business competition  the company evaluated the ongoing value of its wireless cable business in each developed market 
based on this valuation  the company determined that assets with a carrying value of million were impaired according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and wrote down the carrying value of such assets by million to their fair value 
an evaluation was made for each of the company s developed markets individually  not for the company s markets as a whole 
fair value was based on recent transactions in the wireless cable industry 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company prospectively revised the lives of its subscriber premise equipment from seven years to three or four years 
the company s loss from operations was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in the loss from operations of million during resulted primarily from the impairment loss of million described above and increased depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense principally depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of deferred license and leased license acquisition costs  goodwill and covenants not to compete increased million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due to increases in deferred license costs  goodwill and subscriber equipment resulting from the acquisition and addition of new systems and the addition of equipment installed in new subscribers homes 
interest expense increased million during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense primarily resulted from noncash interest charges associated with the company s notes and notes 
interest expense associated with the notes also increased due to an increase in the interest rate on the notes from to effected in august in conjunction with the company s offering of the notes 
loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and the impairment write down described above totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to a loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization of million during the year ended december  fiscal year compared to fiscal year service revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million during the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the addition of new subscribers 
subscriber increases resulted not only from the acquisitions of the bend  fen wen group  oklahoma city  wichita and lakeland systems  the acquisitions of the medford  sheridan  fresno  visalia  merced  redding  las vegas and rapid city systems  and the commencement of operations in columbus  youngstown  jacksonville  lansing and monterey during and ft 
collins  greeley  yuba city  and lincoln during  but also from increased marketing and promotional efforts in all markets 
service price increases contributed only a small portion of the aggregate increase in service revenues 
the number of subscribers to the company s wireless cable systems increased to approximately  at december  compared to approximately  at december  on a same system basis comparing systems that were operational for all of each of the years ended december  and  service revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the addition of new subscribers 
same systems during this period consisted of the company s colorado springs  orlando  ft 
myers  billings  toledo  daytona beach  michiana  denver  little rock and louisville systems 
the number of subscribers in these systems increased approximately during the year ended december  installation revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in installation revenues of  or  was primarily the net result of more subscriber installations in each system  less the effect of lower per subscriber installation charges in certain systems 
operating expenses aggregated million or of total revenues during the year ended december   as compared to million or of total revenues during the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily the result of additional systems and subscribers as well as increased programming costs from additions to channel line ups in various systems 
in  the company began capitalizing all subscriber installation costs 
previously  the company expensed an amount equal to installation revenues and capitalized installation costs in excess of installation revenues 
this change in accounting method was effected to better match installation costs with related subscriber service revenues 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include installation costs which were expensed of approximately  marketing and selling expenses totaled million or of total revenues during the year ended december   as compared to million or of total revenues during the year ended december  the increase in such expenses of million resulted primarily from the addition of new systems  intensified sales and marketing efforts including the introduction of the wantv sm brand name in certain of the company s systems  and from increased media spending 
during  general and administrative expenses totaled million or of total revenues  a million increase over the year ended december  of total revenues 
this increase resulted not only from the addition of new systems and increased corporate and regional overhead expenses  but also from the recognition of severance costs totaling  and lease termination costs of  related to the relocation of the company s corporate headquarters to larger office space in colorado springs 
the company s loss from operations was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in the loss from operations of million resulted from increased depreciation and amortization expense  as well as from the increases in marketing and general and administrative expenses described above 
depreciation and amortization expense principally depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of deferred license and leased license acquisition costs  goodwill and covenants not to compete increased million due to increases in deferred license costs  goodwill and subscriber equipment resulting from the acquisition and addition of new systems and the addition of equipment installed in new subscribers homes 
approximately  of the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was attributable to the change in accounting for installation costs previously described 
interest expense increased million during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense primarily resulted from noncash interest charges associated with the notes and notes and additional borrowings under  and higher interest rates associated with  the company s various revolving credit facilities 
the company s loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  a pro forma amount of million assuming the change in accounting method was applied retroactively 
the increase in the loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of million primarily resulted from proportionately larger start up losses of the company s systems that commenced operation during  pre opening costs and start up losses of the company s systems that commenced operations during  increased marketing expenses  and increased corporate overhead related to significant system development and market expansion activities 
such increases were partially offset by improved operating results from growth in the company s other systems 
the medford  sheridan  redding  fresno  visalia  merced  las vegas and rapid city systems acquired during generated  in the aggregate  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of million 
excluding these acquisitions  the company s loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  approximated million 
income tax matters ati and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal tax return 
the company has had no state or federal income tax expense since inception 
as of december   the company had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes  expiring through section of the internal revenue code limits the amount of loss carryforwards that a company can use to offset future income upon the occurrence of certain changes in ownership 
the issuance of moderate amounts of certain types of new equity could limit the company s ability to use net operating losses to offset future gains from the sale of assets  thus requiring the company to pay income taxes on gains received in such asset sales 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires impairment losses to be recognized for long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
the resultant impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
the company adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations at the time of adoption 
as previously described  during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that indicators of impairment were present 
as a result  a charge of million was recognized to write down the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value 
the company follows the guidelines established by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure of stock based compensation  which established an alternative method of expense recognition for stock based compensation awards to employees based on fair values 
the company elected not to adopt the statement for expense recognition purposes 
on march   the fasb released sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement for all periods presented 
basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to fully diluted earnings per share pursuant to accounting principles bulletin no 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december   and when adopted  it will require restatement of prior years earnings per share 
since the effect of outstanding options is antidilutive  they have been excluded from the company s computation of net loss per share 
accordingly  management does not believe that sfas no 
will have an impact upon historical net loss per share as reported 
inflation inflation has not affected the company s operations significantly during the past three years 
the company believes that its ability to increase charges for services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures
