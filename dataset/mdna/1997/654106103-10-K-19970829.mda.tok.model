us apparel exceeded billion in revenues for the first time  increasing million  or  over the previous year 
revenues from international non us markets increased over the previous year  and now represent of total revenues 
markets outside the us in which the company operates  continue to offer tremendous opportunity for growth 
the company continues to invest in infrastructure and local marketing and advertising to capitalize on these opportunities 
through aggressive worldwide marketing efforts and global infrastructure spending  the company is positioning itself to maintain and to expand markets and gain market share on a worldwide basis 
the company experienced revenue growth in fiscal in all breakout categories see chart 
us footwear represents the largest increase in total dollars  improving by almost billion  or  as a result of more pairs sold and a increase in average selling price 
the increase in average selling price was due to a change in product mix as well as increased prices in effect during the second half of the fiscal year in certain categories 
men s basketball  men s running  men s cross training  kids  and women s fitness comprise approximately of the total us footwear business  and individually increased    and  respectively 
brand jordan and golf categories increased significantly over the prior year  improving and  respectively 
two categories experienced revenue reductions  men s court and outdoor  down and  respectively 
us apparel experienced growth in all categories  demonstrating the strength of the nike brand 
brand revenues outside of the us increased billion  or 
the us dollar strengthened against nearly all currencies 
had the us dollar remained constant with that of the prior year  non us revenues would have increased billion  or 
by region  asia pacific increased million  or on a constant dollar basis  europe increased million  or on a constant dollar basis and the americas which includes canada and latin america increased million  or on a constant dollar basis 
the most significant increases were in japan  korea  united kingdom  italy  and canada 
other brands  which includes bauer inc  cole haan  sports specialties  corp  and tetra plastics  inc  decreased to million 
the company expects revenue growth in fiscal to be affected by strong demand for the nike brand on a global scale  and reduced growth rates in the us given the significance of the existing market share 
the breakdown of revenues follows year ended may  chg chg chg in thousands united states footwear    united states apparel    total united states    non us non us    non us non us    total non us    other brands    total nike    gross margins increased to of revenues in fiscal  exceeding for the first time in company history 
the improved percentage was principally driven by price increases in certain us footwear categories in effect the second half of the year 
this was offset by slight reductions in gross margin percentages from increased close out sales as a percentage of total sales  most predominately at bauer  due to the softening of the in line skate market and liquidation of non bauer brand product to consolidate to a single bauer brand 
global fiscal margins could be affected negatively by increasing product costs  badded infrastructure to support higher levels of operations  and increased sales of lower priced product including close outs 
selling and administrative expenses represented of revenues compared with in the prior year 
nike brand expenses increased in the us and million outside the us increases were largely driven by increased sales and marketing spending  as well as infrastructure related costs to support growth outside the us the company intends to continue to invest in growth opportunities and worldwide marketing and advertising in order to ensure the successful sell through of orders discussed below 
interest expense increased million due to increased short term and new long term borrowings needed to fund the increased level of operations  including increased working capital requirements and infrastructure 
see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
other income expense was a net expense of million in fiscal  compared with million in the majority of the reduction was attributable to increased interest income  higher gain on disposal of assets and income from a new promotional event staged in japan  offset by an one time bauer restructuring charge of million  which includes  among other things  moving certain products to offshore production and the closing of certain facilities 
worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel  scheduled for delivery from june through november   were approximately billion  higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders and the percentage growth in these orders are not necessarily indicative of the growth in revenues which the company will experience for the subsequent periods 
this is because the mix of advance futures and orders at once has shifted significantly toward advance futures orders as the nike brand and futures program become more established in all areas  specifically in the non us regions 
the mix of orders will continue to vary as the non us operations continue to account for a greater percentage of total revenues and place a greater emphasis on futures programs 
finally  exchange rates can cause differences in comparisons 
since the company operates globally  it is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the effect of fluctuations on the company s foreign currency transactions  the company uses highly liquid foreign currency spot  forward and purchased options with high credit quality financial institutions 
the company transacts in foreign exchange contracts to hedge underlying economic exposures and does not transact in derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
where possible  the company nets its foreign exchange exposures to take advantage of natural offsets that occur in the normal course of business 
firmly committed transactions and the related receivables and payables may be hedged with forward exchange contracts or purchased options 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed transactions  may be hedged through the use of purchased options 
additional information concerning the company s hedging activities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s non us operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad  such as the imposition of import quotas or anti dumping duties 
in  the eu commission  at the request of the european footwear manufacturers  initiated two anti dumping investigations covering certain footwear imported from the people s republic of china  indonesia and thailand 
in january  the commission imposed significant provisional anti dumping duties on textile upper shoes imported from china and indonesia 
the commission has not yet adopted permanent measures nor measures for leather synthetic shoes  and the company is unable to determine whether the commission will do so 
nevertheless  the investigations and the anti dumping duties expressly exclude footwear designed for a sporting activity  and the company does not currently believe that the commission will change the exclusion 
while the exclusion is subject to interpretation and or amendment by customs authorities  the company believes that most of its footwear sourced in the target countries for sale in the eu fits within the exclusion and  therefore  the company will not be materially affected by the results of the antidumping investigations 
if the company s footwear were not covered by the exclusion  the company would consider  in addition to its possible legal remedies  shifting the production of such footwear to other countries in order to maintain competitive pricing 
the company believes that it is prepared to deal effectively with any such anti dumping measures that may arise and that any adverse impact would be of a short term nature 
the company continues to closely monitor international trade restrictions and to adopt its multi country sourcing strategy and contingency plans 
the company believes that its major competitors would be similarly impacted by any such restrictions 
as further explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  prior to fiscal year  certain of the company s non us operations reported their results of operations on a one month lag which allowed more time to compile results 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  the one month lag was eliminated and the may charge from operations for these entities of million was recorded to retained earnings 
this change did not have a material effect on the annual results of operations  however  quarterly results changed as certain reporting periods shifted one month 
the selected quarterly data section includes adjusted quarterly data for fiscal year as if the change had been in effect 
fiscal compared to fiscal significant growth in worldwide revenues and improved leverage of selling and administrative costs were the primary factors contributing to record earnings for fiscal year as compared to the company experienced revenue growth in fiscal in all breakout categories

other brands increased million  or  over the prior year 
bauer  which was acquired at the end of the company s third quarter of fiscal  contributed million of the increase 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in the slight reduction in gross margins compared with was primarily driven by increased costs of air freight to meet delivery dates on increasing customer orders  and increased footwear product costs not fully recovered through the selling price 
these higher expenses were partially offset by improved apparel margins due to significant increases in revenues and a reduction in close outs as a percentage of total revenues 
total selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to as compared to in the reduction can be attributed primarily to significant increases in revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was million  or 
us operations increased million and non us increased million  largely a result of increased sales and marketing spending as well as infrastructure to support growth outside the us bauer accounted for million of the increase 
interest expense increased million due primarily to the higher levels of short term borrowings needed to fund current operations

other income expense rose million in expense over  primarily as a result of increased goodwill amortization from the acquisition of bauer  a reduction in interest income due to a net lower cash position compared with the prior year  and increased profit share expense due to increased earnings 
these were partially offset by the absence of non recurring specific obligations which occurred in the prior year related to the shutdown for certain facilities in conjunction with the consolidation of european warehouses

working capital increased million  and the company s current ratio increased to at may  from at fiscal year end 
cash provided by operations decreased slightly to million for the year ended may   primarily due to improved operating results offset by increased working capital requirements  given the global growth of the company 
specifically  inventories increased million  representing growth in nearly all areas of the company 
us footwear and apparel inventories increased million and million  respectively 
the largest increases outside of the us were in the european and asia pacific regions with increases of million and million  respectively  due primarily to the significant increase in operations

additions to property  plant and equipment for fiscal were million  an increase of million over additions in the us totaled million for the year due to continued overall expansion of us operations which includes warehouse locations  management information systems  world headquarters expansion and the continued development of niketown retail locations 
outside the us  additions totaled million  compared to million for fiscal  and relates to the continued expansion of infrastructure  investments in information systems and new nike retail locations 
the remaining additions relate to other brands 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal approximate million  with the primary components consisting of the continued expansion of the world headquarters  new niketown retail locations and warehouse expansion in the us  japan and korea 
additions to long term debt of approximately million in fiscal  were used to fund the significant increase in property  plant and equipment  as well as increased working capital requirements 
in june  the company s japanese subsidiary borrowed billion yen approximately million in a private placement  maturing june   to fund construction of a warehouse and distribution center and for other corporate purposes 
additionally  during december the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the sale of up to million of debt securities 
the filing will enable the company to issue debt from time to time during the next several years 
under this program  the company issued million seven year notes in december  maturing december   and subsequent to may   an additional million medium term notes were issued  maturing in three to five years 
the proceeds were swapped into dutch guilders to obtain long term fixed rate financing to support the growth of the company s european operations 
management believes that significant funds generated by operations  together with access to sufficient sources of funds  will adequately meet its anticipated operating  global infrastructure expansion and capital needs 
significant short and long term lines of credit are maintained with banks which  along with cash on hand  provide adequate operating liquidity 
liquidity is also provided by the company s commercial paper program under which there was outstanding at both may  and dividends per share of common stock for fiscal rose 
over fiscal to
