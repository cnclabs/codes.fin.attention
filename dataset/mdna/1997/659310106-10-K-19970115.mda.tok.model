item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee and the managing director  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
such payments are required when owners of shares of stock in predecessor corporate entities  who have not previously presented their shares for conversion to units of beneficial interest in the trust  make such a presentation or furnish properly documented affidavits of loss and obtain an unlimited  open penalty bond 
the procedures for administering such claims are described in section of the trust agreement as deemed amended by the february  order of the delaware court of chancery 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see item  legal proceedings  and note to financial statements contained herein 
the trust has no means of assuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which  with sales volumes  form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the mark dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income of  was lower than the previous year 
a combination of production interruptions  lower sales from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg  moderately weaker gas prices and less favorable currency exchange rates contributed to the decline in royalties 
the interruptions in production resulted from two events planned improvements to the grossenkneten desulfurization plant and a pipeline accident isolating the visbek and cappeln gas fields in western oldenburg 
the plant improvements occurred at two separate times from late april to early june and during the month of august and increased the plant capacity to  cubic meters of gas per hour 
during this combined week period  the plant was shut down completely for weeks and partially for weeks 
the pipeline accident occurred shortly after the resumption of production in early june 
production from these fields was totally shut down for weeks and partially shut down for weeks 
the net effect of these interruptions helped to reduce overall oldenburg gas sales by only to billion cubic feet 
however  gas sales from western oldenburg  with an effective royalty seven times greater than eastern oldenburg  were reduced by to billion cubic feet 
gas prices for both eastern and western oldenburg declined by and respectively 
from their lowest level experienced during the second quarter  gas prices have steadily climbed through the remainder of the year 
in addition  the average exchange rate for eastern and western oldenburg also declined by and respectively 
for the year the average value of the deutsche mark was cents down from last year s average of cents 
in prior years  we made note of the steps taken by the operating companies to maintain current sales levels despite the increasing ratio of sour gas to sweet gas in the total product mix 
these steps included improvements to the grossenkneten plant as well as the construction of a pipeline to the neag desulfurization plant to utilize excess capacity at that plant 
with the discovery of additional reserves outside oldenburg  the owners of the neag desulfurization plant are currently utilizing that plant s entire capacity for non oldenburg gas 
therefore the recent increases to the capacity at grossenkneten do not increase the total production capacity but instead permit that capacity to be maintained at the previous level of  cu 
meters per hour 
over of the trust s current year royalties came from oldenburg gas sales  royalties from oil sales were  and from sulfur sales were  during fiscal the trust did not receive any royalties under the mobil sulfur royalty because prices remained below the threshold level specified in the agreement 
despite reaching over per metric ton recorded in the third quarter  sulfur prices ended the year below per metric ton 
trust expenses of  increased from the prior year reflecting increased legal expenses in connection with the settlement of the suit previously commenced by the delaware state escheator and with costs associated with investigations into the status of certain leases in germany 
despite higher average interest rates in effect  interest income declined by due to the decrease in funds available for investment 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional  and  trust units were issued and  and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
in addition on april   in compliance with the terms of the settlement with delaware  the trust issued  units to the delaware state escheator 
the increase in the number of issued units resulted in a dilution reducing subsequent per unit income by that percentage 
beyond the dilution from this and future issuances of units  the settlement will have no impact on the trust s financial condition  result of operations or long or short term liquidity 
the termination of liability for payment of arrears of dividends or distributions after the year as specified in the settlement approval order of the delaware court of chancery is expected to benefit the trust s financial condition 
see note to financial statements contained herein 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income of  was higher than the previous year 
a combination of increased sales from the higher royalty area of western oldenburg and a strong deutsche mark yielded the increased royalties 
in contrast to the prior year  when the partial shutdown of the grossenkneten desulfurization plant significantly affected the amount of royalties received in the third and fourth quarters  no such unusual or extended interruption of production occurred during fiscal since last year s partial shutdown affected production of saleable gas from the higher royalty western portion of oldenburg to a greater degree  in the increase in production and sales was slanted toward gas from the west 
total gas sales of billion cubic feet from the higher royalty western area increased by while gas sales of billion cubic feet for all of oldenburg only increased by 
in addition  the continued strength of the deutsche mark throughout the year contributed to the amount of dollars received by the trust upon the transfer of funds from germany 
for the year  the average value of the deutsche mark increased from cents to cents  an improvement of 
while gas prices  which averaged pfennigs per kwh  declined somewhat from the prior year and for western and overall oldenburg respectively  the negative effect of that decline was easily offset by the increases in sales and exchange rates 
there have been no payments under the mobil sulfur royalty  since the most recent sulfur price of dm per metric ton is well below the threshold for the resumption of royalty payments 
the world sulfur situation looks to deteriorate further as a result of world wide over supply and continued increases in the removal of sulfur from petroleum products for environmental compliance 
trust expenses of  showed a decrease of nearly  reflecting a reduction in legal expenses as well as the absence of audit expenses in the off year of the biennial audit cycle of the operating companies in germany 
the increase in interest income to  reflects both the increase of funds available for investment as well as somewhat higher rates available through the exclusive use of treasury bills for short term investments 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional  and  trust units were issued and  and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond
