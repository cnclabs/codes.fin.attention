item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was incorporated in to provide software products for developing and deploying intelligent systems for decision support and control 
the company released the first version of g  its core product  in may  and has been profitable each year since since  the company has released enhanced versions of g  has introduced add on products that complement g in areas of data connectivity and graphical user interfaces  and has further expanded its product line to include g based application products 
in addition  the company derives significant service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services  and training courses related to its software products 
the company markets and sells its products through its direct sales offices in the united states  europe  africa  and asia  as well as through selected distributors in other countries  including japan 
in  the company made a strategic decision to aggressively expand its direct sales force and consulting services organization  leading to an increase in both product and service revenues in and the company also sells its products through a network of value added resellers and systems integrators who provide consulting services and integrated solutions to their customers 
the company believes that there is a trend among end users in its markets toward purchasing complete solutions  rather than software tools with which to develop such solutions 
this trend has increased the company s reliance on such value added resellers and systems integrators to provide consulting services and integrated solutions to end users  and has lead the company to increase its own capabilities to deliver complete solutions directly

in addition  the company has million of equipment under long term operating leases 
the company s lease commitments consist of operating leases primarily for the company s facilities and computers 
the company generated cash from operations of million for the year ended december   used  in cash for operations in and generated million in cash from operations in cash generated from operations in was primarily due to increased net income and increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments of million 
the company regularly invests excess funds in highly rated money market funds  government securities  and commercial paper 
included in these balances are the proceeds from the company s initial public offering of common stock in february a total of  shares of common stock were sold in the offering  of which  were sold by the company and  were sold by the selling stockholders 
the net proceeds received by the company were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses of the offering 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
in addition  the company has received approximately  in through the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares through the employee stock purchase plan 
at december   the company had available a bank line of credit allowing for borrowings up to million and providing for interest at the current prime rate 
this bank line of credit will expire on may  the bank line of credit requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the bank line of credit at december  there were no borrowings under the bank line of credit for the year ended december  investing activities utilized cash of million  million and  for the years ended  and  respectively 
the principal uses in were to fund the purchase of million of short term investments   in long term investments and million of property and equipment 
the company expects that its requirements for computers  office facilities  and office equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate and that such equipment and facilities will be available when needed 
the company believes that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s business requirements at least through december  certain factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that could offset the company s operating results  including  without limitation  the following emerging market for intelligent systems 
substantially  all of the company s revenues are derived from the licensing and support of software products that enable organizations to implement intelligent systems for decision support and control applications 
although many organizations have begun to deploy  or have announced plans to deploy  intelligent systems  these systems are different from the basic monitoring and control systems that are traditionally employed by these organizations 
there can be no assurance that these organizations will be able to introduce intelligent systems successfully nor that such systems will gain widespread acceptance 
in addition  the timing of the implementation of intelligent systems by organizations may be affected by economic factors  government regulations  and other factors 
delays in the introduction of intelligent systems or the failure of these systems to gain widespread market acceptance would materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  the company believes that end users in its market are increasingly seeking complete solutions  rather than software tools with which to develop such solutions 
meeting this demand has required the company to modify its sales approach and increase its capabilities to deliver complete solutions 
the company is also increasingly reliant on value added resellers and systems integrators to deliver services to implement these solutions 
the modified sales approach may also lengthen the company s average sales cycle 
failure by the company to respond appropriately to such a shift in market demand could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company has experienced  and may experience in the future  significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
although the company has been profitable for each of the past seven fiscal years  the company has  on occasion  recorded quarterly losses  and there can be no assurance that revenue growth or profitable operations can be sustained on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company s sales cycle typically ranges from six to months  and the cost of acquiring the company s software  building and deploying applications  and training users represents a significant expenditure for customers 
the company s relatively long sales cycle and high license fees  together with fixed short term expenses  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  based on a relatively small variation in the timing of major orders 
factors such as the timing of new product introductions and upgrades  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  and the mix of domestic versus international revenues could contribute to this quarterly variability 
for example  the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  delays in customer maintenance renewals due to unforeseen delays in product releases 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenue levels 
a shortfall in expected revenues could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
the company s financial performance has generally been somewhat weaker in the first quarter than in the other fiscal quarters  due to customer purchasing patterns 
economic factors 
because capital expenditures are often viewed as discretionary by organizations  sales of the company s products for capital budget projects are subject to general economic conditions 
such capital expenditures are also susceptible to industry specific economic downturns 
certain industries have experienced weakened demand in the past  which has adversely affected the company s revenues  gross margin  and operating results during such periods 
there can be no assurance that future recessionary conditions in the markets for the company s products will not adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
product concentration 
the company s only current product offerings are g  an object oriented development and deployment environment for building intelligent systems  and software products which operate in conjunction with g accordingly  the company s business and financial results are substantially dependent upon the continued customer acceptance and deployment of g and related products 
the timing of major g releases may affect the timing of purchases of the company s products 
the company has introduced several g based products for building applications and is developing others 
the company believes that market acceptance of these products will be important to the company s future growth 
there can be no assurance that such products will achieve market acceptance or that new products will be successfully developed 
in addition  the company relies on many of its marketing partners to develop g based products for specialized markets 
accordingly  the company s business and financial results are also linked to the continued successful development by its marketing partners and market acceptance of such g based products 
any decline in the demand for g and related products  whether as a result of competitive products  price competition  the lack of success of the company s marketing partners  technological change  or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
new products and rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products is relatively new and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  and frequent new product introductions  and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products  to introduce new products and features to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards  and to manage transitions from one product release to the next 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in introducing new products and product enhancements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  and marketing of new products  and product enhancements 
also there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of new or enhanced products  that the company will successfully manage the transition to future versions of g  or that the company s future products will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products and products currently under development obsolete and unmarketable 
from time to time  the company or others may announce new products  capabilities  or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of currently planned or other new product offerings will not cause customers to defer purchasing existing company products 
see emerging market for intelligent systems 
reliance upon indirect distribution channels 
the company sells its products in part through value added resellers  systems integrators  and distributors  none of which is under the control of the company 
sales of the company s products by value added resellers and systems integrators represented  and of the company s product revenues in  and  respectively 
sales of the company s products by distributors  primarily the company s japanese distributor  accounted for  and of the company s product revenues in  and  respectively 
the loss of one or more major third party distributors or resellers of the company s products  a significant decline in their sales  or difficulty on the part of such third party developers or resellers in developing successful g based products and applications  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain additional qualified third party resellers or that third party resellers will be able to effectively sell and implement the company s products 
in addition  the company relies on third party resellers to provide post sales service and support to its customers  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
risks associated with international operations 
the company s international revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues are categorized by the company according to product shipment destination and therefore do not necessarily reflect the ultimate country of installation 
the international portion of the company s business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including difficulties in building and managing international operations  difficulties in localizing products and translating documentation into local languages  fluctuations in the value of international currencies  fluctuating import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic  or political changes in international markets 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
potential for undetected errors 
complex software products such as those offered by the company may contain unintended errors or failures commonly referred to as bugs 
there can be no assurance that  despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such errors or defects to date  there can be no assurance that errors or defects will not be discovered in the future  causing delays in product introduction and shipments or requiring design modifications that could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
competition 
although the company believes that there are no other commercially available products that offer the full range of high level capabilities embodied in the company s products  a number of companies offer point solution products that perform certain functions of the company s products 
moreover  new competitors could enter the intelligent systems market  and existing competitors could expand the capabilities of their products to equal or exceed those of the company s products 
in addition  there are commercially available software development tools that software application developers or potential customers could use to build software having functionality similar to the company s products 
the company s software is integrated into industry specific solutions by value added resellers 
a number of software companies offer products that compete in specific application areas addressed by these value added resellers  such as cement kiln control and refinery scheduling  and could be successful in supplying alternatives to products based on the company s software 
the company s products can also be used to perform lower level functions such as monitoring  supervisory control  cell control  and other similar functions that do not utilize all of g s capabilities 
for these functions  g competes with products offered by a number of other companies 
the company believes that its products compete favorably in these functional areas where breadth of applicability  flexibility  maintainability  scalability  and ease of use are important considerations 
however  certain competitors in this category have greater financial and other resources than the company and might introduce new or improved products to compete with g  possibly at lower prices 
the company believes that continued investment in research and development and sales and marketing will be required to maintain its competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products or provide services that are superior to the company s products or services or achieve greater market acceptance 
competitive pressures faced by the company could force the company to reduce its prices  which could result in reduced profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
dependence upon proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  contract  copyright  patent  and trademark law to protect its proprietary rights in its products and technology 
the company enters into confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  third party resellers  and end users and limits access to  and distribution of its software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
in addition  the company has placed technical inhibitors in its software that prevent such software from running on unauthorized computers 
however  effective patent  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products are distributed 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties  or that third parties will not be able to independently develop similar technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future or that such claims will not be successful 
management of growth 
the company s business has grown significantly over the past several years 
this growth has resulted in an increase in responsibilities placed upon the company s management and has placed added pressures on the company s operating and financial systems 
for example  the company s expansion of its international operations introduced significant legal  tax  and accounting complexities  as well as the challenges associated with managing geographically dispersed operations 
to manage its growth effectively  the company will be required to implement additional management and financial systems and controls  and to expand  train  and manage its employee base 
there can be no assurance that the management and systems currently in place will be adequate if the company continues to grow  or that the company will be able to implement additional systems successfully and in a timely manner as required 
any future strategic transactions such as acquisitions or equity investments would place additional strains upon the company s management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be effective in managing its future growth or that any failure to manage growth will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends in large part upon certain key employees  the loss of any of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s key employees are not bound by employment agreements that require them to remain with the company 
the company s success will depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of certain key employees or the company s inability to attract and retain other qualified employees or to adequately replace key personnel who depart the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition
