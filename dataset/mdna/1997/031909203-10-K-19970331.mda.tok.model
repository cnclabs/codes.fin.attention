residential mortgage banking activities represented approximately of revenues and of operating profit before corporate and other of the company for the year ended december  the company believes that there are significant opportunities in the non conforming residential loan market and consequently expects residential mortgage banking activities to represent an increasing proportion of revenues and operating profits of the company in the future 
revenues from the company s residential mortgage banking activities consist of fees from originating residential mortgage loans  interest earned on residential mortgage loans originated and purchased  gains on the securitization and sale of such loans and other related securities and accrued earnings on retained interests in securitizations 
the gains on securitization and sale of mortgage loans and other related securities represent the amount by which the proceeds received including the estimated value of retained interests exceed the basis of the assets sold and the cost of securitization 
when loans are securitized and sold  the retained interests are valued at the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be realized over the anticipated average life of the assets sold after future estimated credit losses  estimated prepayments and normal servicing and other fees related to assets sold 
cash flows from retained interests in securitizations are generally subordinated to other security holders in a securitization trust 
the discounted present value of such retained interests is computed using management s assumptions of market discount rates  prepayment rates  default rates  credit losses and other costs 
revenues from the company s commercial mortgage banking activities are earned from the origination and underwriting of commercial real estate mortgage loans  the placement of such loans with permanent investors and the servicing of loans 
loan placement and servicing fees  commitment fees and real estate brokerage commissions are recognized as earned

revenues from the company s asset management activities primarily consist of earnings on wholly owned portfolios and fees charged for the management of asset portfolios comprised of performing  non performing or under performing real estate  commercial  industrial and agricultural loans and for the successful resolution of the assets within such asset portfolios 
the original cost of an investment in an asset portfolio is allocated to individual assets within that asset portfolio based on their relative fair value to the total purchase price 
the difference between gross estimated cash flows from loans and asset backed and other securities and its present value is accrued using the level yield method 
the level yield method recognizes income as the product of the recorded investment and the expected rate of return 
the expected rate of return is based upon estimated cash flows of the investments 
the recorded investment is reduced based on cash collections allocated to principal 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the recorded investments by reviewing the estimated remaining amount and timing of cash flows and adjusts  if necessary  investments or expected rates of return 
the company accounts for its investments in partnerships and joint ventures using the equity method which generally results in the pass through of its pro rata share of earnings as if it had a direct investment in the underlying loans 
loans  partnerships and joint ventures  and real estate are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
the company s investments in asset backed and other securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value determined by discounting estimated cash flows at current market rates 
any unrealized gains losses on asset backed and other securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax effects 
the asset base of each asset portfolio declines over the life of the asset portfolio  thus reducing asset management fees as assets within the asset portfolio are resolved 
in addition  management and resolution fees are earned from partnership and joint ventures 
these fees are subject to fluctuation based on the consideration received  timing of the sale or collection of the partnership and joint venture assets and the attainment of specified earnings levels on behalf of investors or investment partners
