item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
product groups the company has three principal product groups computer mass data storage products and instrumentation recorders including its dst tape drives and robotic library systems  its dis and dcrsi instrumentation products  and related tape and after market equipment  professional video recording products primarily its dct video recorders and image processing systems and related tape products  and other products consisting principally of television after market equipment 
no other class of similar products accounted for more than of net sales during the comparison periods discussed below 
during the past three years  the company has focused its efforts on high performance digital data storage and delivery systems for the emerging commercial mass data storage market  and has discontinued many older products and businesses 
the company operates in one industry segment for financial reporting purposes the design  development  production and distribution of high speed  high capacity magnetic recording products and systems 
results of operations for the three years ended december  net sales 
net sales increased slightly to million in from million in compared to million in during  sales of the company s millimeter tape based mass data storage and instrumentation products increased significantly from sales levels realized in  offsetting the decline in sales of its professional video recording products and other products 
the decline in net sales from to resulted primarily from product eliminations and market withdrawals in connection with the restructuring of the company s business operations as illustrated in the table below  as well as the discontinuance of oem sales of dst products 
net sales in recent years have also been impacted by the closing of several international sales offices as part of the company s restructuring activities 
sales to foreign customers including us export sales declined to million in of net sales  from million in of net sales  and million in of net sales 
during the three years ended december   sales backlog has declined from million in  to million in and to million in accordingly  future periods net sales will be increasingly dependent upon current order activity 
in addition  future results may be impacted by declines in government procurement of instrumentation products and the effects of the company s recent consolidation of its manufacturing facilities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that quarterly sales levels in fiscal will attain levels realized during the comparable quarters of fiscal the following table shows sales of the company s continuing products for the past three years 
sales of products that have been discontinued consisting primarily of older video recording equipment  related after market products and computer systems products are shown separately 
c m net sales in millions mass data storage instrumentation professional video other products total continuing products total discontinued products total net sales mass data storage products and instrumentation recorders 
sales of data storage products and instrumentation products and related after market products experienced a increase from to and a slight decline from to the results reflect significant increases in sales of millimeter data storage products  reflecting the introduction of dis instrumentation versions of dst products and a high level of sales to customers in the oil and gas industry in the first quarter of fiscal  partially offset by declines in sales of dcrsi instrumentation recorders 
see business distribution and customers  above 
substantially all of the company s sales of its first generation dst products were made in the first half of to a major oem customer pursuant to a non recurring contract 
these sales accounted for of total dst product sales in when the company announced its new line of lower priced dst tape drives and robotic libraries in july  its oem arrangements were terminated and the company began to expand its dst direct marketing activities 
as previously disclosed in order for dst product sales to increase significantly  the company believes that it will be necessary for the products to gain broader acceptance in commercial markets  in addition to the specialized technical markets from which most of the company s revenue from millimeter products is currently derived 
see markets mass data storage products and instrumentation recorders  above 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced a new version of its millimeter mass data storage products that will double the amount of data that can be stored on a single cartridge 
although the availability of this new version is intended to enhance the company s competitive position  it could cause a decline in sales of the company s existing millimeter products 
a significant portion of instrumentation product sales reflect purchases by the federal government 
direct and indirect sales to us government agencies amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of net sales in those years 
while sales to government agencies have historically consisted primarily of instrumentation recorders  the company has recently experienced an increase in sales of data storage products to these customers 
sales to government agencies fluctuate as a result of changes in government spending programs including defense programs  and may also be impacted by pending budget discussions in congress 
the company is unable to forecast the extent to which sales may be adversely affected in future periods by these factors 
see also business distribution and customers and business markets mass data storage products and instrumentation recorders  above 
professional video recording products 
the company has streamlined its video product line to concentrate on products that utilize the company s proprietary digital compression and image processing technology 
most of the declines in and resulted from the discontinuation of older analog products 
c m sales of the company s dct digital products have also declined during the past three years  as the company has closed certain domestic and international sales offices as part of its restructuring 
the reduced distribution network for the company s video products is expected to have a continuing negative impact on sales of these products 
however  dct products accounted for of video product sales in  compared to in and in in future periods  the company expects that its sales of professional video recording products will consist almost exclusively of dct video recorders and image processing systems 
other products 
net sales from all other products consisting primarily of television after market products have decreased significantly as the company has narrowed its professional television product line 
sales of other products  such as turnkey studio facilities  mobile vans  computer core memory products  ceramic materials and refurbished equipment accepted as trade ins on new equipment sales  were essentially eliminated by the end of the company expects that in the future  sales of all other products will consist almost exclusively of television after market equipment relating to television products that the company now manufactures  or that it manufactured in prior periods and continues to support 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in and in  which represents a significant improvement from in the improved gross margins reflect the effects of the company s restructuring activities  which have reduced fixed manufacturing and administrative costs  as well as an improved sales mix of newer  higher margin products 
if sales of the company s relatively high margin instrumentation recorders are adversely affected by pressure on government agencies to reduce spending  gross margins in future periods could be adversely affected 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to the increase of million was entirely related to the ongoing patent infringement litigation with a foreign consumer products manufacturer 
the company did not incur any patent infringement litigation costs during or the company expects to continue to incur litigation costs during the first half of at similar levels to those incurred in the last half of see legal proceedings above 
the company anticipates that beginning in  it should begin to realize savings in facilities operating costs from levels incurred in as a result of relocating its redwood city  california operations into smaller facilities 
however  a variety of unanticipated events such as property tax increases  uninsured property damage losses  unexpected maintenance problems or other occurrences could reduce or eliminate anticipated cost savings 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses were million in compared to million in and million in these expenses represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the company does not capitalize any material amounts of rd e expenditures 
the majority of rd e expenses in and were used to enhance the price performance levels of the company s mass storage products  as well as to integrate the company s mass storage systems with various computer manufacturers servers  workstations and other computer systems 
since the second half of  the company has also been investing in the development of its keepered media technology 
see business research  development and engineering  above 
the company is committed to investing in research  development and engineering programs at levels that can be supported by current levels of sales  and the company currently anticipates that such expenses in may increase over levels as a percentage of net sales 
see business research  development and engineering  above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
royalty income 
royalty income was million in compared to million in and million in ampex records patent royalties when income is earned and receipt is assured 
the company s royalty income derives from patent licenses  and the company receives most of its royalty income from licenses with companies that manufacture consumer video products such as vcrs and camcorders and  in certain cases  professional video tape recorders 
during this period a growing portion of royalty income related to mm video recorders and camcorders 
c m approximately million of royalty income was non recurring royalties resulting from negotiated settlements related to prior sales of products by licensees 
this compares to million and million of non recurring royalty income in and  respectively 
royalty income has historically fluctuated widely due to a number of factors that the company cannot predict  such as the extent of use of the company s patented technology by third parties  the extent to which the company must pursue litigation in order to enforce its patents  and the ultimate success of its licensing and litigation activities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a lawsuit against a major foreign manufacturer of vhs video recorders and television receivers in which the company alleges patent infringement 
see legal proceedings  above 
if additional lawsuits are brought against other manufacturers  litigation costs will increase 
the company is also attempting to negotiate license agreements with additional manufacturers of mm camcorders 
however  there can be no assurance that such licensing efforts including any litigation that may be required will be successful 
see business patents  licenses and trademarks  above 
restructuring charges credits 
the restructuring charges recorded in earlier years included accruals for severance costs  estimated vacated lease obligations including termination costs and the closure of certain foreign subsidiaries 
during and the company entered into transactions that reduced its anticipated obligations under several vacated leases 
in addition  certain expenses related to the closure of foreign subsidiaries were less than originally anticipated 
these factors resulted in restructuring credits of million and million during and  respectively 
as of december   the company had a remaining balance of million of accrued restructuring costs 
the company will continue to evaluate the amount of accrued restructuring costs on a quarterly basis  and the company may make additional adjustments in future periods if it determines that its actual obligations will differ significantly from the amounts accrued 
operating income 
the company generated operating income of million in  million in and million in operating income was of net sales in  of net sales in and of net sales in non recurring royalty income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
selling and administrative expenses for includes million related to patent infringement litigation costs 
restructuring charges credits were million in compared to million in excluding the above items  operating income would have been million  million and million for  and  respectively 
this year over year improvement in operating income  as adjusted  reflects the effects on gross profit of the company s restructuring activities  its improved sales mix of products and continued controls on recurring selling and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in the decreases from to resulted primarily from the april exchange of senior discount notes  issued in  for cumulative convertible preferred stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from the conversion of the zero coupon notes with a principal amount at maturity of million into approximately million shares of common stock during the first quarter of in january  the mortgage on the real property in redwood city  california was repaid from the cash proceeds of the sale 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of debt finance costs 
these amounts reflect periodic amortization of financing costs over the remaining terms of the debt 
due to the conversion of the zero coupon notes and the retirement of the mortgage in  all remaining deferred financing costs were written off during interest income 
interest income increased significantly to million in from million in and million in higher cash balances and imputed interest on the notes received in connection with the sale of the company s redwood city  california property in january resulted in the increase in see properties  above  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the slight increase from to is a result of higher cash balances and higher interest rates 
c m other income expense  net 
in  other income expense  net included a gain of million on the sale of the smaller of its two manufacturing facilities in colorado springs  colorado offset by moving related expenditures of million 
in  other income expense  net  included a gain of million resulting from the company s termination of health care benefits for retirees  as well as gains from the sale of certain real property and other assets in connection with the company s restructuring activities 
for  other income expense  net  consisted primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from the company s foreign operations 
provision for income taxes 
as a result of timing differences in december  and december   the company was not required to include any provision for us federal tax liabilities in or in  the company was required to set up a provision for alternative minimum tax amt of million due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset the gain on the sale of the redwood city  california real property 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of million expiring in the years through as a result of the financing transactions that were completed in april and february  the company is limited in the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset consolidated federal income tax liabilities of the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derives pretax foreign income from its international operations  which are conducted principally by its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s royalty income is subject  in certain cases  to foreign tax withholding 
such income is taxed by foreign taxing authorities  and the company s domestic interest and amortization expenses and operating losses  if any  are not deductible in computing such foreign taxes 
the provisions for income taxes in  and consist primarily of foreign income taxes and withholding taxes on royalty income 
gain of business held for disposition 
in november  the company completed the disposition of its media subsidiaries  which had been accounted for as a business held for disposition since the quarter ended june  the sale did not result in the receipt of any cash proceeds by the company and the non recurring gain of million in represented the elimination of net liabilities of media  less taxes and other costs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income 
the company reported net income of million in  million in and million in net income benefited from the non recurring gain of million on the sale of media in  and from the factors discussed above in operating income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow 
at december   the company had cash and short term investments of million  up significantly from million at december  working capital improved to million at december   from million at december  the improvement in cash and working capital was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of portions of its redwood city  california and colorado springs  colorado facilities 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s operating activities used cash of million during  and generated cash of million in the decline in operating cash flow for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to the factors discussed above in net income  to other moving related expenditures of million  and to a net increase in inventories resulting from the implementation of the company s previously announced strategy to increase inventories in anticipation of increased dst product sales 
while the company began shipping its dst library system in the fourth quarter of  it presently has no material backlog of orders for this product 
the increased investment in inventories  particularly with respect to its dst product  which has limited sales history  may expose the company to an increased risk of inventory write offs 
cash flows from investing activities and financing activities for reflect the company s sale of real estate in colorado and california 
the company has available a working capital facility that allows it to borrow or obtain letters of credit totaling million through may  based on eligible accounts receivable 
at december   the c m company had no material borrowings outstanding and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million 
financing transactions 
in january  the company repaid the balance of the million mortgage loan on the redwood city property from a portion of the cash proceeds of the sale 
also  during  the company s convertible notes with an aggregate face amount at maturity of million were converted into approximately million shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase approximately million shares were exercised 
in december  the company is scheduled to redeem the outstanding noncumulative preferred stock out of funds legally available therefor generally  the excess of the value of assets over liabilities 
in certain instances the company may redeem the noncumulative preferred stock by issuing common stock at of fair market value 
as of december   the company does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem the noncumulative preferred stock 
in the event the company does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem the noncumulative preferred stock in full on the redemption date  the company would remain obligated to redeem such shares from time to time thereafter to the extent funds become legally available for redemption  and would generally be precluded from declaring any cash dividends on  or repurchasing shares of  its common stock  until the noncumulative preferred stock has been redeemed in full 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that the company will have adequate liquidity or have funds legally available to redeem the noncumulative preferred stock on the redemption date or in the future 
although the company has no current plans for redemption of the noncumulative preferred stock prior to maturity  it will continue to evaluate this possibility in light of market conditions  its liquidity and other factors 
any such redemption could include issuance of additional debt or equity securities or other actions that might result in dilution of current stockholders equity interests in the company 
in the second quarter of  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering  shares of common stock which may be offered from time to time by the company  the proceeds of which would be used for general corporate purposes  including  if required  the acquisition of specialized production and test equipment for use in the company s keepered media development program 
see keepered media development program 
the sale of common stock covered by the shelf registration statement could adversely affect the market price for the common stock  and would dilute current stockholders interests by approximately if all such shares were to be issued
