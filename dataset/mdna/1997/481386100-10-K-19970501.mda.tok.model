the company s working capital needs have been funded through a combination of external financing including long term debt and proceeds from the company s ipo in  proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in  and proceeds from a two million share common stock offering in  internally generated funds and credit terms from vendors 
historically  the company s working capital needs peak in the fourth fiscal quarter 
operating activities in fiscal provided cash of million compared to cash usage of million in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to decreased inventories associated with the inventory clearance sale during the second and third quarters of the current fiscal year 
net cash of million was used in investing activities during fiscal compared to million net cash used in investing activities in fiscal the decrease was primarily related to a reduction in new construction

cash flows used in financing activities were million in fiscal as compared to million provided in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to less borrowing activity on the company s revolving line of credit from the prior year  the result of lower investing activities for new stores and increased cash from the second quarter inventory clearance

the revolving credit facility bears interest on outstanding balances  at the company s option  at the lender s prime rate plus  or libor plus  subject to a maximum basis point increase or a basis point decrease based on certain predetermined criteria 
the company s total anticipated capital expenditures are expected to be less than million for fiscal including amounts for new store expansion  improvements in existing stores  and other capital expenditures
