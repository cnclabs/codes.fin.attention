liquidity and capital resources finlay s capital requirements are primarily for funding working capital for new departments and for working capital growth of existing departments and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures for opening new departments and renovating existing departments 
in addition  future working capital requirements would be increased by further international expansion 
for  capital expenditures totalled million and in totalled million 
capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately million in capital expenditures are limited by the terms of the revolving credit facility 
finlay s operations substantially preclude consumer receivables and approximately of finlay s domestic merchandise is carried on consignment 
accordingly  finlay believes that relatively modest levels of working capital are required in comparison to many other retailers 
the company s working capital balance was million at february   an increase of million from february  the increase resulted primarily from the impact of s net income exclusive of depreciation and amortization  partially offset by capital expenditures 
based on the seasonal nature of finlay s business  working capital levels can be expected to decrease on an interim basis during the first three quarters of a year 
see seasonality 
the seasonality of finlay s business causes working capital requirements to reach their highest level in the months of october and november in anticipation of the holiday shopping season 
accordingly  finlay experiences seasonal cash needs as inventory levels peak 
the revolving credit facility with ge capital provides finlay with a line of credit of up to million which is available to finance seasonal cash and other working capital needs 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to  at finlay s option  i the index rate as defined in the revolving credit facility plus or ii adjusted libor plus

and sonab for the benefit of the lenders under the revolving credit facility 
finlay is required to reduce the balance of the revolving credit facility in each year to million or less for a consecutive day period  and immediately thereafter to zero for an additional consecutive days the balance reduction requirement 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility at february  or at february  in accordance with the balance reduction requirement 
the average amounts outstanding for and were million and million  respectively 
the maximum amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility in was million 
simultaneously with the acquisition of sonab on october   ge capital agreed to provide additional financing by increasing the revolving credit facility from million to million 
the company believes that  with the increased borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility  it has sufficient liquidity to meet sonab s anticipated working capital requirements 
finlay s long term needs for external financing will depend on its rate of growth  the level of internally generated funds and the ability to continue obtaining substantial amounts of merchandise on advantageous terms  including consignment arrangements with its vendors 
for  finlay had an average balance of consignment merchandise of million from over vendors as compared to an average balance of million in at the end of  million of consignment merchandise was on hand as compared with million at the end of see business store relationships and business purchasing and inventory

as of february   finlay s outstanding borrowings were million  which included a million balance under the debentures and a million balance under the notes 
the debentures do not pay cash interest until november in august  finlay jewelry consummated the gold consignment agreement with riht 
the gold consignment agreement enables finlay jewelry to pay for merchandise by providing gold  or otherwise making payment  to certain vendors 
finlay jewelry can obtain  pursuant to the gold consignment agreement  up to the lesser of i  fine troy ounces or ii million worth of gold  subject to a formula as prescribed by the gold consignment agreement 
at february   amounts outstanding under the gold consignment agreement totalled  fine troy ounces  valued at approximately million

of the net proceeds  million was utilized to repurchase million accreted balance of debentures 
the balance of the net proceeds were contributed to finlay jewelry by reducing a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
finlay believes that  based upon current operations  anticipated growth  availability under the revolving credit facility including availability as a result of the offering and the anticipated availability of additional debt financing  finlay jewelry will  for the foreseeable future  be able to meet its debt service and anticipated working capital obligations  and to make distributions to the company sufficient to permit the company to meet its debt service obligations and to pay certain other expenses as they come due 
no assurances  however  can be given that finlay jewelry s current level of operating results will continue or improve or that finlay jewelry s income from operations will continue to be sufficient to permit finlay jewelry and the company to meet their debt service and other obligations 
the revolving credit facility  the note indenture and the gold consignment agreement restrict distributions from finlay jewelry to the company to of finlay jewelry s net sales for the preceding fiscal year 
the amounts required to satisfy the aggregate of finlay jewelry s interest expense and required amortization payments totalled million and million for and  respectively 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code restricts utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nols after an ownership change exceeding 
as a result of the recapitalization transactions  a change in ownership of the company exceeding occurred within the meaning of section of the code 
similar restrictions apply to other carryforwards 
consequently  there is a material limitation on the company s annual utilization of its nols and other carryforwards which requires a deferral or loss of the utilization of such nols or other carryforwards 
the company had  at october  the company s tax year end  a nol for tax purposes of approximately million which is subject to an annual limit of approximately million per year 
for financial reporting purposes  no nol exists as of february  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality finlay s business is highly seasonal  with peak sales occurring during the fourth quarter of each year  which includes the christmas season november december 
the fourth quarter accounted for an average of of finlay s annual sales and approximately of its income from operations excluding nonrecurring charges for  and accordingly  the results for any of the first three quarters of a year  taken individually or in the aggregate  are not indicative of annual results

forward looking information this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements  including statements concerning expected capital expenditures and the adequacy of finlay s sources of cash to finance its current and future operations as well as its debt service and other obligations
