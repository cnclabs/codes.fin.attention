item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation profitability in the hog slaughter industry is affected by the cost and supply of hogs and pork product selling prices 
the slaughtering industry has generally been characterized by relatively narrow profit margins and a trend toward larger  higher volume plants in order to reduce per unit costs 
processed meat and poultry processors generally receive higher profit margins on premium labeled items than on fresh pork and by products 
hog prices represent the principal production cost of pork slaughterers and are an important element in the cost of certain processed meat products as well 
hog prices and hog supply are determined by constantly changing market forces 
the ability of hog slaughterers and processors to maintain satisfactory margins may be affected by market factors over which such industry participants have limited control  including  in addition to the supply and price of live hogs  industry wide slaughter levels  competition  the relative price of substitute products  overall domestic retail demand and the level of exports 
negatively affecting the company and others in the slaughtering industry is the continuing lack of market hogs available for slaughter compared with the industry s slaughter capacity 
the continued imbalance between the industry s slaughter capacity and the availability of market hogs has created a situation in which increases in raw material prices have outpaced increases in selling prices 
although the company does not expect profitability to improve in its fresh meats operations in the near term  the company believes that the recent high levels of hog producer profitability will encourage additional hog production  which should allow this industry segment to return to more profitable levels
