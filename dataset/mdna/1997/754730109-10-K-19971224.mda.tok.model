have limited the ability to realize a proportionate increase in trading profits 
the increase in financial service fees in fiscal and is a combined result of the general growth of the company s retail client base and recent dramatic growth in transaction fees arising from our retail wrap fee account programs  which have become increasingly popular as an alternative to the traditional commission based pricing structure 
other income in fiscal includes a gain of million from the compan y s sale of its former headquarters building

incentive compensation expenses are based on departmental  subsidiary and firm wide profitability and reflect the record earnings in fiscal and record underwriting activity has resulted in a dramatic increase in investment banking departmental profits  having a significant impact on incentive compensation 
the increases in communications and information processing expense in fiscal and reflect the costs of further enhancement and expansion of the company s systems of internal communication and information dissemination  as well as higher general business volume which gave rise to increased costs for telephone  printing and supplies 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expense between fiscal and is predominantly the increased depreciation on additional information processing equipment 
the increase also includes expenses associated with upgraded retail office space and account executive workstations  which have been a primary factor in the past two years increases 
the rise in other expenses is primarily the result of higher legal expenses and settlements  and increased subadvisory fees paid to unaffiliated portfolio managers in our investment advisory services program 
the widespread use of computer programs that rely on two digit date programs to perform computations and decision making functions may cause computer systems to malfunction in the year and lead to significant business delays and disruptions in the u

the company is also monitoring the progress of the supplier of its securities processing software and other industry suppliers in addressing this issue 
while management has not finalized an estimate of the cost of internal system modifications  it does not believe that these costs will have a material impact on the company s operations in fiscal the impact of this problem on the securities industry will be material  however  since virtually every aspect of the sale of securities and processing of transactions will be affected 
due to the enormous task facing the securities industry  and the interdependent nature of securities transactions  the company may be adversely affected by this problem in the year depending on whether it and the entities with whom it does business address this issue successfully
