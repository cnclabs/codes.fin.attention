the effect of this restatement was to reduce net income as reported previously for the year ended march  by approximately million or 
per share 
the primary contributors to the increase in net sales from continuing operations in were an increase in sales in the construction supplies group due to an expanded market area and product line  and the inclusion of atmosphere annealing since the acquisition of this company in january sales also increased at pak sak due to a change in customer mix 
a significant contributor to the improvement in income from continuing operations in the current year was approximately million in operating earnings generated by atmosphere annealing since maxco acquired this operation in january in addition  earnings increased in the current year at pak sak due primarily to its sales volume increase

increased volumes and margins at the construction supplies group enabled these units to generate an increase in operating earnings over the comparable period in the prior year 
operating income improvements at the construction supplies group were affected by reduced operating earnings at pak sak 
the increase in interest expense for continuing operations was primarily due to increased borrowings under the company s line of credit 
continuing operations were also affected by the inclusion in the current year of an equity loss of million related to the company s investment in medar 
the company s effective tax rate varied from the company s statutory rate of due to certain expenses  which are not deductible for tax purposes
