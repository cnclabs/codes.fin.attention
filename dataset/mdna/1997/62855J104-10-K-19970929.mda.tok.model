the company recognized  in revenue under this agreement for the year ended june  in october  the company announced the introduction of bracanalysis tm  a comprehensive brca and brca gene sequence analysis for susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary myriad labs  began accepting testing samples on a commercial basis on october  genetic testing revenues of  were recognized for the year ended june  in january  the company announced the identification of a major gene responsible for glioma  a form of brain cancer that is a leading killer of children with cancer 
in march the company further announced that the identified gene was also found to be associated with other advanced cancers of the prostate  breast  kidney and skin 
mmac was located through a collaborative effort by scientists at the company and mda 
it is anticipated that the discovery of mmac will lead to the development of new molecular diagnostic and therapeutic products for cancer 
there can be no assurance  however  that the identification of this gene will lead to the development of diagnostic tests or therapeutic products 
in april  the uspto granted a patent covering mts gene mutations 
the composition of matter patent on the gene mutations  which are believed to be associated with melanoma  was issued to myriad and the university

results of operations years ended june  and research revenues for the company s fiscal year ended june  increased  from the prior year to  the increase was attributable to the company s corporate research collaboration agreements providing ongoing research funding 
the fiscal year ended june  was the company s first full year of involvement with bayer  in addition to the collaborative research agreement initiated with schering in april research revenue from the research collaboration agreements is recognized as related costs are incurred 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase  revenues increase proportionately 
genetic testing revenues of  were recognized in the fiscal year ended june  the company anticipates genetic testing revenue to increase in the future as cancer centers develop internal protocols for handling samples  additional insurance companies offer reimbursement for such tests  and market awareness of such tests is increased 
the company anticipates an improved gross margin in the future as increased sales reduce inefficiencies related to underutilization of capacity 
there can be no assurance  however  that any of these factors will be realized or that genetic testing revenues will continue to increase at the historical rate 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in research activities as a result of the progress in the company s collaborations with novartis  bayer and schering as well as those programs funded by the company  including the successful collaborative effort by the company and scientists at mda in discovering the mmac gene 
the increased level of research spending includes third party research programs  increased depreciation charges related to purchasing of additional research equipment  the hiring of additional research personnel and the associated increase in use of laboratory supplies and reagents 
the company also incurred increased development expenses during the year related to work on developing and launching bracanalysis tm  its genetic predisposition test for susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer 
such expenses will likely increase to the extent that the company enters into additional research agreements with third parties 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased  from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the ongoing promotion of bracanalysis tm as well as additional administrative  sales  marketing and education personnel  market research activities  educational material development  legal fees associated with filing world wide patent applications on the company s gene discoveries  product liability insurance premiums  and facilities related costs 
the company expects its selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in support of its genetic predisposition testing business and its research and development efforts 
interest income for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the funds available for investment  which were raised in the company s private placement of preferred stock in february  its research and development collaborations entered into with novartis and bayer in april and september  respectively  its initial public offering ipo in october  and its research and development collaboration with schering in april much of these funds  while raised in the previous fiscal year  were held by the company for the entire fiscal year ended june  interest expense for the year ended june   amounting to  was due entirely to borrowings under the company s equipment financing facility

prepaid expenses increased  during the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to royalties paid in advance in order to take advantage of early payment discounts 
trade receivables increased  during fiscal reflecting amounts due from insurance companies and major cancer centers for genetic predisposition testing services provided by myriad labs 
the increase in non trade receivables of  for the fiscal year ended june  is the result of certain legal fees which the company has incurred and which will be reimbursed by one of the company s collaborative partners 
accounts payable increased between june  and june  as a result of the company s growth 
deferred revenue  representing the difference in collaborative payments received and research revenue recognized  increased  with the continued payments from novartis  bayer and schering to the company 
as expenses related to the projects continue to increase and the associated research revenue is recognized  deferred revenue will decrease 
the company s investing activities provided cash of  in the year ended june  and used cash of  in the year ended june  investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures for research equipment  office furniture  and facility expansion 
during the year ended june   the company shifted a portion of its investment in marketable securities from longer term investments to cash and cash equivalents in order to provide for ongoing corporate expenditures 
financing activities provided  during the year ended june  and provided  in the year ended june  financing activities were comprised primarily of schering s equity investment in april during fiscal year the company reduced the principal on its equipment financing facility by  to  the company entered into equipment financing agreements with two commercial financial institutions in december under those agreements  the company borrowed  the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  including the net proceeds of its initial public offering and interest earned thereon  will be adequate to maintain its current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time 
the company s future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors  including progress of the company s research and development programs  the results and cost of clinical correlation testing of the company s genetic tests  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  payments received under collaborative agreements  changes in collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of its gene discoveries  if any  including the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  the cost and availability of third party financing for capital expenditures and administrative and legal expenses 
because of the company s significant long term capital requirements  the company intends to raise funds when conditions are favorable  even if it does not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time
