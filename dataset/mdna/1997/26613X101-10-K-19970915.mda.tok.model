general during the early s  the photomask market was relatively flat 
while growth in semiconductor manufacturing and new semiconductor designs generated demand for new photomasks throughout this period  the company believes that this underlying growth was offset by advances in semiconductor and photomask design and production methods that reduced the number of photomasks required to manufacture a semiconductor device 
the company believes that weak market conditions during this period contributed to the poor financial performance of several merchant photomask manufacturers  including the company 
since that time  however  growth in the photomask market has resumed 
the company s sales increased from million in to million in the increase of over was primarily the result of an accelerating trend in the semiconductor industry toward semiconductor device customization  which generates demand for new photomasks  semiconductor device complexity  which increases the value and number of photomask layers needed to produce a semiconductor device  and the proliferation of semiconductor devices into new products and markets 
the company s sales continued to be internationally diverse 
north american sales constituted approximately of the company s sales in and  while sales in europe and asia accounted for approximately and of sales in and and in sales in north america grew approximately from to from million to million 
sales in europe grew approximately from to from million to million 
sales in asia grew approximately from to from million to million 
the company expects sales in non us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
due to the capital intensive nature of photomask manufacturing operations  at a given threshold of manufacturing capacity  a high proportion of the company s operating costs remain relatively constant as sales volume increases or decreases 
to the extent that the company has under utilized production capacity  operating profit increases or decreases significantly as sales volume increases or decreases 
in the early s  the company had excess capacity 
therefore  as sales increased from to  costs associated with manufacturing remained relatively unchanged and the company s operating profit over the period benefited 
the company anticipates that operating costs will increase as it adds capacity to position itself for future growth 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales sales are comprised primarily of photomask sales to semiconductor manufacturers 
sales increased from million in to million in sales in north america  europe and asia increased from million  million and million in to million  million and million in a continued increase in the demand for advanced photomasks  which have higher average selling prices  was a primary contributor to the increase in sales during this period 
this shift in demand reflects a trend toward higher utilization of complex semiconductor devices with finer linewidths 
the increase in sales during this period also reflects the overall increase in demand for photomasks 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of material  labor  depreciation and overhead 
cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in resulting primarily from higher costs associated with increased sales 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily due to continued improvements in capacity utilization including increased use of internally sourced photoblanks and pellicles 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes salaries of sales personnel  marketing expense  general and administrative expense and product distribution expense 
prior to january   general and administrative expense principally included allocated costs for services provided by centralized dupont organizations 
these allocated costs are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the company had been independent 
since january   general and administrative expense includes fees incurred by the company under administrative services agreements with dupont and certain dupont subsidiaries administrative service agreements 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased from in to in selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in the increases were due largely to increases in selling expenses corresponding to increased sales and increases in incentive compensation expenses corresponding to increases in earnings 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of employee costs  cost of material consumed  depreciation  engineering related costs and the company s allocated share of dupont s central research and development 
these allocations were million in such allocations terminated december  since that date  the company has received services from dupont central research and development pursuant to a research  development and consulting agreement with dupont 
research and development expense  excluding dupont allocations  increased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expense increased slightly compared to the prior year 
the increases reflect pre operating losses from the company s joint venture participation  with advance micro devices  micron technology and motorola  in a limited liability company called the dpi reticle technology center  llc rtc which was formed to develop advanced photomask technology and pilot line fabricate leading edge photomasks 
the company believes that  through its participation in the rtc  it will be able to help meet the future technology needs of the semiconductor industry for advanced photomasks 
there can be no assurance that the rtc will yield results that are favorable to the company 
research and development expense is net of funds the company received from customers  industry groups such as sematech inc and the joint european submicron strategic initiative and government sources 
the company anticipates that research and development expense will continue to increase in absolute terms in the future reflecting the company s strategy of advancing its technological leadership 
however  there can be no assurance that such expenditures will enable the company to develop new technologies or to maintain its technological leadership 
other operating expense other operating expense consists primarily of costs not directly related to the manufacture of the company s products 
historically  a significant portion of this item has been pre operating losses related to new facilities and the expense associated with the early retirement of equipment resulting from technological obsolescence 
the photomask industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements which may  in the future  result in additional technological obsolescence 
the timing and amounts of these retirements are uncertain and difficult to predict 
also  as the company adds capacity to position itself for future growth  it will incur additional pre operating losses related to new facilities 
other operating expense decreased from million in to million in interest income expense interest expense was million in and interest income was million in the primary source of interest expense in was the company s master note arrangements with dupont 
on june   dupont contributed the million balance outstanding on the master notes to the company as a capital contribution 
interest income results from short term investment of the company s cash balances 
exchange gain loss exchange gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the company s accounts denominated in non us currencies into us dollars  which is the company s functional currency 
exchange loss was million in and million in the loss is primarily due to fluctuations of the us dollar against the german mark  french franc and korean won 
exchange gain loss is net of the impact of hedging activities designed to reduce exchange rate exposure 
provision for income taxes prior to the initial public offering  tax expense was determined and allocated to the company by applying the separate taxpayer approach outlined in fas under this approach  the company had net operating loss carryforwards in the us and europe  some of which became fully utilized during the year ended june  the company s operations in korea are subject to a government granted tax exemption 
the company will continue to enjoy the full benefits of the tax exemption in korea until and a partial benefit thereafter until the tax exemption terminates in in actuality  the company s results prior to the initial public offering were included in consolidated tax returns filed by dupont and the tax benefit of prior year losses was realized by dupont 
since the initial public offering  tax expense has been determined in accordance with fas and approximates the us statutory rate 
minority interest in loss of majority owned joint venture the minority interest impact of the company s joint venture in china was million in compared to million in  reflecting increased pre operating losses from  and partner funding of  the joint venture 
extraordinary item in january  the company sold its entire investment in etec systems  inc common stock 
aggregate net proceeds from the sale of million will be used in operations 
the company realized a million gain on the sale 
the related provision for income taxes was million 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales sales increased from million in to million in sales in north america  europe and asia increased from million  million and million in to million  million and million in a continued increase in the demand for advanced photomasks  which have higher average selling prices  was a primary contributor to the increase in sales during this period 
this shift in demand reflects a trend toward higher utilization of complex semiconductor devices with finer linewidths 
the increase in sales during this period also reflects the overall increase in demand for photomasks 
in addition  approximately million of photomask sales to lucent technologies lucent were generated during under a five year supply agreement executed in connection with the april purchase of selected photomask manufacturing equipment from an affiliate of at t 
under the terms of the supply agreement  lucent has agreed to purchase certain minimum quantities of photomasks from the company 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in resulting primarily from higher costs associated with increased sales 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily due to continued improvements in capacity utilization including increased use of internally sourced photoblanks and pellicles 
selling  general and administrative expense prior to january   general and administrative expense principally included allocated costs for services provided by centralized dupont organizations 
these allocated costs are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the company had been independent 
since january   general and administrative expense includes fees incurred by the company under administrative service agreements 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined from in to in selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in the increase was due largely to increases in selling expenses corresponding to increased sales 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of employee costs  cost of material consumed  depreciation of equipment  engineering related costs and the company s allocated share of dupont s central research and development 
these allocations were million and million in and such allocations terminated december  prospectively  the company will receive services from dupont central research and development pursuant to a research  development and consulting agreement with dupont 
research and development expense  excluding dupont allocations  increased from million in to million in however  as a percentage of sales  research and development expense declined slightly compared to the prior year  reflecting increased sales 
research and development expense is net of funds the company received from customers  industry groups such as sematech inc and the joint european submicron strategic initiative and government sources 
other operating expense other operating expense decreased from million in to million in interest expense interest expense was essentially flat at approximately million for both and exchange gain loss exchange gain was million in compared to an exchange loss of million in the loss in was primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the us dollar against the german mark  french franc and korean won 
provision for income taxes tax expense has been determined and allocated to the company by applying the separate taxpayer approach outlined in fas under this approach  the company had net operating loss carryforwards in the us and europe  some of which became fully utilized during the year ended june  the company s operations in korea are subject to a government granted tax exemption 
the company will continue to enjoy the full benefits of the tax exemption in korea until and a partial benefit thereafter until the tax exemption terminates in in actuality  the company s results were included in consolidated tax returns filed by dupont and the tax benefit of prior year losses was realized by dupont 
minority interest in loss of majority owned joint venture the minority interest impact of the company s joint venture in china was million in compared to million in  reflecting increased pre operating losses from  and partner funding of  the joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was million at june  and million at june  the increase in working capital for the year ended june  is due principally to higher cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june   million at june  and million at june  the increase in was primarily due to the company retaining a portion of the net proceeds of the initial public offering 
the increase in was primarily due to the company retaining a portion of the cash generated from operations and the cash proceeds from the sale of the company s investment in etec systems  inc common stock 
the company s ongoing cash requirements will be for capital expenditures  research and product development and working capital 
cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in the company believes that cash provided by operations will be the company s primary source of liquidity 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the company s most significant use of cash for investing activities was capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the company expects capital expenditures in will be approximately million 
the capital expenditures for will be used primarily to expand the company s manufacturing capacity and advance the company s technical capability 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million in and cash provided by financing activities was million in prior to the company s initial public offering  it participated in dupont s centralized cash management system whereby substantially all of the net cash generated by the company was transferred  principally via the master notes  to dupont 
the company and dupont have entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which dupont has agreed to provide a credit facility to the company in an aggregate amount of million 
the credit agreement has a term of months and any loans thereunder will bear interest at libor plus basis points 
at the company s option  advances under the credit agreement are convertible into term loans with maturities up to seven years 
the credit facility will serve as a back up to cash from operations 
to date  there have been no borrowings under the credit facility 
there can be no assurance that alternative sources of financing will be available upon the expiration of such facility or that alternative sources of funding will be available if the company s borrowing requirements exceed the facility 
the credit agreement contains  among other things  covenants restricting the company s ability to incur additional debt 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  even if funding is available  the terms thereof will be attractive to the company 
other matters non us operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative value of currencies and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative value of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the financial statements reflect remeasurement of items denominated in non us currencies to us dollars  the company s functional currency 
exchange gains or losses are included in income in the period in which they occur 
prior to the initial public offering  dupont managed the company s exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as part of its overall management of exchange rate exposure 
no separate hedging of the company s exchange rate exposure was undertaken 
accordingly  the financial statements prior to the initial public offering do not reflect any hedging activities 
effective with the completion of the initial public offering  the company monitors its exchange rate exposure and attempts to reduce such exposure by hedging 
in  the company entered into korean won forward contracts designed to reduce such exposure 
there can be no assurance that such forward contracts or any other hedging activity will be adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of the company s exchange rate exposure 
the risks associated with non us operations have not  to date  had a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity and results of operations 
there can  however  be no assurance that such risks will not have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity and results of operations in the future 
inflation impacts the company through increases in the cost of labor  services and raw materials 
in general  these increases have been mitigated by periodic increases in the prices of the company s products 
discussion of pro forma the unaudited pro forma income statement estimates the effects that the initial public offering  various realignment transactions and the following would have had on the company s results of operations had they occurred as of july  i the discontinuance of dupont s postretirement benefits and replacement of dupont s defined benefit pension plan with the company s defined contribution pension plan  ii the elimination of dupont allocated overhead expenses that are not expected to be incurred by the company following the initial public offering  iii the cost of services to be provided by third parties or dupont  pursuant to several transitional agreements  and additional employees assumed to be hired by the company to replace those services previously provided by dupont  and iv recognition of expenses relating to the company s stock performance plan 
the principal effect of these adjustments would have been a decrease in costs of goods sold of million for in addition  selling  general and administrative expense would have increased by million for and research and development expense would have decreased million for as a result of these adjustments  operating profit would have increased by million for furthermore  elimination of the master notes would have decreased interest expense by million for net income  after an increase in the provision for income taxes  would have decreased by million for
