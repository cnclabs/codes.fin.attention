item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k annual report 
trade secrets  patents  and trademarks proprietary protection for the company s technology and body of knowledge is extremely important to hauser s business 
the company relies on patents  trade secrets  and confidentiality agreements  as well as continuing technological innovation  to develop and maintain its competitive position 
management believes the company has established a distinct competitive advantage with its proprietary technologies and sophisticated knowledge of the extraction and purification of natural products 
this expertise enables the company to produce certain products which management believes could not be duplicated without the use of the company s technologies 
the end products processed by the company are typically at higher yield  better quality and lower cost than those produced solely by conventional methods 
the company has developed numerous proprietary technologies to process natural raw materials and produce specialized natural products 
the company s expertise in analyzing  identifying and measuring low concentration compounds  occurring in natural materials and in process streams  is important to raw material analysis  process development  and process and quality control 
designing a particular process application involves selecting the most appropriate processing steps  determining the proper sequence  and establishing optimum temperature  pressure  solvent and other parameters for each process step 
the company develops variations of its processes based on the nature of the raw material used and the specifications of the desired product 
for example  the company s dynamic liquid solid extraction 
servicemark 
dl se 
servicemark 
isolation process  typically the first step  is particularly effective at producing liquid extracts from solid natural materials  such as roots  bark  seeds and leaves 
relative to conventional methods  dl se 
servicemark 
produces a more highly concentrated extract that can be valuable in itself as a product  or alternatively  can simplify the subsequent steps required to isolate an enriched extract or purified natural chemical 
dl se 
servicemark 
can capture a broader range of components  such as the top notes of pepper  which improves the quality of the final product 
top notes are the highly volatile chemical components of an extract  such as a flavor  which can easily evaporate  the loss of which reduces the quality or character of the flavor 
the company s purification process  liquid liquid focusing 
service mark 
llf 
servicemark  is highly versatile and can be used in place of more costly chromatography methods 
it is often the method of choice as the second step in a process 
the company has determined that it would be difficult to adequately police a patent of certain of its proprietary processes  therefore  it has elected to rely on internal procedures and trade secret laws to protect these and other proprietary processing technologies as trade secrets 
disclosure in a patent could be used by third parties in a manner which would not be susceptible to discovery by the company  so protection against infringement would be difficult 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information  processes and techniques  or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or disclose such technology  or that the company can meaningfully protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets 
the company protects its proprietary technology and knowledge through established security practices and confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  strategic industry participants  and technical advisors 
few individuals within the company possess a full working knowledge of these processes  although a somewhat larger number of key employees and several former employees have some working knowledge of various aspects and applications of these processes 
joint development agreements and consultant relationships generally allow only limited access to company information  which is protected through confidentiality agreements with the parties involved 
management recognizes that disputes could arise as to proprietary rights should technological information  independently developed by sponsors or consultants  be applied to company projects 
there can be no assurance that confidentiality agreements or other procedures will provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
however  in the past  the company has vigorously defended protection of its trade secrets through the court system  both federal and state  and believes that it has proven by this means that the company has viable protectable trade secrets as defined by the colorado uniform trade secrets act  crs sect 
et seq 
two such cases  now settled  involved the alleged dissemination to unauthorized persons  of hauser s proprietary process for the extraction and purification of paclitaxel 
in addition  there are finite terms on several of the company s confidentiality agreements with strategic industry participants which the company may not be able to extend upon expiration 
however  since the company is continually improving its processes and developing additional technological knowledge relating to the extraction and purification of natural products  management believes that  although the loss of trade secret or confidential status of some portions of its technology or processes could affect it materially and adversely  it would not eliminate the company s ability to remain competitive 
patents hauser patents technology when appropriate to obtain long term protection 
the company owns patents for proprietary chemical substances  composition of matter  and manufacturing processes 
in addition  many patents are still pending 
trademarks and servicemarks the company has several trademarks and servicemarks either registered or pending  including certified assay 
trademark  stabilenhance

the servicemark hauser has been registered to the company 
seasonal aspects of the company s business there are no significant seasonal aspects to the company s business 
however  the company has experienced seasonality in the past in its natural flavor extracts product line primarily in advance of the demand for summer beverages in which most of that line s products are used 
the seasonality of this one product line from the natural ingredients business unit has no material impact on the company s combined operations 
inventory and sources and availability of raw materials significant amounts of certain raw materials are purchased into inventory during specified harvest seasons in order for the company to meet future production schedules 
through the summer of  the company harvested bark from pacific yew tree for use in the production of bulk paclitaxel 
hauser is no longer harvesting bark  as the production process to manufacture bulk paclitaxel is being modified to use a different biomass derived from cultivated sources 
during fiscal  the company completed the extraction of paclitaxel from its remaining bark inventory and will complete the purification process during fiscal this will provide finished goods inventory of bulk paclitaxel to satisfy expected customer demand for the next two to three years 
management believes that this will also give the company adequate time to complete necessary modifications for the extraction and purification of cultivated yew trees for future production 
in addition  the company purchases raw materials for its natural ingredients business when the raw material is available for harvest 
this may be well in advance of when production needs will require the material to fulfill customer demands 
raw materials essential to hauser s natural ingredients business unit are generally readily available from multiple sources 
any curtailment in the availability of such raw materials could be accompanied by production or other delays and increased raw material costs  with consequent adverse effects on hauser s business and results of operations 
substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply should not have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  the company has contracted with several nurseries for the planting and harvesting of cultivated yew trees for use in the production of paclitaxel 
the loss of any one of these suppliers could adversely affect the future operations of the company

renegotiation of government contracts no material portion of the company s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 
customers and competition the company competes primarily on the basis of process innovation  performance characteristics of its products  pricing  quality of service  and time to market 
further  the products provided by the company compete with other products in their respective markets 
pharmaceuticals for discussion of the company s two contracts to supply bulk paclitaxel  reference is made to part  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k annual report 
bristol holds exclusive marketing rights in the us for paclitaxel for refractory ovarian cancer until december  bristol also has five years of protection from generic drug competition for the first indication  and three years for subsequent indications  each ending in december  this protection falls under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of waxman hatch act 
this limited exclusivity provides bristol no protection against the introduction of new compounds  even if they are chemically related 
management believes that bristol has applied for and received marketing approval for its paclitaxel final product which is produced at its facility in ireland 
many other companies  including the company and ahp  are currently poised to enter the us and worldwide paclitaxel market when bristol s exclusive rights expire 
as discussed in item legal proceedings of this form k annual report  bristol has named the company and yew tree in a lawsuit  alleging patent infringement in europe 
bristol has also aggressively applied for and been granted patents related to paclitaxel based treatments in the united states of america 
such actions by bristol could substantially reduce the market for the company s paclitaxel based products 
the company believes that these actions by bristol will not be successful  and intends to devote significant resources to ensuring that this market opportunity can be realized 
this effort is expected to be substantial and may result in the expenditure of significant company resources 
if the company is not successful in these efforts  the inventory of paclitaxel valued by the company as of april  at  may be subject to significant revaluation 
many of the competitors of the company s pharmaceutical business unit have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than hauser 
in addition  the company may become subject to competition from existing or potential customers that could develop extraction and purification capabilities internally 
the company s paclitaxel processing business could be adversely affected long term new drug approval averages years by the successful development of competing sources or processes for the production of paclitaxel  or the development of paclitaxel related substances  such as simpler compounds with the activity of paclitaxel or paclitaxel prodrugs compounds which are not themselves drugs but are converted into drugs in the body 
there is a major effort underway to develop alternative raw materials for paclitaxel 
worldwide  many groups of scientists are seeking means to obtain paclitaxel from alternative renewable resources 
some of these companies and research institutions have developed and patented processes for producing paclitaxel in plant cell tissue culture and semi synthesis 
competition from other potential anti tumor compounds will be based on  among other things  product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price  time to market  and fda approval 
pharmaceuticals completed projects sanguinaria during fiscal  hauser announced that it had received purchase orders from colgate to produce sanguinaria extract  a natural antimicrobial in colgate s viadent 
registered trademark 
toothpaste and oral rinse products 
under the agreement  hauser produced sanguinaria over a month period 
hauser produced the sanguinaria in the original viadent 
registered trademark 
products in  when they were first introduced by vipont pharmaceuticals 
colgate acquired vipont in sanguinaria is extracted from the bloodroot plant  which grows abundantly in the southern united states 
this extract contains sanguinarine  which is the active anti plaque ingredient found in viadent 
registered trademark 
toothpaste and oral rinse  an over the counter regimen designed to reduce gum inflammation and treat gingivitis 
sanguinaria is also an ingredient in a similar line of colgate oral pharmaceuticals products sold in europe 
the company completed its production of sanguinaria extract for colgate during the third quarter of fiscal the expiration of this contract did not and will not have a material impact on the operations of the company pharmaceuticals significance of dependence upon a few customers dependence upon one or several customers has material significance only to the company s pharmaceuticals business unit 
ahp hauser believes that  through its agreement with ahp  the company will be able to take advantage of ahp s expertise in clinical testing  sales  marketing and distribution for the company s paclitaxel products 
there can be no assurance  however  that ahp will succeed in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to market paclitaxel in the united states or elsewhere  although approval has been obtained to sell generic paclitaxel in canada as of july  in addition  there can be no assurance that ahp will market paclitaxel successfully 
in that event  loss of revenues and royalties from the ahp agreement may have a material adverse effect on hauser 
in addition  while ahp has purchased minimum quantities of bulk paclitaxel from the company as required in the contract  ahp has no obligation to purchase additional product from hauser 
yew tree there can be no assurance that yew tree will succeed in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to market paclitaxel in europe  or elsewhere  or that they will market paclitaxel successfully 
in that event  loss of revenues from the company s yew tree agreement might have a material impact on hauser s operations 
reference is made to item legal proceedings of the form k annual report 
natural ingredients nutraceuticals hauser s strongest competition in the nutraceuticals arena comes from europe  in particular indena pharmaceuticals  madaus  muggenburg  schwabe  and finzelburg 
these european competitors sell bulk products directly or through agents or partners in the us some have warehousing and distribution in the us in general  these producers are larger than hauser  have years of experience  and established product lines 
there are several old line us companies that sell product into the nutraceuticals market 
most do not produce the standardized products that hauser produces  however  for regulatory reasons  many are developing standardized extracts at this time 
management believes that the company s expertise in the production of special products from natural sources and its extensive regulatory experience position it well in this market area and that the company can be a strong competitor in this market now and in the foreseeable future 
however  management is unable to precisely predict the amount of future revenues from these nutraceutical products 
natural flavor extracts in april  the company and its former partner tastemaker  jointly agreed to dissolve their strategic alliance to develop  market  and supply natural flavor extracts to the food and beverage industry 
the company assumed all responsibilities for marketing and sales of the natural flavor extracts of the joint venture in addition to their manufacture 
these and other natural flavor extracts are now marketed under hauser s brand name naturenhance 
trademark 
flavor extracts 
tastemaker has continued to purchase hauser s natural flavor extracts for use in its flavor compounds 
the company is marketing its flavor extracts directly to flavor houses  such as tastemaker  as well as to food and beverage companies that are former customers of the strategic alliance 
competition for products in the flavor extract market is based on flavor quality and concentration  availability  customer service  and price 
many of these factors are beyond the direct control of the company 
the company is competing with other natural extract manufacturers which include kalsec  folexco  and chart  and with flavor houses which produce their own natural extracts internally  such as mccormick and international flavors and fragrances 
natural food ingredients competition for the company s stabilenhance 
trademark 
brand is found in synthetic antioxidants such as bht and bha  and natural extracts such as tocopherols vitamin e and other rosemary extracts presently on the market 
even though there are many companies that produce all of these products  management believes that the product performance of its stabilenhance 
trademark 
line will make it competitive against both synthetic and natural products in this market 
technical services the market for technical services in the united states is large  diverse and highly fragmented 
the company competes with various companies depending on the specific type of services provided 
competition is based primarily on quality and breadth of service 
the company s competitive position depends on its ability to attract and retain scientific and other personnel  its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technologies  as well as its ability to implement expanded production plans 
research and development a key element in hauser s business strategy is to identify and develop commercial opportunities from ideas generated both through its internal research and development r d and through its consulting and contract r d operations 
management believes that certain opportunities merit internal funding 
these research and development efforts are generally devoted to five principal areas development of new technology  application of the company s processing technology to new products  improvement of existing processes  semi synthetic preparation of existing and new biologically active compounds  and development of viable alternate raw materials for natural products extraction and purification 
recent efforts in these areas have generated new products  such as rosemary antioxidants  and improved processes to manufacture paclitaxel from cultivated sources 
hauser also offers consultation and contract r d in the areas of product purification and isolation  product development  and process development and optimization 
the company is currently active in supporting the drug discovery and drug development efforts of its customers in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company also provides contract r d for customers in the flavors and cosmetic industries 
management believes that such endeavors may provide hauser with future manufacturing opportunities 
the company s internally funded research and development expenditures during fiscal   and  were approximately million  million  and million respectively 
hauser s research and development activities were partially funded by ahp during fiscal gross research costs  which include costs related to work for ahp under the r d agreement were approximately million in fiscal during fiscal and customer sponsored r d costs were approximately  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue actively pursuing research and development efforts and these costs are likely to increase in future periods 
government regulations the company s business is subject to comprehensive regulation throughout the world 
in the united states  regulations have been established by the fda with respect to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals  foods and flavors  environmental regulation by the us environmental protection agency epa with respect to the environment  by the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms with respect to alcohol used in flavors and research  by the colorado department of public health and environment  and the regulations established by the us departments of interior and agriculture to manage and protect wildlife and forest resources  including the pacific yew tree 
the fda  the epa  the departments of the interior and agriculture and other governmental agencies may in the future change existing regulations or adopt additional regulations that may affect the company s ability to acquire required raw materials  to manufacture bulk paclitaxel  or to develop or manufacture new products 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits can result in injunctive actions  product seizures  damages and civil and criminal penalties 
if the company expands or changes its existing operations or proposes any new operations  it may be required to obtain additional or amended permits or authorizations 
the company is also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal water pollution control act  and other federal  state  and local statutes and regulations 
the company believes it is in compliance with these and other laws in all material respects 
environmental regulations because of its ambient emissions of volatile organic compounds  some of which are considered toxic as well as flammable  all of the company s facilities are considered a source of hazardous air pollutants and subject to the clean air act amendments phased in requirements for such sources 
emission standards  established by the epa setting the maximum achievable control technology and best achievable control technology  limit hazardous air pollutant emissions from this category of sources  require a comprehensive air emission operating permit  which has been received by the company  and include related testing and reporting requirements 
the company believes its facilities are in compliance with applicable air pollution control requirements 
bureau of land management and us department of agriculture forest service regulations between  and the summer of  the company harvested bark from the pacific yew tree for use in the production of bulk paclitaxel 
the bureau of land management and the usda forest service work together to create uniform harvesting regulations on secondary forestry products on federally managed land 
the harvest of special forest products requires a permit for commercial uses  both state and federal 
prices for permits are variable and depend on many factors 
in addition to permits  loan tickets are required on products removed from federal lands 
land managing agencies do not allow harvesting in some areas  including areas of critical environmental concern  fenced enclosures and other experimental test sites 
areas where native americans exercise treaty rights or traditional cultural activities may also have restrictions 
agencies may restrict harvest by quantity  by specific methods  to specific locations  and by season of use 
many plants are considered sensitive  threatened  or endangered 
the company completed its last harvest of yew bark in the summer of in the future  raw materials for production of bulk paclitaxel will be derived from cultivated sources 
fda regulations pharmaceuticals paclitaxel to market and sell paclitaxel  ahp must demonstrate that the company manufactures paclitaxel according to current good manufacturing practices gmp 
the fda s gmp regulations require  among other things  that the company comply with certain minimum requirements in the facilities  methods  and controls used to manufacture the drug 
gmp regulations are designed to assure that the drug is safe and that it meets its purported identity  strength  quality and purity characteristics 
the company must follow stringent record keeping requirements in manufacturing and storing finished products intended for human use 
additionally  the company has filed with the fda drug master files which describe the company s manufacturing processes 
each drug master file is kept confidential between hauser and the fda  allowing the company to keep its manufacturing processes proprietary 
as long as the company is supplying bulk paclitaxel and other bulk pharmaceuticals for products to be sold in the united states  the company s manufacturing processes will continue to be subject to ongoing fda regulation and inspections to ensure compliance with gmp 
this may be time consuming and costly 
failure to comply with these practices may render the products adulterated and could subject the company and the drug to regulatory action by the fda 
although to date the company has not experienced any significant regulatory problems under gmp  there is no assurance that regulatory problems will not occur in the future as a result of expanded production in several of its facilities  new regulations  changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations or otherwise 
some states may have regulatory requirements in addition to the fda 
the company does not anticipate that complying with state regulations will pose any significant difficulties 
foreign countries may also have laws regulating drugs sold in those countries 
the company may  in the future  produce additional taxanes which will be subject to the same regulation as described above with respect to paclitaxel 
generic drugs the waxman hatch act was enacted to make more low cost generic drugs available to the public 
the waxman hatch act established an abbreviated new drug application procedure for generic drugs undergoing market approval before the fda 
the abbreviated new drug application anda procedure allows generic drugs to be approved by the fda if they are shown to be the bioequivalent of an approved drug 
a drug is considered bioequivalent to an approved drug if the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the approved drug when administered at the same molar dose of the therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in either a single dose or multiple doses 
the anda provision eliminates the expense and delay of proving the safety and effectiveness of a generic drug in clinical tests on humans when a pioneer drug manufacturer has already proven such requirements 
under the waxman hatch act  the fda must approve the anda within days from the time of filing  if the applicant shows that the conditions for prescribed  recommended  or suggested use for the new generic drug have been previously approved for a prior drug  the generic drug has the same active ingredients as the prior approved drug  the generic drug uses the same route of administration  dosage form and strength as the approved drug  the generic drug is the bioequivalent of an approved drug  and the labeling proposed for the generic drug is the same as the labeling approved for the prior drug 
additionally  the applicant must certify that  in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge  neither the generic drug nor its use is patented  or if patented  that the patent has expired  will expire or that the patent is invalid or will not be subject to infringement 
the waxman hatch act provides that pioneer drugs receive five years of exclusive market life 
the effective date of the exclusivity period is the date of nda approval of the pioneer drug 
this provision prohibits the approval of a generic equivalent for five years 
the waxman hatch act also grants days exclusivity to the first successful supplemental nda application against future competing supplemental nda versions of the product 
natural ingredients nutraceuticals nutraceutical products fit into the fda product category of dietary supplements 
this product category was established by the dietary supplement health and education act of the act and is separate from foods and drugs 
the act created a federal framework for the regulation of dietary supplements  guaranteeing consumer access to safe and beneficial products and to balanced information about their benefits 
the legislation recognized the importance of nutrition and the benefits of dietary supplements in health promotion 
it recognized that preventative health measures  including education  good nutrition  and appropriate use of safe dietary supplements can help reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and reduce long term health care expenditures 
under the act  dietary supplements are defined as vitamins  minerals  herbs or other botanicals  amino acids  or other dietary substances used to supplement the diet by increasing total dietary intake 
moreover  concentrates  metabolites  constituents  extracts  or any combination of these ingredients are also included in this definition 
tobacco is specifically excluded from the definition 
the act also states that where an ingredient is first marketed as a dietary supplement and is subsequently approved as a new drug  it can continue to be sold as a supplement unless the secretary of health and human services rules it would not be safe to do so 
conversely  an ingredient that is first approved as a new drug  or as an investigational new drug for which substantial and public clinical testing is in progress  may not be marketed as a dietary supplement unless the secretary determines it would be safe to do so under the food  drug and cosmetic act 
the act preserves the existing safety standards found in the food  drug and cosmetic act and provides additional safeguards to ensure that consumers are protected from products which present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in product labeling 
the bill also grants the secretary of health and human services emergency authority to remove a supplement from the marketplace if it poses an imminent hazard to public safety 
in such cases  the secretary must promptly convene on the record rule making to examine the evidence justifying the removal 
the act addresses dietary supplement claims and statements of nutritional support 
it establishes labeling practices regarding quality standards for supplements  including requirements concerning purity  disintegration and compositional specifications and also amends nutrition labeling and nutrient content claim requirements for dietary supplements under the nutrition labeling and education act of in addition  the act clarifies that the protections granted to vitamins and minerals under the proxmire amendment are extended to all dietary ingredients 
thus  dietary supplements cannot be treated as drugs solely on the basis of potency or combination 
food ingredients and flavor ingredients any products produced by the company for use in flavors or cosmetics are subject to federal and state regulations relating to grading  quality control  product branding and labeling and sanitary control 
additionally  due to alcohol content  the company s vanilla extract and other flavor extracts are regulated by the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms 
the us department of agriculture and the fda also regulate manufacture of foods and cosmetics  as do various state agencies 
product liability insurance the testing and sale of the company s products include an inherent risk that product liability claims may be asserted against the company 
in particular  the pharmaceutical industry has experienced increasing difficulty maintaining product liability insurance coverage at reasonable levels  and substantial increases in insurance premium costs have rendered coverage economically impractical in many cases 
the company has obtained million in product liability coverage 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims 
while the company has not experienced any product liability claims  if such claims should arise in the future  the company s business and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
employees as of april   the company employed regular full time employees 
of that total  excluding shuster  employees were involved with administrative  financial and marketing functions  were involved in technical services  were involved in processing sourcing of natural products  and were with research and development

item legal proceedings on april   an action was filed in the netherlands at the district court in the hague  against yew tree  its affiliated companies  and hauser collectively  yew tree  by bristol  a paclitaxel competitor 
the statement of claim filed by bristol alleges that the defendants  by offering and delivering yewtaxan the active substance paclitaxel manufactured by yew tree are guilty of indirect patent infringement of a european patent acquired by bristol on may  entitled products containing taxol for use in cancer therapy 
the patent was granted for countries in the european union 
bristol seeks an order to restrain yew tree from selling yewtaxan in the netherlands where the bristol patent is granted 
the company is mentioned in the action as the supplier to yew tree 
in response to the current litigation  the company has retained legal counsel in the netherlands 
after review of the bristol patent  legal counsel has concluded that infringement does not exist 
in conjunction with yew tree and its affiliates  the company intends to vigorously defend this litigation and believes that several meritorious defenses to the claims exist 
no assurance can be given that the company or yew tree will be successful in their defense 
if bristol is successful in obtaining an injunction against yew tree and the company which prohibits yew tree from selling yewtaxan  the company s sales of bulk paclitaxel to yew tree for treatment of cancer patients and the company s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
the suit may also impact the company s results of operations in terms of legal fees and costs for defending the claims and the loss of management time needed to deal with the suit

these dramatic improvements were the result of the company s efforts to rebuild its market base for paclitaxel products  increase its presence in the natural ingredients markets  and maintain its strength in providing technical services to clients 
two important contracts were secured during fiscal that helped to solidify the company s position 
first  on november   the company signed a contract with yew tree of haarlem  netherlands 
yew tree is jointly owned by the norwegian pharmaceutical company  nycomed asa and the dutch opg group 
the contract is an agreement for the company to supply gmp good manufacturing practices bulk paclitaxel for use in europe and eastern europe over a three year period 
the value of the contract is estimated to be  shipments of bulk paclitaxel to yew tree commenced during the quarter ended january  reference is made to part  item legal proceedings of this form k annual report

the research and development program  which had an initial two year term  was funded by ahp 
this program  and its associated funding  ended in may the expiration of the r d agreement did not have a material impact on the financial position or operations of the company 
the r d agreement called for the two companies to cooperate in a mutually exclusive manner in a research and development program funded by ahp which was designed to develop new products derived from naturally or synthetically produced taxanes 
during the two year term of the program  several taxanes were evaluated and submitted for in vitro pre clinical testing 
ahp had the right to review any products derived by the company from naturally or synthetically produced taxanes during the one year period after expiration of the r d agreement may  
no products have been identified for development by the parties at this time 
the company has been supplying bulk paclitaxel to ahp on a two part formula price basis which includes an initial minimum payment upon shipment of the bulk paclitaxel and a subsequent final payment  in the form of a royalty  when ahp sells finished products which contain the bulk paclitaxel 
the contract calls for certain minimum purchase requirements which are subject to variation based upon the company s production costs which are expected to result in aggregate minimum payments of approximately  during the first three years ending august  
the minimum aggregate payments are nonrefundable subject only to traditional product warranty criteria 
ahp is not required to purchase additional product after august  the supply agreement has a ten year term which can be renewed by ahp for an additional ten year period 
either company may terminate the contract upon the occurrence of uncured breaches of contract or the insolvency of the other party 
in addition  during the first five contract years  ahp can terminate the agreement in whole or in part if i the fda or a foreign regulatory agency imposes significant restrictions upon the manufacture  use or sale of bulk paclitaxel or finished product  ii the development program in foreign markets is significantly more burdensome than contemplated  iii a third party claim including a claim of patent infringement materially inhibits ahp from developing  manufacturing or selling the finished product  iv a us or european patent issues with claims which materially impact ahp s marketing activities  or v the commercial viability of the finished product deteriorates so that ahp cannot reasonably expect to profitably capture more than a designated portion of the defined taxane market 
ahp s million payment upon execution of the agreement was in exchange for the right to terminate the supply agreement within the first year under certain circumstances 
the contract also called for advance purchase payments totaling up to  contingent upon the following milestones being met the first filing of a product registration for a finished product anywhere in the world  first approval of such product registration  the first filing of such a product registration in the united kingdom  germany or france  upon approval of such foreign product registration  upon filing of such product registration with the fda and upon approval of such fda registration 
amounts otherwise payable to the company by ahp as royalties when finished products are sold will be reduced by as much as in any calendar year until such reductions aggregate advance purchase payments previously made 
the company has accounted for these advance payments as customer deposits on the balance sheet 
ahp has agreed to indemnify hauser against damages based upon use or sale of the finished product  except that the parties have agreed to share the costs of defending any patent infringement case based upon such use or sale 
during fiscal  the company sold bulk paclitaxel to ahp for its development needs  including final product formulations and clinical trials

this marked the first approval in north america for a generic form of the paclitaxel and is the first approval under the company s ten year agreement with ahp 
this approval provides the company the possibility of realizing royalty income depending upon the success of immunex s marketing efforts in canada 
management does not expect royalty income to be significant in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  ahp notified the company of its decision to maintain exclusivity of the supply of paclitaxel from hauser in the united states and canada 
in addition  ahp released its exclusive supply position in the rest of the world 
on november   the company signed a contract with yew tree to supply gmp bulk paclitaxel for use in europe and eastern europe

the european greens market  a significant portion of ironwood s customer base  became more unpredictable 
shipments of certain expected tropical greens products were delayed and  therefore  expected sales levels were not attained during this time period 
in addition  the number of competitors for raw material sourcing in the united states has increased dramatically over the past three years and  when combined with unpredictable weather patterns during the last six months  has caused higher raw material costs to the company for its greens business 
these higher raw material costs could not be passed on to the european customers as the european greens business was highly price competitive and unpredictable 
ironwood s operating results during the first and second quarters of fiscal were unacceptable and well below management s expectations  especially in light of corrective measures imposed over the past nine months
