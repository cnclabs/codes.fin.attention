shares of series c preferred stock are convertible at the option of the holder thereof into shares of common stock at the lesser of i per share or ii of a floating price equal to the average closing bid price of the common stock for the five trading days immediately proceeding the date of conversion 
the series c preferred stock is convertible  as to one third of such shares  at any time after days after the closing date  as to an additional one third of such shares  beginning days after the closing date and  as to the remaining shares  beginning days after the closing date 
all outstanding shares of series c preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock on february  the company may redeem the series c preferred stock at any time based upon a formula relating to the then applicable conversion price 
in addition  as part of such transaction  the company issued to such accredited investment funds  warrants to purchase  within five years of the date of closing  up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments from time to time 
any exercise by the company of its redemption rights  absent new financing  would adversely impact the company s liquidity 
the shares of series c preferred stock have no voting rights except as required by law and have a liquidation preference equal to their stated value 
on march  the company filed a registration statement to register certain shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of certain shares of series c preferred stock  certain shares of common stock held by certain selling stockholders named in such registration statement and certain shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain warrants 
the company has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series c preferred stock to become effective on or prior to june  on may   the company  bcbsnj and a wholly owned subsidiary of bcbsnj entered into the stockholders agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to form biometrx for the purpose of marketing the company s finger image identification technology to  among other markets  the health care industry nationwide and to certain governmental agencies in new jersey 
the company and bcbsnj have each agreed to loan up to  to biometrx for working capital purposes 
through march   the company and bcbsnj have each loaned  to biometrx to fund preliminary organizational and development activities 
as of march   biometrx has not commenced operations  and management has determined to delay commencement of activities pending further review of the applicable market requirements and demands 
biometrx intends  upon commencement of the operations thereof  to seek capital from third party investors 
there is no assurance that biometrx will commence operations or  if it commences operations  when such operations will commence and whether such operations will be successful in the marketing of any products  services or systems 
since its incorporation  the company has not paid or declared dividends on the common stock  nor does it intend to pay or declare cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
the series c preferred stock carries a dividend of per annum  which is cumulative and is payable  at the option of the company subject to certain conditions to the extent payable in shares of common stock in cash or shares of common stock  quarterly in arrears  but in no event later than the conversion date applicable to such shares of series c preferred stock 
management believes that the adequacy of its cash resources will be dependent on its ability to achieve additional sales and  to the extent necessary  obtain additional capital to complete the development and marketing of its finger imaging identification products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete significant sales of its products or services during the company continues to spend net cash at a rate of approximately  per month excluding capital expenditures for the first two months of the company believes that its existing working capital  together with cash from anticipated gross margins from operations and other funding sources  including the possibile sale of capital stock  will be sufficient to meet its expected working capital needs for at least the next twelve months assuming revenues for are at least equal to the revenues realized in however  absent a significant increase in sales  the company will require additional funds thereafter to continue  among other things  development  testing and marketing of its finger imaging identification products and services and to maintain its operations 
there is a significant likelihood that such additional funds will not be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
it is likely that any such additional infusion of capital would be in the form of the sale and issuance of additional shares of common stock  which may substantially increase the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis 
the failure to obtain such additional funds may cause the company to cease or curtail operations 
even if such additional funding is obtained  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the developing and testing of its products and services or  if completed  that it will be able to consummate significant sales of its products or services
