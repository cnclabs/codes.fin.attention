establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps and applies to entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock 
this statement simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share previously found in apb opinion  earnings per share  and makes them comparable to international eps standards

basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps pursuant to opinion this statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods  earlier application is not permitted
