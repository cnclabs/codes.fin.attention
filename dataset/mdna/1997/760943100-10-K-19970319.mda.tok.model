item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview res care receives revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  educational and support services to populations with special needs  including persons with developmental and other disabilities disabilities services and at risk and troubled youths youth services 
revenues for the company s disabilities services operations are derived primarily from state government agencies under the medicaid reimbursement system and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid system 
reimbursement methods vary by state and are typically based on a flat rate or cost based reimbursement system on a per person  per diem basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based primarily upon historical costs experienced by the company and by other service providers  and inflation 
at facilities and programs where it is the provider of record  the company is directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services it provides and such reimbursement is affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that the company operates pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated based upon the reimbursement amount expected to be earned by the provider of record  which is affected by occupancy levels 
under certain management contracts  the company is paid a fixed fee regardless of occupancy levels 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies with respect to medicaid contracts 
the company s youth services operations include seven vocational training programs under the federal job corps program administered by the dol 
under the job corps program  the company is reimbursed for direct costs related to job corps center operations and allowable indirect costs for general and administrative expenses  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a fixed percentage of facility and program expenses 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program expenses 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
in july  the company began operating various programs for at risk and troubled youths through its youthtrack subsidiary  of which is owned by youthtrack s management  and the company s wholly owned alternative youth services subsidiary 
most of the youth services programs are funded directly by federal  state and local government agencies 
under these contracts  the company is typically reimbursed based on fixed contract amounts  flat rates or cost based rates 
the effect of youthtrack management s ownership interest is reflected in the company s consolidated statement of income as a minority interest 
expenses incurred under federal  state and local government agency contracts for disabilities services and youth services  as well as management contracts with providers of record for such agencies  are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
any resulting adjustments would be recorded as contractual adjustments to revenues in the period in which the adjustment is made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s revenues and net income fluctuate from quarter to quarter  in part because annual medicaid rate adjustments have been announced inconsistently and are usually retroactive to the beginning of the particular state s fiscal reporting period 
the company expects that future adjustments in reimbursement rates in most states will consist primarily of cost of living adjustments 
however  in some cases states have revised their rate setting methodologies which has resulted in rate decreases as well as rate increases 
current initiatives at the federal or state level may materially change the medicaid system as it now exists 
retroactively calculated contractual adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the periods the related services are rendered and recorded as adjustments to revenues in future periods as final settlements are determined 
because the cumulative effect of rate adjustments may differ from previously estimated amounts  net income as a percentage of net revenues for a period in which an adjustment occurs may not be indicative of expected results in succeeding periods 
revenues in the future may be affected by changes in rate setting structures  methodologies or interpretations that may be proposed or are under consideration in states where the company operates 
also  some states have considered initiating managed care plans for persons currently in medicaid programs 
at this time  the company cannot determine the impact of such changes  or the effect of various federal initiatives that have been proposed 
the company is currently engaged in litigation or administrative proceedings with several state medicaid programs regarding rate setting and reimbursement methodologies which  if adversely determined  could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  especially in any period in which such adjustments exceed amounts previously estimated 
see business legal proceedings

the company generally prefers to provide its services under management contracts or in facilities that are leased  which minimizes the amount of capital expenditures required

also  acquisitions may involve significant capital expenditures 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures for its current facilities  although the company maintains an ongoing capital improvements program 
risks associated with forward looking statements in response to the safe harbor provisions contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is including the following cautionary statements that are intended to identify certain important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements concerning the company made by or on behalf of the company  whether contained herein or elsewhere 
the company s growth in revenues and earnings per share has been directly related to a considerable increase in the number of individuals served in its division for persons with disabilities and its division for youth services 
this growth is largely dependent upon development driven activities  including the acquisitions of other businesses or facilities or of management contract rights to operate facilities  the award of contracts to open new facilities or start new operations or to assume management of facilities previously operated by governmental agencies or not for profit organizations and the extension or renewal of contracts previously awarded to the company 
the company often makes forward looking statements regarding its development activities 
changes in the company s future revenues depend significantly upon the success of these development activities  and in particular on the company s ability to obtain additional contracts to provide services to the consumer bases it serves  whether through acquisitions  awards in response to requests for proposals for new facilities or programs or for facilities being privatized by governmental agencies  or other development activities 
future revenues also depend on the company s ability to maintain and renew its existing services contracts and its existing leases 
the company actively seeks acquisitions of other companies  facilities and other assets as a means of increasing the number of consumers served  and changes in the market for such acquisition prospects  including increasing competition for and increasing pricing of such acquisition prospects  could also adversely affect the timing and or viability of future development activities 
revenues of the company s division for persons with disabilities are highly dependent on reimbursement under federal and state medicaid programs 
generally  each state has its own medicaid reimbursement regulations and formula 
the company s revenues and operating profitability are dependent upon the company s ability to maintain its existing reimbursement levels and to obtain periodic increases in reimbursement rates 
changes in the manner in which medicaid reimbursement rates are established in one or more of the states in which the company conducts its operations  such as those recently encountered by the company  could adversely affect revenues and profitability 
other changes in the manner in which federal and state reimbursement programs are operated  and in the manner in which billings costs are reviewed and audited  could also affect revenues and operating profitability 
the company s cost structure and ultimate operating profitability are significantly dependent on its labor costs and the availability and utilization of its labor force and thus may be affected by a variety of factors  including local competitive forces  changes in minimum wages or other direct personnel costs  the company s effectiveness in managing its direct service staff  and changes in consumer services models  such as the trends toward supported living and managed care 
additionally  the company s continued expansion of its existing operations  and its ability to expand into providing services to other populations utilizing the company s core competencies are dependent upon continuation of trends toward downsizing  privatization and consolidation  the company s ability to tailor its services to meet the specific needs of these different populations  and its success in operating in a changing reimbursement environment 
the continuation of such trends and the nature of its operating environment are subject to a variety of political  economic  social and legal pressures  including desires of governmental agencies to reduce costs and increase levels of services  federal  state and local budgetary constraints and actions brought by advocacy groups and the courts to change existing service delivery systems 
material changes resulting from these trends and pressures could adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement of the company s services and its operating flexibility  and ultimately its revenues and profitability
