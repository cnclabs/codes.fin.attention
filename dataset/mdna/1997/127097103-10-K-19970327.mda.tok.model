the proved reserve estimates presented herein were prepared by the company s petroleum engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents  ltd  independent petroleum engineers 
for additional information regarding the company s estimates of proved reserves  the review of such estimates by miller and lents  ltd 
and certain other information regarding the company s oil and gas reserves  see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
a copy of the review letter by miller and lents  ltd  has been filed as an exhibit to this form k 
the company s estimates of proved reserves set forth in the foregoing table do not differ materially from those filed by the company with other federal agencies 
the company s reserves are sensitive to natural gas sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates 
the company s reserves are based on oil and gas prices in effect at december  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond the control of the company and  therefore  the reserve information set forth in this form k represents only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
as a result  estimates of different engineers often vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties owned by the company declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent the company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities or both  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced

competition competition in the company s primary producing areas is intense 
the company believes that its competitive position is affected by price  contract terms and quality of service  including pipeline connection times  distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record 
the company believes that its extensive acreage position and existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage fields give it a competitive advantage over certain other producers in the appalachian region which do not have such systems or facilities in place 
the company also believes that its competitive position in the appalachian region is enhanced by the absence of significant competition from major oil and gas companies 
the company also actively competes against some companies with substantially larger financial and other resources  particularly in the western region 
other business matters major customer the company had no sales to any customer that exceeded of the company s total gross revenues in seasonality demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal in nature  with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 
regulation of oil and natural gas production the company s oil and gas production and transportation operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
further  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  have issued rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members  compliance with which is often difficult and costly and some of which may carry substantial penalties for non compliance 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and  consequently  affects its profitability 
inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently expanded  amended or reinterpreted  the company is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
however  the company does not believe that under present regulations it is affected in a significantly different manner by these regulations than others in the industry 
exploration and production exploration and production operations of the company are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
the company s operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates or production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
in this regard  such states as texas  oklahoma and louisiana have in recent years reviewed and substantially revised methods previously used to gather the necessary information and make monthly determinations of appropriate field and well allowables 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas the company can produce from its wells  and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which the company can drill 
natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas produced by the company and the manner in which such production is marketed 
the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc regulates the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas by interstate and intrastate pipelines 
the ferc previously regulated the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in first sales in interstate and intrastate commerce under the natural gas policy act 
effective january   however  the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas  which includes all sales by the company of its own production 
as a result  all sales of the company s domestically produced natural gas may be sold at market prices  unless otherwise committed by contract 
the ferc s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation was unaffected by the decontrol act 
the company s natural gas sales are affected by the regulation of intrastate and interstate gas transportation 
in an attempt to restructure the interstate pipeline industry with the goal of providing enhanced access to  and competition among  alternative natural gas suppliers  the ferc  commencing in april  issued order nos 
 a and b order no 
which have altered significantly the interstate transportation and sale of natural gas 
among other things  order no 
required pipelines to unbundle the various services that they had provided in the past  such as sales  transmission and storage  and to offer these services individually to their customers 
by requiring interstate pipelines to unbundle their services and to provide their customers with direct access to pipeline capacity held by them  order no 
has enabled pipeline customers to choose the levels of transportation and storage service they require  as well as to purchase natural gas directly from third party merchants other than the pipelines and obtain transportation of such gas on a nondiscriminatory basis 
the effect of order no 
has been to enable the company to market its natural gas production to a wider variety of potential purchasers 
the company believes that these changes generally have improved the company s access to transportation and have enhanced the marketability of its natural gas production 
to date  order no 
has not had any material adverse effect on the company s ability to market and transport its natural gas production 
however  even though order no 
has been affirmed on appeal  with minor exceptions  and most individual pipelines have final open access tariffs now in place  the ferc is continuing to review and assess the effectiveness of it regulations and the company cannot predict what new regulations may be adopted by the ferc and other regulatory authorities  or what effect subsequent regulations may have on the company s activities 
in recent years the ferc also has pursued a number of other important policy initiatives which could significantly affect the marketing of natural gas 
some of the more notable of these regulatory initiatives include i a series of orders in individual pipeline proceedings articulating a policy of generally approving the voluntary divestiture of interstate pipeline owned gathering facilities either to non affiliated companies a spin off or to the pipeline s nonregulated affiliate a spin down  ii the completion of a rulemaking proceeding involving the regulation of pipelines with marketing affiliates under order no 
 iii ferc s ongoing efforts to promulgate standards for pipeline electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange  iv a generic inquiry into the pricing of interstate pipeline capacity  v efforts to refine ferc s regulations controlling the operation of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity  vi a policy statement regarding market based rates and other non cost based rates for interstate pipeline transmission and storage capacity and vii appropriate ratemaking procedures for pipeline expansions and extensions 
several of these initiatives are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets  although some  such as the so called spin down of previously regulated gathering facilities by interstate pipelines to their affiliates  may have the adverse effect on some in the industry of increasing the cost of doing business as a result of the monopolization of those facilities by their new  unregulated owners 
ferc attempted to address some of these concerns in its orders authorizing such spin downs  but one of its principal devices  the use of default contracts to assure continuity of gathering services for two years after spin down  was found unlawful on appeal and it remains to be seen what effect the ferc s other activities will have on access to markets and the cost to do business 
in response to the ferc s policy of authorizing the interstate pipeline industry s divestiture of these gathering facilities  several states most notably oklahoma and texas have enacted or are considering laws and regulations enhancing state level oversight over gathering 
as to all of these recent ferc and state initiatives  the ongoing  or  in some instances  preliminary evolving nature of these regulatory initiatives makes it impossible at this time to predict their ultimate impact upon the company s activities 
the company s pipeline systems and storage fields are regulated for safety compliance by the department of transportation  the west virginia public service commission  the pennsylvania department of natural resources and the new york department of public service 
the company s pipeline systems in each state operate independently and are not interconnected 
environmental regulations general 
the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
permits are required for the operation of various facilities of the company  and these permits are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by issuing authorities 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations  and violations are subject to fines  injunctions or both 
such government regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  installing and operating oil and gas facilities 
in most instances  the regulatory requirements impose water and air pollution control measures 
although the company believes that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company  risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in oil and gas production operations  and no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as stricter environmental laws and regulations  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production would result in substantial costs and liabilities to the company 
solid and hazardous waste 
the company currently owns or leases  and has in the past owned or leased  numerous properties that have been used for production of oil and gas for many years 
although the company has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the company 
in addition  many of the properties have been operated by third parties 
the company had no control over such parties treatment of hydrocarbons or other solid wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed or released 
state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under these new laws  the company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
the company generates some wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes 
furthermore  it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statues  and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
superfund 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons with respect to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance found at a site 
cercla also authorizes the epa  and in some cases  third parties  to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible parties the costs of such action 
in the course of the company s operations  the company has generated and will generate wastes that may fall within cercla s definition of hazardous substances 
the company may also be an owner of sites on which hazardous substances have been released 
therefore  the company may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
oil pollution act 
the oil pollution act of the opa and regulations thereunder impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland waste bodies  including wetlands and intermittent streams 
the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
air emissions 
the operations of the company are subject to local  state and federal laws and regulations for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies 
alternatively  regulatory agencies could require the company to cease construction or operation of certain air emission sources 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with the emission standards under local  state and federal laws and regulations 
employees the company had active employees as of december  the company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory 
the company has not entered into any collective bargaining agreements with its employees 
other the company s profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond its control  such as natural gas and crude oil prices 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves a variety of risks  including the risk of experiencing certain operating hazards such as fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering  oil spills and encountering formations with abnormal pressures  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company 
the operation of the company s natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves certain risks  including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures 
the proximity of pipelines to populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could exacerbate such risks 
at december   the company owned or operated approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems 
as part of its normal maintenance program  the company has identified certain segments of its pipelines which it believes require repair  replacement or additional maintenance 
in accordance with customary industry practices  the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of such risks 
item properties see item business 
item legal proceedings the company and its subsidiaries are defendants or parties in numerous lawsuits or other governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company is also involved in other gas contract issues 
in the opinion of the company  final judgements or settlements  if any  which may be awarded in connection with any one or more of these suits and claims could be significant to the results of operations and cash flows of any period but would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
on february   washington energy company and puget sound power light company merged to form puget sound energy  inc puget 
as a result of the merger  puget is the holder of  shares of common stock and  shares of the company s convertible redeemable preferred stock convertible into  shares of common stock  all of which were previously held by washington energy company 
mr 
william p 
vititoe  a member of the company s board of directors  is a consultant to puget and was formerly an officer and director of washington energy company 
the company sells approximately of its natural gas production in the western region to a cogeneration plant located in bellingham  washington and owned by encogen northwest  lp encogen under a gas sales contract containing a fixed price that escalates annually  a firm delivery arrangement and a term continuing through june  encogen sells all the electrical power generated in the plant to puget under an agreement for firm power purchase power agreement 
the company is aware that a dispute has arisen between puget and encogen over the appropriate interpretation of certain provisions of the power agreement  which dispute is currently being litigated 
puget has requested the court  among other matters  to declare that encogen is in material breach of the power agreement 
a finding by the court that encogen is in material breach of the power agreement could lead to termination of the power agreement 
any restructuring or termination of the power agreement may have a negative impact on the company s gas sales arrangement with encogen 
encogen has requested that the company consider restructuring its gas sales arrangement with encogen 
to date the company has been unwilling to restructure its gas sales agreement without being fully compensated for the agreement s value

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere 
overview the substantial up swing in gas prices  coupled with actions taken in designed to return the company to long term profitability  played an important part in the company s performance in with record earnings and operating cash flows 
operating results for included the benefit of the following realizations o the average produced natural gas price was per mcf  up compared to o as a result of the improved pricing environment  margins on brokered natural gas sales increased  or million over o under its continued program to divest non strategic properties  the company sold wells located in the appalachian region  generating million in cash proceeds and a gain on sale of million 
o net interest costs were down million  or  primarily due to the absence of interest rate swaps that were in place in  lower interest rates  a reduced debt balance and million of interest income related to an income tax refund for tax periods prior to o depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expenses were down million or per mcfe of production 
this reduction was primarily the result of the impairment of long lived assets recorded as a result of adopting sfas in september  which reduced the depreciable basis of properties and equipment by million 
operating cash flows reached a record level  increasing million  or  over cash flows from operations  along with the million of proceeds from the sale of non strategic properties  predominantly funded million of capital and exploration expenditures  million higher than  and million of preferred and common stock dividend payments 
the company drilled net wells with a net success rate of compared to net wells and a net success rate in along with the higher success rate in  the company replaced of production  through drilling additions and revisions  versus production replacement in in the company plans to drill wells and spend million in capital and exploration expenditures  higher than expenditures 
natural gas production equivalent was bcf  virtually unchanged compared to the production from new wells reversed the downward trend in production experienced in the early part of due to the low level of development activity in  drilling only net wells compared to an average of net wells per year over the previous five years  and the sale of non strategic properties  representing quarterly production of bcf 
the company had a number of gas price swaps in place to hedge a significant portion of its production for the first four months of for the remainder of  the company had one small hedge contract for the months of may through september in a notional quantity equal to  mmbtu per day  or less than of the company s daily production 
while the company will selectively use gas price hedges from time to time to protect certain markets when substantial downside risks are perceived  management intends to structure the hedge positions in a manner that retains upside potential 
the company s strategic pursuits are sensitive to energy commodity prices  particularly the price of natural gas 
while gas prices in many regions of the us moved up sharply in november and december of to near record levels and some industry analysts predict continued improvements in pricing over  the gas market has demonstrated significant price volatility during the months of january  february  and march consequently  there is considerable uncertainty about gas prices for the rest of and beyond 
the company remains focused on the following goals established in  applying a three pronged strategy of growth through the drill bit  growth through synergistic acquisitions and growth through greater emphasis on marketing 
the company believes that progress toward these goals is appropriate in the current industry environment  enabling the company to effectively achieve its strategy over the long term 
o increase cash flows  using a balance of increased production and reduced costs 
significant progress has been made toward this goal  and the company expects to be profitable in if the henry hub average price for the full year is or more  assuming a traditional correlation between henry hub prices and prices realized by the company in its regional markets 
o maintain reserves per share while increasing production to protect long term shareholder value 
an aggressive drilling program is designed to result in production exceeding  and reserves are also expected to increase 
o reduce debt as a percentage of total capitalization without diluting existing shareholder value 
to achieve this goal  project returns will be compared with the marginal cost of debt when deciding whether to reinvest or pay down debt 
other financing alternatives will also be reviewed 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing the company s strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
see forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity the company s capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from its oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by its oil and gas reserves 
the company s level of earnings and cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and natural gas and its ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for oil and gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
natural gas prices and demand were up significantly in over  resulting in higher cash flows 
the primary source of cash for the company during was from funds generated from operations 
primary uses of cash were funds used in operations  exploration and development expenditures  acquisitions  dividends on preferred and common stock and repayment of debt 
the company had a net cash outflow of million in net cash inflow from operating and financing activities totalled million  funding in most part the capital and exploration expenditures of million  net of the million in proceeds from the sale of assets 
in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were substantially higher  increasing million over  due predominantly to higher natural gas prices 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were lower by million compared with primarily due to lower gas prices and higher interest costs attributable to the and acquisitions 
in millions cash flows provided used by investing activities cash flows used by investing activities in were million higher than in due primarily to million of increased capital and exploration expenditures over the company s drilling program was scaled down  drilling only net wells  compared to an average of net wells per year over the previous five years 
the capital expenditures were offset in part by proceeds of million from the sale of assets 
cash flows used by investing activities in were million lower than in due primarily to a million decrease in capital expenditures and the lack of a major acquisition in compared to the million capital outlay for the werco acquisition in the capital expenditures were offset in part by proceeds of million for a valuation adjustment on the werco acquisition and million in proceeds from the sale of assets 
in millions cash flows provided used by financing activities cash flows provided used by financing activities from to were primarily borrowings from or payments on the company s revolving credit facility while in most of the activity was dividend payments 
in and the company reduced its debt under this facility by million and million  respectively 
in the company s debt under this facility increased million  including million to partially fund the werco acquisition  million to purchase additional drilling locations in connection with the acquisition of proved properties from emax oil company emax  and million for other property acquisitions and capital expenditures 
since june  the company s available credit line under the revolving credit facility has been million 
the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the projected present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by an independent petroleum engineer s report incorporating certain assumptions provided by the lender and other assets 
the company s outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility was million at december  the company s interest expense is projected to be approximately million 
no principal payments are due in capitalization information on the company is as follows in millions long term debt stockholders equity common stock preferred stock total total capitalization debt to capitalization the company s capitalization reflects the non cash impact to equity of the million sfas impairment of long lived assets recorded in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
capital and exploration expenditures the following table presents major components of capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions werco acquisition exploration expenses total an adjustment to the million non cash component relating to deferred taxes for the difference between the tax and book bases of the acquired properties  as required by sfas  accounting for income taxes  of the werco acquisition as a result of the million valuation adjustment received in a net cash payment received in connection with a valuation adjustment on the werco acquisition 
included in capital expenditures for the werco acquisition was million in common and preferred stock of the company and a million non cash component described in note 
the substantial reduction in capital and exploration expenditures in resulted from the downsized capital expenditures program resulting from depressed gas prices and the absence of a major acquisition 
the company generally funds its capital and exploration activities  excluding oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and budgets such capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows  exclusive of acquisitions 
planned expenditures for have been increased compared with depending on the level of future natural gas prices  the company intends to review and adjust the capital and exploration expenditures planned for as industry conditions dictate 
presently  the company projects million in capital and exploration expenditures for the company plans to drill wells net  compared with wells net drilled in capital dedicated to the drilling program for is million 
in addition to the drilling program  other capital expenditures are planned primarily for producing property acquisitions and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction 
during  dividends were paid on the company s common stock totaling million  on the convertible preferred stock totaling million  and on the convertible redeemable preferred stock totaling million 
the company has paid quarterly common stock dividends of per share since becoming publicly traded in the amount of future dividends is determined by the board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition  and capital requirements

the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale is approximately per mmbtu in in and  the company completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in and approximately million over the remaining six years see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company has benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference cannot reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
the company s operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
the company s ability to incur debt  to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock  and to make certain types of investments is dependent upon certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  the company s revolving credit facility specifies a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december  the calculated ratio for was to conclusion the company s financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and its ability to market its production on economically attractive terms 
the company s average produced natural gas sales price increased compared to and is the predominant reason for its record earnings and operating cash flow performance since becoming a public company in while prices in most regions of the us moved up sharply in november and december  price volatility in the gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years  as demonstrated most recently in the first two months of with wide price swings in day to day trading on the nymex futures market 
given this continued price volatility  management cannot predict with certainty what pricing levels will be for the rest of and beyond 
because future cash flows and earnings are subject to such variables  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund its capital requirements if prices should return to the depressed levels of while the company s plans include an increase in capital spending  potentially negative changes in industry conditions might require the company to adjust its spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of its capital requirements  including  among other things  reductions in capital expenditures or common stock dividends 
the company believes its capital resources  supplemented  if necessary  with external financing  are adequate to meet its capital requirements

natural gas sales comprised  or million  of net operating revenue in the increase in net operating revenues was driven primarily by a increase in the produced natural gas sales price 
net income loss and operating income loss  excluding selected items  were similarly impacted by the increase in the produced natural gas sales price  as well as lower depreciation  depletion amortization and interest expenses 
natural gas production volumes were down bcf  or  to bcf in the appalachian region  a result from the low level of drilling activity in and the sale of non strategic properties 
natural gas production volumes were up bcf  or  to bcf in the western region due primarily to rocky mountains and gulf coast area wells drilled and put on line in the second and third quarters of the average appalachian natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing net operating revenues by approximately million on bcf of production 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing net operating revenues by approximately million on bcf of production 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to 
crude oil and condensate sales decreased mbbl  or  due primarily to the low drilling activity in and the sale of various non strategic oil properties in brokered natural gas margin was up million to million due primarily to a per mcf increase in the net margin to per mcf  a result of the higher prices environment in brokered volume was comparable to operating expenses 
total operating expenses  excluding the selected items  were virtually unchanged  increasing million 
the significant changes are explained as follows o exploration expense increased million due to the million increase in dry hole expense and the million increase in geological and geophysical expenses  a direct result of the increased capital expenditure program in o depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense decreased million  or  due to a per mcfe decline in the dd a rate caused by the impairment of long lived assets which reduced depreciable basis by million

natural gas production revenues comprised  or million  of total net operating revenues in the decrease in total net operating revenues was driven primarily by a decrease in the average produced natural gas sales price  and in part by a increase in natural gas production volumes due to higher gas purchased for resale up as discussed below 
net income loss and operating income loss  excluding selected items  were similarly impacted by the decline in the average natural gas price  as well as higher financing costs in connection with the werco and emax acquisitions 
natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down bcf  or  to bcf due in part to higher pipeline curtailments and normal production declines not fully replaced by new production due primarily to reduced drilling activity in natural gas production volumes were up bcf to bcf in the western region due primarily to a full year of operating results from the werco acquisition 
the average appalachian natural gas production sales price decreased per mcf  or  to  decreasing net operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price decreased per mcf  or  to  decreasing net operating revenues by approximately million 
because the proportion of lower priced western region production sales volume relative to total company production sales volume was up significantly  the weighted average natural gas production sales price for the total company decreased per mcf  or  to 
crude oil and condensate sales were virtually unchanged at mbbl 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses  excluding the selected items  decreased million  or  due primarily to the following o the costs of natural gas decreased million to million
