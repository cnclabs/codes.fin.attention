item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general keystone is a leading manufacturer of fabricated wire products  industrial wire and carbon steel rod for the agricultural  industrial  construction  original equipment manufacturer and retail consumer markets 
the company s operations benefit from vertical integration as the company s mini mill supplies carbon steel rod produced from scrap metal to its downstream fabricated wire products and industrial wire operations 
these downstream fabrication operations accounted for of net sales 
the company believes it is the second largest manufacturer of fabricated wire products and industrial wire in the united states based on tons produced  in  substantially all of which is converted from rod produced by the company 
the company s fabricated wire products typically yield higher and less volatile gross margins compared to rod 
the company s estimated current fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity is  tons 
utilization of the company s annual fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity aggregated in  in and in recent modifications to the company s steel making operations increased annual billet production capacity from approximately  tons to  tons  while the current estimated annual production capacity of the company s rod mill is approximately  tons 
in and the company s steel making operations operated at near capacity and  together with billet purchases of  tons and  tons in and  respectively  provided  tons and  tons of billets in and  respectively 
despite comparable billet volumes  rod production increased from  tons of estimated capacity in to  tons of estimated capacity in due primarily to decreases in year to year billet inventory levels and  tons of billets that were converted to rod in for another manufacturer 
rod production in was also adversely impacted by power curtailments and outages under the company s interruptible power supply agreement  and the related impact on manufacturing efficiency 
in november  the company entered into a joint venture agreement and formed ewp 
the company has a equity interest in ewp together with an option to acquire the remaining 
in  the company contributed to ewp  among other things  certain equipment as part of its capital contribution 
as a result  the company no longer sells most of the fabricated wire products previously manufactured on the equipment contributed to ewp 
during  the company manufactured  tons of these fabricated wire products as compared to  tons in however  as part of the joint venture agreement  the company supplies ewp with all of its rod requirements 
during  the company shipped  tons of rod to ewp as compared to  tons in the company s profitability is dependent in large part on its ability to utilize effectively its production capacity  which is affected by the availability of raw material  plant efficiency and other production factors  and control its manufacturing costs  which are comprised primarily of raw materials  energy and labor costs 
the company s primary raw material is scrap steel 
the price of scrap steel is highly volatile and scrap steel prices are affected by periodic shortages  freight costs  weather and other conditions largely beyond the control of the company 
although the average per ton price paid for scrap by the company was relatively constant during  and  and  respectively  prices can vary widely from period to period and the product selling prices cannot always be adjusted  especially in the short term  to recover the costs of large increases in scrap prices 
the company consumes a significant amount of energy in its manufacturing operations and  accordingly  its profitability can also be adversely affected by the volatility in the price of coal  oil and natural gas resulting in increased energy  transportation  freight  scrap and supply costs 
the company purchases electrical energy for its peoria  illinois facility from a regulated utility under an interruptible service contract which provides for more economical electricity rates but allows the utility to refuse or interrupt power to the company s manufacturing facilities during periods of peak demand 
the utility has in the past refused or interrupted service to the company resulting in decreased production and higher costs associated with the related downtime 
as a result of the acquisition of desoto in september  the company is also engaged in the manufacture and packaging of household cleaning products 
as the operations of desoto were insignificant when compared to the consolidated operations of the company in and are expected to continue to be insignificant in the future  desoto s results of operations are not separately addressed in the discussion that follows 
the statements in this annual report on form k relating to matters that are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements found in item business and item legal proceedings  and in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  cost of raw materials  future supply and demand for the company s products including cyclicality thereof  general economic conditions  competitive products and substitute products  customer and competitor strategies  the impact of pricing and production decisions  environmental matters  government regulations and possible changes therein  and the ultimate resolution of pending litigation and possible future litigation as discussed in this annual report  including  without limitation  the sections referenced above 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data of the company as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expense operating income income before income taxes provision for income taxes 

net income from continuing operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased to million in from million in of these sales  fabricated wire products represented million in and million in  industrial wire represented million in and million in  and carbon steel rod represented million in and million in fabricated wire product prices increased approximately while shipments decreased to  tons in from  in this decrease in shipments was primarily due to the closing of the company s west coast distribution facility and the contribution of certain equipment to the ewp joint venture in  as discussed previously 
shipments of fabricated wire products by keystone s remaining facilities increased slightly in but were more than offset by the decline of  tons of fabricated wire products due to the closure of the west coast distribution facility in industrial wire prices decreased approximately in while shipments also decreased from to  tons in from  tons in 
carbon steel rod prices decreased as shipments increased from to  tons in from  tons in 
this increase in rod shipments was due in part to increased purchases by ewp 
gross profit increased approximately to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in  as lower overall product per ton selling prices were more than offset by a more favorable product sales mix of fabricated wire products  lower scrap and purchased billet costs and lower pension expense 
during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to purchases of  tons at an average price of per ton 
the company purchased  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons at per ton in the desoto acquisition in september included the simultaneous merger of the company s and desoto s defined benefit pension plans and  as a result  pension expense decreased in  as compared to during and the company charged pension expense of approximately million and million  respectively  to cost of goods sold 
the company currently estimates  for financial reporting purposes  that it will recognize a non cash pension credit of approximately million in and  does not anticipate cash contributions for defined benefit pension plan fundings will be required in however  future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases in pension expense or credit and future funding requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling expenses decreased to million in from million in but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  in this increase was primarily a result of higher expenses related to the company s environmental remediation project at its peoria  illinois facility million in as compared to million in  increased insurance costs due to abnormally low levels in and costs incurred in connection with a possible joint venture that  upon termination of discussions with the potential joint venture partner  were charged to expense in at december   the company s financial statements reflected total accrued liabilities of million to cover estimated remediation costs arising from environmental issues 
although the company has established an accrual for estimated future required environmental remediation costs  there is no assurance regarding the ultimate cost of remedial measures that might eventually be required by environmental authorities or that additional environmental hazards  requiring further remedial expenditures  might not be asserted by such authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts accrued 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in was higher than due principally to higher average borrowing levels primarily due to decreased profitability in as well as payments made in connection with the desoto acquisition 
average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facility and term loan approximated million in as compared to million in during  the average interest rate paid by the company was per annum as compared to per annum in the company expects higher average borrowing levels and interest rates in will result in increased interest expense as compared to the level 
the principal reasons for the difference between the us federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s deferred tax position at december  is also explained in note to the consolidated financial statements and in liquidity and capital resources 
the effective tax rates were comparable between and as a result of the items discussed above  net income during decreased to million from million in  or approximately  and decreased as a percentage of sales to from 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased to million in from million in of these sales  fabricated wire products represented million in and million in  industrial wire represented million in and million in  and carbon steel rod represented million in and million in in  fabricated wire product prices increased approximately over levels  but shipments decreased  tons in from  tons in 
the  ton decrease in sales of fabricated wire products in as compared to was due primarily to a  ton decrease in shipments from the west coast distribution facility that was eventually closed in late and an  ton decrease in the products manufactured on the equipment that was contributed to ewp in industrial wire prices increased in as shipments decreased  tons in from  in 
carbon steel rod prices also increased approximately in as shipments decreased  tons in as compared to  in 
gross profit decreased approximately to million in from million in gross profit margin fell to in from in  due to increased scrap costs  increased rod conversion costs and increased costs resulting from production delays due to power refusals and interruptions and unplanned equipment repairs 
during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons at an average price of per ton in rod conversion costs in increased to per ton as compared to costs of per ton 
during and  the company charged pension expense of approximately million and million  respectively  to cost of goods sold 
selling expenses decreased to million in from million in but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses declined  or million  from to this decline was primarily a result of lower expenses related to the company s information systems project  environmental remediation and disposal of contaminated electric arc furnace dust 
during  expenses related to the company s environmental remediation efforts and disposal of contaminated electric arc furnace dust amounted to million as compared to expenses of million 
interest expense related to the company s various credit facilities in was higher than due principally to higher average interest rates and borrowing levels 
during  the average interest rate paid by the company was per annum as compared to per annum in average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facility and term loan approximated million in as compared to million in during  the company accrued approximately million for the estimated interest cost as a result of an unfavorable u 
s 
supreme court decision related to the company s and contributions of certain real property to its pension plans 
in  pursuant to the terms of an agreement with the internal revenue service  the interest due was reduced to approximately  and  as such  the company recorded a reduction of approximately million in the previously accrued interest 
the effective tax rates were comparable between and as a result of the items discussed above  net income during decreased to million from million in  or 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million  including million of notes payable and current maturities of long term debt 
the outstanding borrowings under the company s million revolving credit facility were million at december  the amount of available borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility is based on formula determined amounts of trade receivables and inventories  less the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
additional available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which expires december   were million at december  the company s revolving credit facility requires daily cash receipts to be used to reduce outstanding borrowings  which results in the company maintaining zero cash balances 
the company had net deferred tax assets of million at december   million of which are classified as current assets 
the majority of the deferred tax asset relates to expenses accrued for financial reporting purposes but not yet paid or deductible for income tax purposes  and alternative minimum tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
the company continually monitors and evaluates the need for  and amount of  a deferred tax valuation allowance and will in the future  after considering all factors believed to be relevant  make appropriate adjustments  if any  to such allowance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the company s operating activities used approximately 
million of cash  compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in in addition to lower earnings in as compared to  cash flow from operations was impacted by changes in relative levels of assets and liabilities  including levels of pension fundings in excess of pension expense 
defined benefit pension plan contributions million exceeded pension expense million by approximately million in the acquisition of desoto included the simultaneous merger of keystone s previously underfunded defined benefit pension plans with and into desoto s overfunded defined benefit pension plan  resulting in a single overfunded plan for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  the company does not expect to be required to make contributions to the pension plan during future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases to pension expense or credit and funding requirements in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
immediately following the acquisition of desoto  keystone was obligated to cause desoto to pay approximately million to certain of desoto s trade creditors the trade credit group and million of accumulated  unpaid dividends to the former holders of desoto s preferred stock 
in addition  desoto was required to pay an additional million  plus interest at to the trade credit group before september   which amounts were paid by desoto in february prior to its acquisition by keystone  desoto received a report of tax examination changes from the internal revenue service irs that proposes adjustments resulting in additional taxes due of million and penalties of million  as well as an unspecified amount of interest for the years through desoto has filed a formal appeal of the proposed adjustments 
the timing of payments required to settle any amounts ultimately due could have a significant impact on the company s cash flows 
during  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million primarily related to upgrades of production equipment and an information systems project at its facility in peoria  illinois 
capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be approximately million and are related primarily to upgrades of production equipment 
the company incurs significant ongoing costs for plant and equipment and substantial employee medical benefits for both current and retired employees 
as such  the company is vulnerable to business downturns and increases in costs  and accordingly  routinely compares its liquidity requirements and capital needs against its estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past  and may in the future  reduce controllable costs  modify product mix  acquire and dispose of businesses  restructure certain indebtedness  and raise additional equity capital 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for similar actions or other measures in the future in order to meet its obligations 
the company also routinely evaluates acquisitions of interests in  or combinations with  companies related to the company s current businesses 
the company intends to consider such acquisition activities in the future and  in connection with this activity  may consider issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company 
management believes the cash flows from operations together with the funds available under its revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet its anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs for the year ending december  this belief is based upon management s assessment of various financial and operational factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions relating to product shipments  product mix and selling prices  production schedules  productivity rates  raw materials  electricity  labor  employee benefits and other fixed and variable costs  working capital requirements  interest rates  repayments of long term debt  capital expenditures  and available borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
however  liabilities under environmental laws and regulations with respect to the clean up and disposal of wastes  any significant increases in the cost of providing medical coverage to active and retired employees or an unfavorable result of desoto s irs examination  could have a material adverse effect on the future liquidity  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
additionally  significant declines in the company s end user markets or market share  the inability to maintain satisfactory billet and rod production levels  or other unanticipated costs  if significant  could result in a need for funds greater than the company currently has available 
there can be no assurance the company would be able to obtain an adequate amount of additional financing
