item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company has changed its fiscal year to end on september  this has resulted in an eleven month reporting period ended september  included in this transition report on form k 
prior to this change the company s fiscal year ended on october the company is a provider of a broad range of home health care services and products with operations in the us and the us the company provides the following services and products to patients in their homes i specialty mail order pharmaceuticals  medical supplies  respiratory therapy and home medical equipment  ii patient services  including home nursing and para professional services  and iii infusion therapy 
the company s us patient  infusion and respiratory therapy services and home medical equipment operations are concentrated in new jersey  new york and florida while its specialty mail order pharmaceutical and medical supplies operations provide products to patients nationwide and in puerto rico 
the company s uk operations include the second largest commercial provider of home nursing and para professional care with operations located throughout the uk  as well as a leading medical respiratory supplier to areas throughout the uk the company took a number of significant steps during the eleven month period to realign its business as a focused regional home health care provider and specialty pharmacy and medical supply distributor in the us and as an integrated national provider of home and alternate site health care products and services in the uk these steps included i selling non core assets such as the company s radamerica business which provides radiation therapy in the baltimore  maryland area  ii exiting businesses that were deemed not to have the potential to earn an adequate return on capital over the long term such as wound care and orthotic product lines in the continental us  as well as the company s pulmonary rehabilitation center in cherry hill  new jersey iii completing the hmi asset sale  and iv terminating the agreements to purchase the vip companies 
in relation to these actions  the company recorded special charges of  and additional bad debt expense of  despite these special charges  the company expects to generate net cash proceeds of approximately  through the sale of radamerica and the hmi asset sale 
in addition to this restructuring and refocusing of its us operations  the company made significant strides toward becoming one of the only integrated national providers of home and alternative site health care in the uk through the purchase of omnicare for approximately  and allied for approximately  omnicare provides respiratory equipment and services and supplies a range of medical and surgical products to patients at home throughout the uk through its network of seven regional facilities 
allied is a national provider of nursing and other care giving services to home care patients with locations throughout the uk the company intends to utilize its recently acquired uk operations as a platform to introduce new products and services to the uk market which have already been widely accepted in the us  as well as for add on acquisitions 
the company believes the uk home health care market is less developed than in the uk and presents a significant opportunity to leverage its existing expertise in home health care 
the company s revenue mix and payor mix will be influenced to a significant degree by the relative contribution of acquired businesses and their respective payor profiles 
assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the products and services offered by these companies would have accounted for approximately of the combined pro forma revenue  for the eleven month period 
the following table shows the percentage of net revenues represented by each of the company s product lines eleven months ended year ended october  september  net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales net patient services net infusion services total revenues the increase in net patient services and corresponding decline in net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales and net infusion services as a percentage of total revenues from the year ended october  to the eleven month period resulted primarily from the acquisition of allied effective june  
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the percentage of total revenues for the eleven months ended september  would have been as follows net respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales  net patient services  and net infusion services 
the following table shows the payor mix for the company s total revenues for the periods presented eleven months ended year ended october  september  payor medicare medicaid private payors uk uk total revenues the decrease in medicare as a percentage of total revenues for the eleven month period as compared to fiscal and fiscal is primarily a result of the omnicare and allied acquisitions 
the company believes that its payor mix in the future will be determined primarily by the payor profile of completed acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  from shifts in existing business among payors 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the payor mix for the eleven months ended september  would have been as follows medicare  medicaid  private payors including managed care payors  and nhs 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its revenues derived from private payors was subject to case management and managed care and that this relationship will continue in the future 
the company maintains a diversified offering of home services and products in an attempt to mitigate the impact of potential reimbursement reductions for any individual product or service 
due to changing interpretation of regulations and statutes by federal and state regulatory bodies  the specialty pharmacy industry has been subject to pressure related to its marketing of respiratory therapy medications to physicians and other referral sources 
in addition  hcfa has implemented new procedures regarding the dispensing of first dose medications to patients 
these and other regulatory changes may have a negative impact on revenues of the company s respiratory medications business in the future which contributed approximately of revenue for the eleven month period  although the ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time 
the company s gross margins will be influenced by the revenue mix of its product lines and by changes in reimbursement rates 
the company historically has recognized higher gross margins from its specialized mail order and medical supplies pharmacy and respiratory therapy operations than from its nursing and infusion therapy operations 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the company owned of omnicare and allied on november   the gross profit margin for the eleven month period would have been versus the actual for the same period 
subsequent acquisitions  when completed  will continue to impact the relative mix of revenues and overall gross margin 
the company amortizes goodwill over a period of years 
the company has selected the forty year amortization convention based on the likely period of time over which related economic benefits will be realized 
the company believes its estimated goodwill life is reasonable given  among other factors  the continuing movement of patient care to non institutional settings  expanding demand due to demographic trends  the emphasis of the company on establishing coverage in each of its local and regional markets and the 
consistent 
practice of other home health care companies 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value of goodwill and the amount of any impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of goodwill 
the factors considered by management in estimating future cash flows include current operating results  trends and prospects of acquired businesses  as well as the effect of demand  competition  market and other economic factors

the increase in infusion services is as a result of an increase in therapies with higher product costs  as well as the effects of reduced reimbursement rates for certain payors 
pursuant to the recent passage of the balanced budget act  a reduction in medicare reimbursement of diabetic testing strips will become effective january  this reduction is expected to increase cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues and decrease gross profit for respiratory  medical equipment and supplies sales effective with the reimbursement reduction

additional cash requirements in the fiscal year were met through borrowings under the paribas credit agreement 
the company believes it has adequate capital resources to conduct its operations for the next twelve months 
further expansion of the company s business particularly through acquisitions may require the company to incur additional debt or offer additional equity securities if cash generated from operations  cash on hand and amounts available under the credit facility are inadequate or not available to meet its needs 
there can be no assurance that any such additional debt or equity will be available to the company  or if available  will be on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  covenants contained in the credit facility restrict the company from entering into transactions not in the ordinary course of business  including making acquisitions and issuing capital stock  without consent 
accounts receivable 
the company maintains a cash management program that focuses on the reimbursement function  as growth in accounts receivable has been the main operating use of cash historically 
at september  and october    and   respectively  of the company s total assets consisted of accounts receivable substantially from third party payors 
such payors generally required substantial documentation in order to process claims 
the collection time for accounts receivable is typically the longest for services that relate to new patients or additional services requiring medical review for existing patients 
accounts receivable increased by  from october  to september  primarily due to the inclusion of transworld uk during fiscal and the eleven month period ended september   the company experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable at its dermaquest operation whose main product lines include wound care and orthotic products 
medicare  to whom substantially all dermaquest claims are initially submitted for payment  has subjected these claims to an extensive review process and  in many cases  has required dermaquest to pursue payment through the fair hearing process of the medicare intermediary 
this has created significant delays in payments  in many cases extending beyond twelve months  leading to the significant buildup in accounts receivable and corresponding negative impact on cash flow 
the company conducted an extensive review of the dermaquest receivables in connection with the decision to discontinue these product lines in the continental us and  as a result  established additional reserves of  based on the potential inability to secure required documentation in a timely manner for reimbursement as a result of no longer being in these business lines 
in establishing the net realizable value of its accounts receivable for dermaquest  the company has relied on its historical and anticipated payment experience 
the company believes that based on current regulations  its billing and related documentation practices  and its extensive review  the dermaquest accounts receivable reflect the net realizable value of these receivables 
management s goal is to maintain accounts receivable levels equal to or less than industry averages  which will tend to mitigate the risk of recurrence of negative cash flows from operations by reducing the required investment in accounts receivable and thereby increasing cash flows from operations 
days sales outstanding dsos is a measure of the average number of days taken by the company to collect its accounts receivable  calculated from the date services are rendered 
for the eleven month period and for each of the years ended october  and  the company s average dsos were  and  respectively 
the decrease in dso s was primarily due to the inclusion of the uk operations which tend to have dso s generally less than those in the us as the proportion of third party payors claims related to alternate site health care increases  the company believes that third party payors are likely to increase their review of such claims  the effect of which would be to generally increase dsos
