item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial information and the consolidated financial statements  and related notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
general demand for and pricing of camco s equipment and services depends primarily upon the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of well service and workover activity worldwide 
drilling  completion and workover activity in turn is largely dependent on the level and volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
pricing for crude oil and natural gas continued to trend upward in west texas intermediate wti crude prices averaged per barrel higher than  or for the year 
us natural gas prices averaged per mcf  in  or cents higher than the previous year 
as a result of these higher overall commodity prices  worldwide drilling activity increased  after a slight decline in average rig count activity is summarized in the table below rig count united states canada north america   international worldwide    worldwide demand for crude oil is forecast to increase by to per year through the turn of the century 
although oil prices are expected to soften somewhat in from unusually high prices in late  the company expects oil prices to average between and per barrel 
us natural gas prices are also expected to decline from the high levels of provided that oil prices remain within this range and natural gas prices are not unusually weak  the company expects activity levels in north america to increase modestly in canadian activity is expected to remain near the high activity levels of the international rig count increased for the second consecutive year  up in to an average rig count of activity levels are expected to increase in south america as western oil companies proceed to drill and develop properties leased from government oil companies in the company expects a modest increase in overall worldwide drilling  completion and production activities 
oil production in the fsu continues to decline  representing a significant opportunity for western companies to provide oilfield equipment and services to increase production in that country 
since early  only limited project financing and hard currency has been available to fund oilfield equipment purchases and the company s sales  primarily of esps  have declined significantly over the past three years  from a peak level in camco operates in various foreign countries and is  therefore  subject to currency fluctuations in these countries 
changes in the value of the us dollar against these currencies will affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
camco conducts a portion of its business in highly inflationary environments such as south america  mexico and nigeria 
the effect of currency rate changes in these countries is reflected in the results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
in  the company recorded translation losses of million  primarily due to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in april in  translation losses were million  including approximately million due to the devaluation of the bolivar in december and approximately million due to the significant devaluation of the naira in nigeria 
additionally  during and the cumulative translation account  a component of stockholders equity  reflected gains of 
million and million  respectively  primarily due to the strengthening of the uk pound sterling versus the uk dollar 
the company actively monitors foreign subsidiaries net asset positions denominated in foreign currencies and takes actions when appropriate under the circumstances to limit its risk to currency fluctuation and devaluation 
the distribution of camco s revenues by geographic region is shown below  based upon the region in which equipment or services were sold or provided to the customer years ended december in millions united states and canada europe including fsu middle east and africa mexico and central and south america far east see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for further information related to camco s business segments and revenues by geographic region 
the information in note is based on the source from which the equipment and services originated 
results of operations compared to consolidated revenues for increased million  or  from to a record million 
this increase reflects the overall increase in worldwide drilling and completion activity and includes the effect of increased revenues attributable to business acquisitions by the company over the past two years 
oilfield equipment revenues were up to million in  led by a increase in completion product sales  particularly in the united states and canada  middle east and africa and the north sea 
esp revenues increased million  or  primarily due to higher sales in the united states  middle east and africa and europe  which included increased sales to the fsu and additional sales resulting from the acquisition of lasalle in september 
in addition  drill bit sales increased to million  with increased revenues in most regions of the world 
oilfield services revenues were up to million as an increase in coiled tubing revenues in nigeria and wireline revenues in the north sea were somewhat offset by slightly lower coiled tubing revenues in the united states 
revenues in the united states and canada increased million  or  from million in to million in increased canadian completion product sales by site and a increase in united states equipment sales  reflecting overall activity increases  accounts for the majority of the increased revenue 
revenues from sales outside of north america in were million higher than the previous year at million 
european sales were up compared to  including a million increase in esp sales to the fsu after two consecutive years of decline 
north sea revenues in also were up significantly  primarily due to increased completion products and services revenues  record pdc bit revenues and the addition of lasalle late in the third quarter 
revenues increased by more than in the middle east and africa  primarily due to higher sales of completion products and esps into that region 
partially offsetting these revenue increases  far east sales were significantly lower compared to  primarily due to decreased esp sales and lower completion products sales 
gross margins increased million to million  or of revenues in  from million  or of revenues in the majority of the margin increase is attributable to higher revenues and better margins on oilfield services resulting from cost reduction programs begun in previous years 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million  in line with the related revenue increase 
sg a as a percentage of sales in was lower than the previous year at of revenues as some of these expenses are not directly variable with revenues 
translation losses in were million less than the previous year at million  favorably affecting consolidated operating profit 
operating income increased million  or in to million 
oilfield equipment operating income increased million  oilfield services operating income increased million  partially offset by a million increase in corporate expenses 
operating income from completion products increased substantially  primarily due to the volume increase described above  improved pricing in selected markets and lower manufacturing costs as a result of higher throughput in its plants 
oilfield equipment operating income was also higher due to increased rock bit sales into the premium international markets 
the increase in oilfield services operating income is primarily a result of increased revenues and profitability attributable to higher wireline activity in the north sea and us gulf of mexico 
in addition  losses incurred by the company s coiled tubing joint venture in the fsu were million less than the previous year  as sales of condensate were sufficient to cover operating expenses in the last half of net interest expense decreased million from to million for the year 
lower borrowings on high interest rate bolivar debt in and lower debt levels on the us credit facility for accounted for most of the decrease compared to compared to consolidated revenues increased from million in to million in despite difficult business conditions in several of the company s major international markets and an overall decline in worldwide drilling activity 
oilfield equipment segment revenues increased million  or  to million in  while oilfield services revenues decreased million  or  to million in the net increase in oilfield equipment revenues was attributable to increased esp and drill bit sales in south america  an increase in esp and cable sales in the far east and an increase in completion products sales in the united states and canada 
these revenue increases were partially offset by a substantial decline in esp and cable sales to the fsu because of a lack of hard currency in that market to purchase foreign equipment and services  a decrease in completion product sales in the far east as a result of the company s strategy to focus its resources on higher margin markets  and a decrease in drill bit sales in the united states due to lower rig activity 
oilfield services revenues decreased primarily due to the divestiture of stop  the company s safety service division  in the first quarter of revenues in the united states and canada increased reflecting higher canadian completion product sales by site which was acquired in the first quarter of revenues increased in the united states and canada from million in to million in despite a decrease in us revenues due to lower activity levels this year 
revenues from sales outside of the united states and canada decreased slightly from million in to million in as a increase in product sales in south america was offset by substantial declines in esp sales to the fsu 
the decline in esp sales in the fsu resulted in a significant decrease in european sales  despite improved equipment sales in the north sea 
middle east and africa sales decreased as an increase in drill bit sales to the middle east and africa were more than offset by a decline in esp and completion product sales in this region 
mexico and central and south america sales were up substantially  reflecting increased drill bit and esp sales to venezuela  and to a lesser extent  revenue increases in other south american countries  particularly colombia 
far east revenues increased in  despite significantly lower completion product sales  as a result of improved esp and cable sales and sales of drill bits throughout the region 
gross margins increased million to million  or of revenues in  from million  or of revenues  in oilfield equipment margins improved in to approximately of revenues due to improved pricing in certain product lines and geographic regions  lower manufacturing costs resulting from prior year cost reduction programs  and a reduction in sales in highly competitive  tender bit markets such as the far east 
gross margins on oilfield services were higher at of revenues in  primarily due to a significant reduction in international service costs 
sg a increased million in to million  or of revenues 
the majority of the increase is attributable to a higher proportion of drill bit revenues  which have significantly higher selling and distribution costs than the company s other product lines 
in addition  translation losses were million higher in at million compared to million in operating income increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase in operating income consisted of an million increase in oilfield equipment operating income and a million increase in oilfield services operating income  offset by a 
million increase in corporate expenses 
the increase in oilfield equipment operating income was attributable to increased drill bit sales reflecting higher overall international activity levels  penetration of the international market by the company s roller cone bit products and increased sales of the company s pdc products 
additionally  operating income from completion products increased substantially due to higher gross margins reflecting improved pricing  reduced manufacturing costs  the company s strategy to focus its resources on higher margin markets  and the additional income resulting from the acquisition of site in the first quarter the increase in oilfield services operating income is primarily due to the improvement in coiled tubing income as a result of the reduced cost base in the nigerian operations and improved pricing in the us operations 
in addition  losses realized by the company s coiled tubing joint venture in russia were million less than the prior year 
at december   the company has guaranteed a bank loan of the venture which had an outstanding balance of million 
net interest expense in was slightly higher at million compared to in anticipation of the currency devaluation in venezuela  the company increased its local borrowings during this increase in interest expense on high interest rate bolivar debt offset the benefit of reduced interest in the united states on lower net borrowings 
financial condition capital resources and liquidity net cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
higher net income and a decrease in working capital  after excluding the increase attributable to acquisitions in  accounts for most of the increase over cash flow from operating activities exceeded capital expenditure requirements in each of the past three years and is anticipated to be sufficient to fund future capital requirements 
net cash outflows from investing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition to a significant increase in capital expenditures in  the company used million of cash to purchase lasalle engineering and the gas lift business from halliburton during net cash outflows from financing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pursuant to a share repurchase plan instituted by the company this year  camco bought back approximately  shares of its common stock  reserved and to be used exclusively for employee benefit plans  for million during the fourth quarter of the company currently has an unsecured credit facility with a group of banks for million consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving loan facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are due in december  and the term loan matures on december  interest rates on borrowings are libor based 
under the company s million credit facility  million is committed at december  total debt outstanding under the credit facility was million at both december  and borrowings under the revolving credit facility are expected to fluctuate with seasonal changes and changes in the company s financing needs 
in addition to customary representations  warranties  borrowing conditions  affirmative covenants and events of default  the credit facility includes financial covenants  with which camco is in compliance  relating to maintenance of a minimum level of net worth  maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio  a maximum ratio of funded debt to total capital and limitations on payment of dividends  fundamental changes in business  sales of assets  pledges of assets  subsidiary indebtedness  mergers  consolidation and transactions with affiliates 
the company believes that the combination of its working capital  the unused portion of the revolving credit facility and its cash flow from operations should provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its debt service requirements under the credit facility and manage its business needs 
requirements for capital capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital spending increased in and as new contracts and business opportunities warranted additional investments 
the company s service business and manufacturing operations require an ongoing level of spending to maintain the company s productive assets  and new service contracts may require upgraded equipment to meet job specifications and new safety requirements 
increased demand for leased equipment  primarily esps  substantial refurbishment and upgrade of machine tools in the completion products international plants  purchase of larger diameter capability coiled tubing units and the continued refurbishment of the rock bit plant in singapore explains most of the increase 
capital expenditures in are anticipated to increase to approximately million  primarily due to anticipated increases in spending for manufacturing machine tools and additional service equipment required for contracts
