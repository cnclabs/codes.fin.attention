risk factors that may affect future operating results all forward looking statements included in this document are based upon information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those described or implied in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the factors detailed below 
in addition  readers should consider the risk factors described from time to time in company reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the company is in the steel industry  an industry that is vulnerable to unpredictable economic cycles 
a downturn in the economy or in the company s markets could have an adverse effect on the company s performance 
the company has attempted to spread its sales across the reinforcing bar  merchant product and special bar quality markets to reduce the company s vulnerability to an economic downturn in any one product market 
the company s performance  however  can still be materially affected by changes in demand for any one of its product lines and by changes in the economic condition of the construction industry  manufacturing industry or automobile industry 
the cost of scrap is the largest element in the cost of the company s finished rebar and merchant products 
the company purchases most of its scrap on a short term basis 
changes in the price of scrap  therefore  can significantly affect the company s profitability 
changes in other raw material prices can also influence the company s profitability 
prices for some of the company s products are positively affected by the influence of trade sanctions imposed on the company s foreign competitors 
changes in these sanctions or their enforcement could adversely affect the company s results 
energy costs are also a significant factor influencing the company s results 
current reforms in the electric utility industry at the state and federal level are expected to lower energy costs in the long run 
however  numerous utilities and political groups are fighting these reforms and states are approaching the reforms in different fashions 
the possibility exists  therefore  that the company could be exposed to energy costs which are less favorable than those available to its competitors 
such a situation could materially affect the company s performance 
until completion of the memphis melt shop  currently under construction  the company s sbq division will purchase substantially all of its steel billets from third parties 
the cost of these steel billets is the largest element in the cost of the sbq division s finished products 
thus  the performance of this division  and in turn  the performance of the company  can be materially affected by changes in the price of the steel billets it buys from third parties 
the company currently is constructing a new memphis melt shop to supply billets to the company s sbq division and is participating in a joint venture to construct a dri facility in louisiana 
delays or cost overruns in either of these projects could materially adversely affect the company s future results 
while both projects are currently on schedule  these projects  like other construction projects  can be affected or delayed by factors such as unusual weather  late equipment deliveries  unforeseen conditions and untimely performance by contractors 
the company is constantly engaged in the process of evaluating new opportunities to strengthen its long term business and financial prospects 
from time to time  this process may lead the company to make strategic investments  such as acquisitions and joint ventures  which have the potential to improve the company s position in the markets in which it currently competes  as well as new markets it may choose to enter 
in connection with these investments  the company may incur  either directly or indirectly  start up expenses  losses and other charges that may have a material affect on the company s financial performance 
the company believes its labor relations are generally good 
almost the entire work force is non union and the company has never suffered a strike or other labor related work stoppage 
if this situation changes  however  the company s performance could suffer material adverse effects 
the company operates in an industry subject to numerous environmental regulations 
changes in environmental regulations or in the interpretation or manner of enforcement of environmental regulations could materially affect the company s performance 
further  the company is planning and performing certain environmental remediations 
unforeseen costs or undiscovered conditions requiring unplanned expenditures in connection with such remediations could materially affect the company s results 
the company s economic performance  like most manufacturing companies  is vulnerable to a catastrophe that disables one or more of its manufacturing facilities and to major equipment failure 
depending upon the nature of the catastrophe or equipment failure  available insurance may or may not cover a loss resulting from such a catastrophe or equipment failure and the loss resulting from such a catastrophe or equipment failure could materially affect the company s earnings 
the company anticipates that it will continue to borrow funds in the future 
increases in interest rates or changes in the company s ability to borrow funds could materially affect the company s performance 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  waste water effluents  air emissions and furnace dust management and disposal 
company management is highly conscious of these regulations  and supports an ongoing capital investment program to maintain the company s strict adherence to required standards 
the company has been advised by the virginia department of waste management of certain conditions involving the disposal of hazardous materials at the company s norfolk  virginia property which existed prior to the company s acquisition of the facility 
the site has been accepted into virginia s voluntary remediation program 
this program allows regulatory closure upon certification by the virginia department of environmental quality of the site remediation 
the company was also notified by the department of toxic substances control dtsc of the environmental protection agency of the state of california of certain environmental conditions regarding its property in emeryville  california 
the company has performed environmental assessments of these sites and developed work plans for remediation of the properties for approval by the applicable regulatory agencies 
the remediation plan for the emeryville site was approved by dtsc  and the company recently received letters from dtsc confirming that the site has been remediated in accordance with the approved remedial implementation plan 
the company has also received an approved remedial completion report 
as part of its ongoing environmental compliance and monitoring programs  the company is voluntarily developing work plans for environmental conditions involving certain of its operating facilities and properties which are held for sale 
based upon the company s study of the known conditions and its prior experience in investigating and correcting environmental conditions  the company estimates that the potential costs of these site restoration and remediation efforts may range from  to  approximately  of these costs is recorded in accrued liabilities at june  the remaining costs principally consist of site restoration and environmental exit costs to ready the idle facilities for sale  and have been considered in determining whether the carrying amounts of the properties exceed their net realizable values 
these expenditures are expected to be made in the next two years if the necessary regulatory agency approvals of the company s work plans are obtained 
though the company believes it has adequately provided for the cost of all known environmental conditions  the applicable regulatory agencies could insist upon different and more costly remediative measures than those the company believes are adequate or required by existing law 
additionally  if other environmental conditions requiring remediation are discovered  site restoration costs could exceed the company s estimates 
except as stated above  the company believes that it is currently in compliance with all known material and applicable environmental regulations 
impact of inflation the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on operations in recent years because of inflation  though margins can be affected by inflationary conditions 
the company s primary cost components are ferrous scrap  high quality semi finished steel billets  energy and labor  all of which are susceptible to domestic inflationary pressures 
finished product prices  however  are influenced by nationwide construction activity  automotive production and manufacturing capacity within the steel industry 
while the company has generally been successful in passing on cost increases through price adjustments  the effect of steel imports  severe market price competition and under utilized industry capacity has in the past  and could in the future  limit the company s ability to adjust pricing
