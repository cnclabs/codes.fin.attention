management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance for an equity real estate investment trust 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  exclusive of outparcel sales  plus depreciation and amortization as defined by nareit  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash from operations  and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs 
in march  nareit issued a clarification of its definition of ffo 
for illustrative purposes  the following table presents the company s ffo under both methods of calculation for the years and current method old method year ended year ended december  december  net income before extraordinary item     add depreciation and amortization     amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets   loss on sale of property   minority interest     ffo     average shares units outstanding     dividends declared per share note excludes depreciation of and and minority interest of and for the years ended december  and  respectively  attributed to the limited partner in solvang economic conditions substantially all leases contain provisions  including escalations of base rents and percentage rentals calculated on gross sales  to mitigate the impact of inflation

the company intends to reduce operating and leasing risks by continually improving its tenant mix  rental rates and lease terms  and by pursuing contracts with creditworthy upscale and national brand name tenants
