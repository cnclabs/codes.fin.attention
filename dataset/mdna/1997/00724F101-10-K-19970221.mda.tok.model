revenue change change total revenue revenue growth in and is attributable to increases in both licensing activity related to the company s postscript interpreter and application products shipments resulting from the release of new and enhanced products 
in  the increase in application products revenue was partially offset by the divestiture of aldus freehand in january and the discontinuance of aldus photostyler in late product unit volume as opposed to price growth was the principal factor in the company s revenue growth in application products revenue 
no customer accounted for more than percent of the company s total revenue in   or change change product group revenue licensing percentage of total revenue licensing revenue is derived from shipments by oem customers of products containing the adobe postscript interpreter and the display postscript system 
such products include standard roman printers as well as printers that work with japanese  chinese  and korean languages  imagesetters  and workstations 
licensing revenue is also derived from shipments of products containing the configurable postscript interpreter cpsi by oem customers 
cpsi is a fully functional postscript interpreter that resides on the host computer system rather than in a dedicated controller integrated into an output device 
the configuration flexibility of cpsi allows oems and software developers to create and market a variety of postscript products independently of controller hardware development 
adobe postscript products sell to the small office home office soho market  as well as the corporate enterprise and high end imagesetter markets 
the number of units shipped by oems continued to grow on an annual basis in and royalty per unit is generally calculated as a percentage of the end user list price of a printer  although there are some components of licensing revenue based on a flat dollar amount per unit that typically do not change with list prices 
during this period  some oems introduced lower end printers or reduced their list prices on lower end printers  which resulted in lower royalties per unit on such printers 
however  in and  this trend was offset by increased demand for cpsi and by increased demand for color capability as well as greater penetration into the japanese market  all of which have higher royalties per unit 
the company has seen year to year increases in the number of oem customers from which it is receiving licensing revenue and believes that such increases are attributable to the continued acceptance of postscript software  as well as to the diversification of the company s customer base across multiple platforms 
in  adobe will introduce new printgear products that will serve the soho markets 
also in  one of adobe s largest postscript customers  hewlett packard company  plans to introduce in the corporate enterprise market products that do not contain adobe postscript software 
these products are expected to contain a non adobe clone version of postscript and are expected to reach the market in july of all of these factors may impact the company s ability to maintain or sustain revenue growth in this area

application products revenue growth in was primarily due to increased demand for adobe photoshop  adobe illustrator  the adobe acrobat family of products  and sales of pagemill and sitemill 
the increase was partially offset by decreased demand for framemaker and adobe pagemaker products 
the company released photoshop for both the macintosh and windows platforms  and acrobat near the end of the fourth quarter of in addition  pagemill and sitemill  which were both released in late  added revenue in in  application products revenue increased as a result of higher sales of photoshop  pagemaker  framemaker  and the acrobat family of products 
the company released adobe pagemaker for the macintosh platform late in the third quarter of  and for the windows platform in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company released adobe photoshop for the windows platform in the first quarter of and released new acrobat products or new versions of existing products throughout the revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of aldus freehand in january and the discontinuance of aldus photostyler late in these two products aggregated million of revenue in in general  the company s application products on the windows platform have experienced greater growth than those on the macintosh platform during the company expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future

gross margins  in general  are affected by the mix of licensing revenue versus application products revenue as well as the product mix within application products 
direct costs were slightly higher in compared to as a percentage of revenue due to higher localization costs 
also  there was a general decline in in framemaker revenue and associated gross margins 
in  direct costs decreased as a percentage of revenue from  primarily from the lump sum payment in lieu of all royalty obligations to the developers of the technology underlying photoshop  which lowered direct costs for that product  as well as a continued benefit from efforts to reduce unit manufacturing costs  royalty agreement rates and typeface production costs amortization 
gross margins for application products are expected to increase slightly in because the company intends to distribute more application products via cd rom media 
operating expenses change change software development costs research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expense has increased significantly over the last three years as the company invested in new technologies  new product development  and the infrastructure to support such activities 
the increase reflects the expansion of the company s engineering staff and related costs required to support its continued emphasis on developing new products and enhancing existing products 
the company continues to make significant investments in development of its adobe postscript and application software products  including those targeted for the emerging internet market 
the company believes that continued investments in research and development are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace  and are directly related to continued  timely development of new and enhanced products 
accordingly  the company intends to continue recruiting and hiring experienced software developers

sales  marketing  and customer support expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  and other market development programs 
increases in sales  marketing  and customer support expenses in are due to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for upgrades of existing products and further development of customer and technical support services to support a growing installed base of customers 
in  reduced costs resulting from the restructuring of the combined company after the acquisition of aldus in resulted in a decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue 
for  sales  marketing  and customer support expenditures are expected to increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars in will be due to new product releases  increased investment in the windows market and programs related to furthering worldwide recognition of the adobe brand

general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses increased during compared to the increase resulted primarily from frame integration costs in the first quarter of and a higher headcount entering fiscal in addition  the increase was driven by salary increases and higher rent expense  as well as higher systems and legal costs in the decrease compared to spending reflects savings related to the restructuring of the combined company after the acquisition of aldus  partially offset by costs related to the acquisition of frame 
the company expects general and administrative spending in to be slightly higher than levels as a percentage of revenue as the company continues to incur litigation costs and invest in an expanded and more comprehensive administrative infrastructure 
change change write off of acquired in process research and development percentage of total revenue during   and  the company acquired six software companies  in separate transactions  and accounted for them using the purchase method

in  the company analyzed the remaining accrued restructuring costs related to the acquisition of aldus as well as the remaining accrued restructuring costs related to a restructuring implemented by frame 
as a result of this analysis  it was determined that approximately million represented excess reserves and  therefore  this amount was reversed and credited to merger transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of income 
at november   the remaining accrued restructuring balance relates to lease and third party contract termination payments  resulting from the planned closure of duplicate offices in europe and the united states 
these payments are expected to continue through the lease terms or negotiated early termination date  if applicable 
nonoperating income change change investment gain loss  percentage of total revenue investment gain loss consists principally of realized gains or losses from direct investments as well as mark to market valuation adjustments for adobe ventures lp investments 
investment gains and losses increased in primarily as a result of realized gains of approximatley million and approximately million for the sale of a portion of the company s investment in netscape communications corporation and its entire investment in luminous corporation  respectively 
also  a portion of one of the equity investments included in the adobe ventures lp portfolio was sold for a gain of million during and at november  the remaining portion of this investment was marked to market for an unrealized gain of approximately million

the company s effective tax rate in decreased significantly from the effective tax rate of  due primarily to smaller one time  nondeductible merger transaction and restructuring costs and increased tax exempt income 
an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

had this rate been in effect in   and  the net income per share  excluding the above one time charges gains  would have been  and per share  respectively 
factors that may affect future results of operations the company believes that in the future its results of operations could be affected by various factors such as the ability of the company to integrate adobe and frame product lines  delays in shipment of the company s new products and major new versions of existing products  market acceptance of new products and upgrades  renegotiation of royalty arrangements  growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and sales price adjustments  consolidation in the oem printer business  industry transitions to new business and information delivery models  and adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which the company does business 
the company s ability to develop and market products  including upgrades of currently shipping products  that successfully adapt to changing customer needs may also have an impact on the results of operations 
the company s ability to extend its core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could effect its ability to develop these products 
a portion of the company s future revenue will come from these products 
delays in product introductions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenue  earnings  or stock price 
the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on its sales or results of operations 
although the company generally offers its application products on macintosh  windows  and unix platforms  a majority of the overall sales of these products to date has been for the macintosh platform  particularly for the higher end macintosh computers 
if there is a slowdown of customer purchases in the higher end macintosh market or if the company is unable to increase its sales to windows customers  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
also  if the company broadens its customer base to achieve greater penetration in the corporate business and consumer markets  the company may need to adapt its application software distribution channels 
the company could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in its distribution channel which could materially adversely affect its operating results 
in addition  to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers in general  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company s oem customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
the company evaluates these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  including licensing a postscript language compatible interpreter from a third party  which could result in lower licensing revenue for the company 
during the first quarter of  there was a change in part of the company s business relationship with hewlett packard company hewlett packard 
beginning in the second half of  hewlett packard plans not to incorporate adobe postscript software in some hewlett packard laserjet printers 
the company expects to continue working with hewlett packard printer operations to incorporate adobe postscript and other technologies in other hewlett packard products 
through its acquisitions  the company has experienced significant growth 
the company s ability to effectively manage its growth will require it to continue to improve its operational and financial controls and information management systems  and to attract  retain  motivate and manage employees effectively 
the failure of the company to effectively manage growth and transition in multiple areas of its business could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
during  the company entered the internet market  which has only recently begun to develop 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the software industry addressing the authoring and electronic publishing requirements of the internet is young and has few proven products 
in addition  new models for licensing software to accomodate new information delivery practices will be needed 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost  and quality of service remain unresolved and may impact the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating income from its subsidiaries located in europe  japan  asia pacific  and latin america 
while most of the revenue of these subsidiaries is denominated in us dollars  the majority of their expense transactions are denominated in foreign currencies  including the japanese yen and most major european currencies 
as a result  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the impact of such fluctuations has been insignificant and the company has not engaged in any significant activities to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  the company generally experiences lower revenue from its european operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their business activities in the summer months 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to the company  changes in analysts earnings estimates for the company or its industry and factors affecting the corporate environment or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price
