jts and atari background on july   atari was merged into jts the merger and the separate existence of atari ceased 
although the business combination resulted in atari merging into the jts legal entity  the substance of the transaction was that atari  as a public company with substantially greater operating history and net worth  owned approximately of the equity of the merged company 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of jts by atari and  accordingly  the operating results of jts from july  forward were combined with atari s operating results and reported as jts operating results 
the aggregate purchase price of million was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities of jts 
subsequent to the merger the company changed its fiscal year from a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december to a week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to january the merger was accounted for as a purchase of jts by atari  and  as such  the historical balance sheets and the statements of operations for the prior years include atari only 
in addition  due to the change in year end  atari s balance sheet for the end of transition period as of january  is included herein  as are atari s operating results for the one month period then ended 
throughout this discussion  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended february  prior to the merger with jts  atari significantly downsized its video game operations due primarily to lack of market acceptance of its video game console  jaguar 
this downsizing resulted in significant reductions in atari s workforce and significant curtailment of research and development and sales and marketing activities for jaguar and related products 
despite the introduction of four additional game titles in the first quarter of  sales of jaguar and related software remained disappointing 
as a result  management revised estimates and wrote down inventory by million in the first quarter of and by an additional million during july the prior business of atari is now conducted through the company s atari division  however  the atari division is not expected to represent a significant portion of the company s business going forward 
the major portion of the company s business today is its disk drive division acquired in the merger with jts  which designs  manufactures and markets hard disk drives for use in notebook computers and desktop personal computers 
jts was incorporated in february and remained in the development stage until october  when it began shipping its inch palladium disk drives to customers in the united states and europe 
the company currently has three disk drive product families in production  the inch form factor nordic family for notebook computers and the inch form factor champ and champion families for desktop personal computers 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company introduced into production its higher performance champion family for desktop personal computers 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the champion drives are expected to entirely replace the champ drives 
through fiscal  the company had shipped over  disk drives  consisting primarily of inch drives 
jts began shipment of nordic disk drives to compaq in the second quarter of fiscal  however  to date volume shipments of inch drives have not occurred 
the company markets its disk drives to computer companies and systems integrators for incorporation into their computer systems and subsystems and to oems 
the company sells its products through a direct sales force operating throughout the united states  europe and asia  as well as through distributors in the united states  europe  latin america and canada 
all of jts products are manufactured in madras  india by its subsidiary  jts technology formerly moduler electronics india pvt 
ltd  which was acquired in april and employed approximately  individuals at february since its inception  jts has incurred significant losses which have resulted from the substantial costs associated with the design and development of its products  the establishment of manufacturing operations  the development of a supplier base  and the marketing of its new products and the ramp up of production volumes 
jts has yet to generate profits from its disk drive business and cannot assure that it will achieve or maintain successful operations in the future 
year ended february  compared to the atari year ended december  the year ended february  operating results include only atari for the two quarters prior to the merger date  and for the two quarters after the merger date the operations of both companies are included 
for fiscal  the company incurred a net loss of million  including a one time charge of million  compared to a net loss for atari for of million 
total revenues for the company for fiscal were million compared to million for atari for included in the million are million in revenues derived from the sales of disk drive products during the second half of fiscal on shipments of approximately  units 
for the entire fiscal year including the two quarters prior to the merger with atari  approximately  disk drives were shipped which generated revenues of million 
the prior year s revenues of million are entirely attributed to the sale of atari games  and sales of the jaguar video game console represented of the total revenue for the gross margin deficit for fiscal was million compared to million for the fiscal gross margin deficit includes million attributed to the disk drive division for the six month period after the merger and million is attributed to the atari operations for the entire year 
the fiscal gross margin deficit includes approximately million of inventory write offs related to atari games  and a provision of approximately million for inventory allowances related to the disk drive operation 
the principal reasons for these allowances are obsolete and unsalable inventory and costs associated with the repair of defective product 
jts anticipates recording future inventory allowances  the level of which will depend upon a number of factors including manufacturing yields  new product introductions  maturity or obsolescence of product designs  inventory levels and competitive pressures 
the portion of the gross margin deficit attributed to the disk drive division also included amounts provided for potential product returns and distributor price protection of million 
the hard disk drive industry has been characterized by ongoing rapid price erosion and resulting pressure on gross margins 
jts expects that hard disk drive prices will continue to decline in the future and that competitors will offer products which meet or exceed the performance capabilities of jts products 
due to such pricing pressures  jts future gross margins will be substantially dependent upon its ability to control manufacturing costs  improve manufacturing yields and introduce new products on a timely basis 
the million one time charge represented that portion of the purchase price which was attributed to in process research and development and was expensed in atari s july operations as the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses 
research and development expenses for jts for were million compared to million for atari for the prior year s research and development expenses reflect that of the video game business only  which had begun to downsize 
in the fourth quarter of  atari entirely eliminated its internal jaguar development teams and other development staff as titles for jaguar were completed 
the fiscal research and development expenses include six months of research and development expenses of the disk drive division 
the research and development expenses reflect amounts significantly greater than the expenses incurred in the prior year due primarily to salaries and benefits for staffing required for the design of disk drives and the development of manufacturing processes as well as million of expense for amortization of purchased technology acquired at the time of the merger 
going forward  the company expects that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the next fiscal year in absolute dollars but will decline as a percent of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for the decrease in such expenses was primarily a result of the atari division s staff reductions  reduced rent  reduced legal fees and other operating costs 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the next fiscal year in absolute dollars primarily to support the expansion of the disk drive marketing and sales efforts  but will decline as a percent of revenues 
other income and expense for was a net expense of million and consisted primarily of million of losses from disposal of obsolete equipment  approximately million of interest expense and approximately million of realized gain from the sale of marketable securities 
for  other income of million was primarily due to realized gains of approximately million from the sale of dixon plc holdings  which was offset by approximately million of interest expense on the million of the company s convertible debentures 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  total revenues for atari for were million compared to million for sales of jaguar and related products represented and of total revenues for and  respectively  and sales of other products and royalties represented the balance of revenues in each such year 
the reduction in revenues was primarily the result of lower unit volumes of jaguar products and lower average selling prices of jaguar and certain of its software titles 
in the first quarter of  atari reduced the suggested retail price of jaguar from its original price of to 
as a result of the jaguar price reductions  the substantial curtailment of sales and marketing activities for jaguar and the substantial curtailment of efforts by atari and independent software developers to develop additional software titles for jaguar  atari expected sales of jaguar and related products to decline substantially in and thereafter 
cost of revenues for was million compared to million for included in cost of revenues for were accelerated amortization and write offs of capitalized game software development costs of million and inventory write downs of million primarily relating to jaguar products 
as a result of these charges and lower selling prices for jaguar products and provisions for returns and allowances and price protection  gross margin for the year was a loss of million 
for  gross margin was million  or of revenues 
included in cost of revenues for were write downs of inventory of million and amortization and the write off of capitalized game software development costs of million 
as of december   atari had approximately  units of the jaguar console in inventory which was subsequently written off in research and development expenses for were million compared to million for during and  a significant number of atari employees and consultants were devoted to developing hardware and software for the jaguar  and atari contracted with third party software developers to develop jaguar software titles 
as a result of jaguar s poor sales performance  in the third and fourth quarters of  atari accelerated its amortization of contracted software development which resulted in charges in those quarters of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  atari had capitalized software development costs of  and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  atari eliminated its internal jaguar development teams and other development staff as titles for jaguar were completed 
marketing and distribution expenses for were million compared to million for such costs included television and print media  promotions and other activities to promote jaguar 
general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for the decrease in such expenses was primarily a result of staff reductions  reduced legal fees and other operating costs 
atari experienced a gain on foreign currency exchange of  for compared to a gain of million for these changes were a result of lower foreign asset exposure and a greater percentage of sales made in us dollars which further reduced exposure to foreign currency transaction fluctuations 
in  atari received million in connection with the settlement of litigation between atari  atari games corporation and nintendo 
in  atari also reached an agreement with sega  which resulted in a gain of million  after contingent legal fees  and the sale of  shares of atari common stock to sega at per share for an aggregate of million 
during  atari sold a portion of its holdings in dixon plc  a retailer in england  and realized a gain of million  of which million was realized in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  atari sold the remaining portion of its holdings and realized a gain of million 
the gain of million together with other income items resulted in a total other income of million compared to  for for each of and  interest expense was approximately million on the atari debentures 
in  atari repurchased a portion of the atari debentures and realized a gain of  as of december   the outstanding balance of these debentures was million 
interest income for and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher average cash balances in as a result of atari s operating losses  there was no provision for income taxes in as a result of the factors discussed above  atari reported a net loss for of million compared to net income of million in liquidity and capital resources as of february   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and a net worth of million 
at february   total debt  including bank credit lines and notes payable  was million 
the company had a million revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank which bore interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
as of february   all amounts available under this line were drawn 
the principal amount was replaced by a factoring arrangement of the same amount which the company entered into with silicon valley bank in april during the company also entered into an agreement with a european bank to finance certain of the company s european accounts receivable 
at february   million was outstanding under this agreement 
the company also had equipment lease financing of million at february  there were million of working capital loans outstanding between jts technology and two indian banks at interest rates ranging from to as of february   as well as borrowing under term loan facilities with the industrial credit and investment corporation of india limited icici and the shipping credit and investment corporation of india limited sici in the amount of million at interest rates of libor plus and libor plus  respectively 
the term loans are due in through amounts borrowed under these loan agreements have been used for working capital purposes  tooling  facilities expansion and purchases of capital equipment 
certain sources of financing in india require the company to comply with stringent financial covenants 
in this regard  certain unsecured debt and equity required under one loan agreement has not been obtained 
however  management believes that the lender is unlikely to require jts to immediately repay advances outstanding for non compliance with debt covenants 
jts believes that such matter will not have a material adverse effect on jts business  operating results or financial condition 
however  jts may not be able to renew or maintain its current indian financing facilities and its failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on jts business  operating results and financial condition 
at february   the company had million of convertible subordinated debentures due april   which had originally been issued by atari in jts has yet to generate profits and cannot assure that profits will be attained or that jts will achieve or maintain successful operations in the future 
the company s accounts receivable are heavily concentrated with a small number of customers 
if any large customer of the company became unable to pay its debts to the company  liquidity would be adversely affected 
in the event the company is unable to increase sales or maintain production yields at acceptable levels there would be a significant adverse impact on liquidity 
this would require the company to either obtain additional capital from external sources or to curtail its capital  research and development and working capital expenditures 
such curtailment could adversely affect the company s operations and competitive position 
due to delays in the receipt of additional financing  the company took action in september to conserve its cash resources by reducing the production of drives planned for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in september  the company sold certain of its real estate acquired from atari in the merger to one of its board members for million 
the property was sold at fair value  and the company has an option to repurchase the property one year from the date of sale for million 
also  in early november  the company completed a million private financing involving the sale of its series b preferred stock 
in january  the company completed a million private financing involving the sale of its series c preferred stock 
the company will need significant additional financing resources over the next several years for working capital  facilities expansion and capital equipment 
in fiscal year  the company plans approximately million in capital expenditures related primarily to equipment and facilities required to increase drive production volumes in its madras  india facility 
in addition  significant cash resources will be required to fund purchases of inventory needed to achieve anticipated sales levels 
failure to obtain such cash resources will negatively impact the company s ability to manufacture its products at required levels 
the company is currently pursuing working capital and equipment financing options and  in april  received commitments for a million revolving line of credit  a million accounts receivable line and a million equipment lease line from three financial institutions 
the precise amount and timing of the company s funding needs beyond these amounts cannot be determined at this time and will depend upon a number of factors  including the market demand for its products  the progress of the company s product development efforts and the company s inventory and accounts receivable management 
the company currently expects that it would seek to obtain such funds from additional borrowing arrangements and or public offering of debt and equity securities 
there can be no assurance that funds required by the company in the future will be available on terms satisfactory to the company or at all 
as of february   the company had federal net operating losses nols and tax credit carryforwards in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively 
under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  certain changes in the ownership or business of a corporation that has nols or tax credit carryforwards will result in the inability to use or the imposition of significant restrictions on the use of such nols or tax credit carryforwards to offset future income and tax liabilities of the company 
the merger between atari and jts constituted a change in ownership with respect to jts and  accordingly  restricts the use of jts pre merger nols against post merger income of the company to the maximum of million per year  unless previously expired 
in addition  subsequent events may result in the imposition of restrictions on the ability of the company to utilize its nols and tax credit carryforwards 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to utilize all or any of its nols or tax credit carryforwards
