through december   the company s principal sources of financing have been its initial and follow on public offerings of common stock  placements of the company s preferred and common stock and funds received under the company s corporate collaborations

most of these commitments are cancelable within a three to six month period and limit the amounts payable by the company for sponsored research under the programs after notice of cancellation by the company 
from time to time  the company evaluates potential investments in complementary businesses  products or technologies

accordingly  it is expected that the company s capital lease obligations and related interest expense as well as its depreciation expense will increase in future periods 
the company estimates that its existing capital resources  together with facility and equipment financing  anticipated revenues from its current collaborations and net income from investment activities  will be sufficient to fund its planned operations into the second half of the company anticipates that the funds from future collaborations will extend this time period 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will enter into any such collaborations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the underlying assumed levels of revenue and expense will prove accurate 
whether or not these assumptions prove to be accurate  the company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations 
the company intends to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings and capital lease transactions  however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to stockholders may result 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners  such arrangements may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is at an early stage of development and must be evaluated in light of the uncertainties and complications present in a biotechnology company 
the company has been in existence only since and to date two drug candidates su and su have entered human clinical testing 
to achieve profitable operations on a continuing basis  the company  alone or with collaborative partners  must successfully develop  manufacture  introduce and market its proposed products 
products  if any  resulting from the company s research and development programs are not expected to be commercially available for a number of years  even if they are developed successfully and proven to be safe and effective 
before obtaining regulatory clearance for the commercial sale of any of its products under development  the company must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the potential product is safe and efficacious for use in humans for each target indication 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product under clinical development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the potential product and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  many of the company s currently proposed products are subject to development and licensing arrangements with the company s collaborators 
therefore  the company is dependent on the research and development efforts of these collaborators with respect to some of its proposed products and is entitled only to a portion of the revenues  if any  realized from the commercial sale of any of the potential products covered by the collaborations in many jurisdictions 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since its inception 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses at least for the next several years and expects cumulative losses to increase as the company s research and development efforts  including preclinical and clinical testing  are expanded 
substantially all of the company s revenues to date have been received pursuant to the company s collaborations 
should the company or its collaborators fail to perform in accordance with the terms of any of their agreements  any consequent loss of revenue under the agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the foregoing risks reflect the company s early stage of development and the nature of the company s industry and potential products 
also inherent at the company s stage of development are a range of additional risks  including manufacturing uncertainties  the company s lack of sales and marketing capabilities  competition  uncertainties regarding protection of patents and proprietary rights  government regulation and uncertainties regarding pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement
