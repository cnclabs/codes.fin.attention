liquidity and capital resources in october  the company received  from dr solomon s software for its virex and netoctopus product lines 
the company s management believes that its currently anticipated capital needs for future operations of the company will be satisfied through at least september  by funds currently available from the above mentioned sale 
the company also has its unused  bank lines of credit 
working capital decreased by approximately  during fiscal primarily as a result of unprofitable operations of and cash flow required by the company s international subsidiaries 
management believes that the company s current operations are not materially impacted by the effects of inflation 
certain factors that may affect future results the company does not provide forecasts of its future financial performance 
however  time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts including  but not limited to statements contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to liquidity and capital resources may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed below and within this form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s future operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter because of uncertainties and or risks associated with such things as technological change  competition  delays in the introduction of products or product enhancements and general market trends 
historically  the company has operated with little backlog of orders because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
because the company s staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s costs are fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such variations in operating results in the future or that such variations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
dependence on principal products in fiscal  monarch and q support accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
subsequent to year end with the disposal of the virex and netoctopus products  the company is wholly dependent on such principal products 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of either of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of its new and enhanced versions of these products and development of new versions of these and other products and subsequent acceptance of such new and enhanced products 
in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
international sales in  and  international sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of its revenues 
a significant portion of the company s net sales will therefore be subject to risks associated with international sales  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in account receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
acquisition strategy the company has addressed and may continue to address the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving and maintaining the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies business is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
dependence on new introductions  new product delays growth in the company s business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products 
the length of product life cycles depends in part on end user demand for new or additional functionality in the company s products 
if the company fails to accurately anticipate the demand for  or encounters any significant delays in developing or introducing  new products or additional functionality on its products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business 
product life cycles can also be affected by the introduction by suppliers of operating systems of comparable functionality within their products 
the failure of the company to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company s competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than the company s products 
such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
software products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential end users  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
rapid technological change the markets in which the company competes have undergone  and can be expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change 
the ability of the company to grow will depend on its ability to successfully update and improve its existing products and market and license new products to meet the changing demands of the marketplace and that can compete successfully with the existing and new products of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully anticipate and satisfy the changing demands of the personal computer software marketplace  that the company will be able to continue to enhance its product offerings  or that technological changes in hardware platforms or software operating systems  or the introduction of a new product by a competitor  will not render the company s products obsolete 
competition in the pc software industry the software market for personal computers is highly competitive and characterized by continual change and improvement in technology 
several of the company s existing and potential competitors including ibm  mcafee associates  inc  remedy  astea and applix have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future 
year issue although the company does not expect that year issues will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition  the company is exposed to year issues with respect to internal software and external product offerings 
should this issue not be addressed properly  there may be an event that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results 
the company continues to undertake an evaluation of these issues 
dependence on proprietary software technology the company s success is dependent upon proprietary software technology 
although the company does not own any patents on any such technology  it does hold exclusive licenses to such technology and relies principally on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect its rights to such proprietary technology 
despite such precautions  there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of such technology 
reliance on software license agreements substantially all of the company s products incorporate third party proprietary technology which is generally licensed to the company on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
failure by such third parties to continue to develop technology for the company and license such technology to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
indirect distribution channels during  and  the company derived approximately  and  respectively  of its net sales through resellers  none of which are under the direct control of the company 
the loss of major resellers of the company s products  or a significant decline in their sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
other than ingram micro inc  which accounted for approximately   and of the company s  and net sales  respectively  no reseller or other customer accounted for more than of the company s revenues in  or there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain additional qualified resellers or that any such resellers will be able to effectively sell the company s products 
the company seeks to select and retain resellers on the basis of their business credentials and their ability to add value through expertise in specific vertical markets or application programming expertise 
in addition  the company relies on resellers to provide post sales service and support  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business 
volatility of stock price as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating companies acquired by the company  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomics conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of the company 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies
