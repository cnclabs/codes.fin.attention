item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company desires to take advantage of the new safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s report on form k contains forward looking statements including statements concerning projections  plans  objectives  future events or performance and underlying assumptions and other statements which are other than statements of historical fact 
the company wishes to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  may have affected and could in the future affect the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for subsequent periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company a the company s ability to meet debt service requirements  b the company s ability to compete successfully with other radio broadcasters  c the possibility of adverse governmental action or regulatory restrictions from those administering the antitrust laws  the fcc or other governmental authorities  d the availability of funds under its credit agreements to fund acquisitions for the foreseeable future  or  if such funds are inadequate  the ability of the company to obtain new or additional debt or equity financing and the potential dilutive effect of any such equity financing and e the company s ability to successfully operate existing and any subsequently acquired stations and towers  particularly with the increasing number and geographic diversity of its operations 
general the company s financial results are dependent on a number of factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  ability to provide popular programming  local market competition  relative efficiency of radio broadcasting compared to other advertising media  signal strength and government regulation and policies 
the primary operating expenses involved in owning and operating radio stations are employee salaries  depreciation and amortization  programming expenses  solicitation of advertising and promotion expenses 
during the years ended december  and  none of the company s markets represented more than of the company s station operating income ie  net operating revenue less station operating expenses before depreciation and amortization  other than the boston market 
for the years ended december  and the boston market accounted for an aggregate of approximately of the company s station operating income 
as a consequence of the numerous acquisitions consummated by the company in  the boston markets significance in relation to the company s consolidated financial results has declined and other markets  particularly the hartford market  have emerged as significant contributors to station operating income 
for the year ended december   both the boston and hartford market individually accounted for an aggregate of approximately of the company s station operating income 
while historically  radio revenues in the boston and hartford markets have remained relatively stable  an adverse change in the radio market or the station s relative market position could have a significant impact on the company s operating results as a whole 
the relative significance of the boston and hartford markets is expected to decline in and thereafter  as the company reports the full impact of operating results of and subsequent station acquisitions 
the company s revenues are affected primarily by the advertising rates the company s stations are able to charge 
these rates are in large part based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports by independent national rating services 
because audience ratings in the local market are crucial to a station s financial success  the company endeavors to develop strong listener loyalty 
the company believes that the diversification of formats on its radio stations helps the company to insulate itself from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public on any particular format 
general continued the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular radio station 
the company s stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to generate advertising time sales in exchange for goods or services used in the operation of the stations  instead of cash 
the company minimizes its use of trade agreements and historically has sold over of its advertising time for cash 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run only for a few weeks 
in each of  and  approximately of the company s revenue was generated from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each station s sales staff 
to generate national advertising sales  the company engages an independent advertising sales representative that specializes in national sales for each of its stations 
the company s first calendar quarter historically produces the lowest revenues for the year  while each of the other quarters produces roughly equivalent revenues 
the major league baseball labor dispute adversely impacted the company s and financial performance 
the company has contractual commitments to pay fees in connection with the exclusive rights to broadcast the games of the boston red sox and seasons and the boston celtics through the seasons 
the fees payable by american under these arrangements currently aggregate more than million annually through  million in and million in and are payable on a pro rata basis for games played 
during  the major league baseball labor dispute caused the company to lose more than million of booked advertising business plus  the company believes  an indeterminate amount of other potential advertising revenue with a corresponding reduction in expenses of approximately million  representing mostly rights fees 
historically  the majority of a total season s advertising is placed during the six months prior to the start of the regular season 
with respect to the boston red sox season  the company continued to place advertising in anticipation of a resolution of the dispute in time for the start of the regular season 
however  in light of the uncertainties as to the timing and nature of such resolution  and despite an aggressive effort  placed advertising in was approximately million less than placed advertising not giving effect to a million loss in caused by the labor dispute 
the company  over a period of several months  discussed with the boston red sox a reduction in the approximately million of rights fees payable for the full season which would have been million based on the shortened season 
those discussions resulted in an amendment to the agreement providing for a reduction in the fees to approximately million  an extension of the agreement for one year to include the season and a prepayment by american for such extension and of such season s fees of million 
due to the absence of a collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the players  there can be no assurance that there may not be future labor disputes that could adversely affect the company s subsequent financial performance

the company is also required to redeem the senior subordinated notes upon the occurrence of certain events

the company has entered into numerous station and tower acquisition and related agreements see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consummation of each of these agreements is subject to  among other things  fcc approval and in some cases expiration or earlier termination of the hart scott rodino act waiting period and the negotiation of definitive agreements

liquidity and capital resources continued the company expects capital expenditures in to be approximately million  consisting principally of tower construction  office consolidations and ongoing technical improvements 
to the extent that funds generated from operations  or available cash  are insufficient to finance non recurring capital expenditures  the company would seek to borrow the necessary funds under the credit agreement 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company s operating results
