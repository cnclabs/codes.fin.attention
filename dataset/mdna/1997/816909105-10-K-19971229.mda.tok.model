overview the company was incorporated in to develop  manufacture and market innovative manufacturing equipment for the semiconductor industry  and shipped its first product  a spin rinser dryer  that year 
during the s  the company introduced several generations of its acid and solvent spray chemical processing tools and vertical furnaces  and began to market its products to manufacturers outside the semiconductor industry 
since  the company has developed its equinox single substrate chemical processing system  its storm wafer carrier cleaning system  and its magnum automated multimodule chemical processing system 
in the last year the company has completed development of its mm tools  the magnum  and express furnace 
the company has also developed the industry s first production ready copper plating tool  the equinox lt in response to increased demand for the company s established and recently introduced products  the company expanded its montana facility in and from approximately  square feet at the beginning of fiscal to approximately  square feet at the end of fiscal the company built a separate  square foot facility  also in montana  in fiscal in addition  during fiscal the company increased its production capacity by completing a  square foot facility in cambridge  england 
the unit selling prices for the company s products range from  to  for a spin rinser dryer  to  to over million for the magnum and lt linear copper plating tool 
due to these relatively high unit selling prices  a significant portion of the company s revenue in any given period is often derived from the sale of a relatively small number of units 
from time to time  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in its results of operations  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future sales 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet expectations  operating results will be adversely affected 
a variety of factors have an influence on the company s operating results in a particular period 
these factors include specific economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  customer cancellations or delays of shipments  specific feature requests by customers  production delays or manufacturing inefficiencies  management decisions to commence or discontinue product lines  the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis  the introduction of new products by the company or its competition  the selection of the company s or its competitors products by semiconductor manufacturers for new generations of fabrication facilities  the timing of research and development expenditures  exchange rate fluctuations  and expenses attendant to acquisitions  strategic alliances and the further development of marketing and service capabilities 
the company markets and sells its products worldwide with an emphasis on europe and asia as its principal international markets 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  although the percentage of international sales may fluctuate from period to period 
the company believes its sales  service and support organizations are important to the long term success of its customer relationships 
the company provides sales  service and support worldwide  primarily through direct employees in the united states  europe  japan  korea  and through distributors elsewhere in the world 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s actual and pro forma results of operations for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended september  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development cost of technology rights total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income pro forma statement of operations data income from operations before pro forma adjustments elimination of cost of technology rights income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended september  and net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from sales of equipment  spare parts and service contracts 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales of the company s automated batch chemical processing tools accounted for the majority of the increase 
the company shipped a number of new tool models during the first wafer batch size magnum with a newly designed work in process wip station was delivered during the fiscal year 
new versions of magnum also include vision systems to guide the robotics and an ozone injection system designed to decrease operating expenses and enhance performance 
in addition to our own proprietary  newly designed model based temperature controller which decreases cycle time  the express furnace received new robotics and a fully standard mechanical interface smif compatible wip station 
the adoption of any of these tools for future widespread production use is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  performance and pricing competition from other equipment manufacturers 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
gross profit 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the company s gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the costs to manufacture  service and support new and enhanced products  as well as the mix and average selling prices of products sold 
the company believes that the largest single factor in the gross margin decline is costs and inefficiencies related to recently developed products 
the company anticipates that the cost to manufacture and support the newer tool models will improve over time  but that it will continue to design and sell additional models of its existing tools and additional tool types  which may somewhat offset the anticipated improvement in gross margins 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in the prior year 
the million increase in sg a expense in as compared to reflects higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  a broader range of equipment to market and service  and costs associated with additional sales and service personnel supporting the domestic and asian marketplaces 
a substantial portion of the company s sg a expense is fixed in the short term 
while it is the company s goal to reduce sg a expense as a percentage of net sales during periods of rising sales  a decline in net sales would cause the company s selling  general and administrative expense to increase as a percentage of net sales and could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees and other costs associated with the company s research and development efforts 
r d expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in the prior year 
major projects during the year include development of the equinox lt linear copper plating tool and the completion of development of the mm magnum and mm express products 
spending on r d increased or million in absolute dollars over the prior year due to the number and complexity of projects undertaken 
the company is committed to technology leadership in the semiconductor equipment industry and expects to continue to fund research and development expenditures with a multiyear perspective 
such funding has resulted in fluctuations in r d expenses from period to period in the past 
the company expects such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net sales 
other income expense 
interest income on short term investments declined from  in fiscal to  in provision for income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes for and were million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
years ended september  and net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from sales of equipment  spare parts and service contracts 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales of the company s automated batch chemical processing tools and its single substrate processor accounted for the majority of the increase 
aggregate sales for these two tool types increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company shipped a number of new tool models during new automated batch chemical processing tools included two models for processing glass substrates used in the manufacture of flat panel displays and multichip modules  an immersion tool for processing silicon wafers  and a carrierless spray processing tool 
new single substrate processor models were introduced for plating  including multilevel interconnect processes for advanced integrated circuit devices 
a vertical furnace with much faster thermal ramp capabilities was shipped to three different customers 
the company also shipped a new model of its carrier cleaning system developed late in and a chemical delivery unit to interface between bulk chemical storage and the company s batch and single substrate chemical processing tools 
the adoption of any of these tools for future widespread production use is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  performance and pricing competition from other equipment manufacturers 
in february of  the company merged with semy engineering  inc semy in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests and consequently  the company s financial statements prior to the merger have been restated to include semy 
semy accounted for of sales and of sales after eliminating intercompany transactions 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
gross profit 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the company s gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the costs to manufacture  service and support new and enhanced products  as well as the mix and average selling prices of products sold 
the company believes that the largest single factor in the gross margin decline is costs and inefficiencies related to the manufacturing and servicing of recently developed products 
the number of new tool models introduced in fiscal was unprecedented in the company s history  both as to number and complexity 
the company anticipates that the cost to manufacture and support the newer tool models will improve over time  but that it will continue to design and sell additional models of its existing tools and additional tool types  which may somewhat offset the anticipated improvement in gross margins 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in the prior year 
the million increase in sg a expense in as compared to reflects higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  a broader range of equipment to market and service  costs associated with additional sales and service personnel supporting the asian marketplace  and employee severance cost accruals provided at year end in response to a decline in the company s fourth quarter bookings  partially offset by reduced employee bonus costs 
the decline in these expenses  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to improved overhead absorption 
a substantial portion of the company s sg a expense is fixed in the short term 
while it is the company s goal to continue to reduce sg a expense as a percentage of net sales during periods of rising sales  a decline in net sales would cause the company s selling  general and administrative expense to increase as a percentage of net sales and could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations

such funding has resulted in fluctuations in r d expenses from period to period in the past 
the company expects such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net sales 
cost of technology rights 
in  the company acquired certain technology rights from raymon f 
thompson for installment payments equal to of revenues from the sale of certain of the company s products that embody the technology 
all expense recognized in fiscal relates to the period from october  to february  all payments for technology rights ceased in conjunction with the company s initial public offering  resulting in no cost to the company from that point forward  including all of fiscal other income expense 
interest income on short term investments declined from  in fiscal to  in as the funds raised in the company s initial public offering have been invested in receivables  inventory and fixed assets 
the company realized a net loss of  on the sale of fixed assets in compared to a net gain of  the year before 
provision for income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes for and were million and million  respectively 
effective in  the company elected to have its united states income taxed under subchapter s of the code 
the company  however  remained a taxpaying entity for montana state income tax purposes 
income tax provisions recognized by the company after and before february  relate to state income taxes and taxes imposed by foreign governments on the company s foreign operations 
the company terminated its subchapter s election as of the close of business on january  and subsequent to that date became subject to federal income taxation at the corporate level 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth since its february initial public offering primarily through amounts raised in conjunction with that offering  operations and borrowings on its revolving line of credit 
cash generated by operating activities in fiscal was million as compared to million used by operations in fiscal substantial investments in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in customer advances in were more than offset by net income and non cash expenses 
as of september   the company had million of accounts receivable and million of inventory  compared to million of accounts receivable and million of inventory at september  as is customary in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  products are generally built to fill specific customer orders  with typical order fulfillment times ranging from four to six weeks for certain products to six months or more for more complex products 
accordingly  while the company s finished goods inventory accounts for slightly over of total inventory  overall inventory levels tend to fluctuate with the level and type of orders received 
currently  the tools with the longest average cycle times are the automated batch chemical tools and the single substrate processor 
the company expects future receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal investing activities consisted primarily of acquisitions of property and equipment and intangible assets in fiscal property and equipment purchases used cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the company constructed and put into service a separate satellite facility in kalispell totaling approximately  square feet and refurbished one of the several buildings on the cambridge  england site for use as office space and an inventory storage depot 
in connection with the merger of semy  the company invested million in a covenant not to compete with certain of the principals of semy 
financing activities consisted primarily of million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million of long term debt repayments 
as of september   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million available under the company s million revolving line of credit  and million under a long term facility renewed during the fourth quarter of fiscal both credit facilities are with seafirst bank and bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate 
the revolving line of credit expires on march  when all principal amounts owing are due 
the long term credit facility expires on december  with principal amounts outstanding repayable in monthly principal and interest payments over a five year period ending december the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  funds generated from operations  and funds available under its bank lines will be sufficient to meet the company s planned capital requirements during the next twelve months including the spending of approximately million to purchase property  plant and equipment 
the company believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
the company may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company may effect additional equity or debt financings to fund such activities or to fund greater than anticipated growth 
the sale of additional equity securities or the issuance of equity securities in a business combination could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
litigation a class action lawsuit brought by dr 
stanley bierman  ira case no 
dv a was filed on february   in the montana eleventh judicial district court  flathead county  kalispell  montana against the company and certain of its officers and directors 
the complaint includes allegations that the company issued misleading statements concerning its business and prospects 
the suit seeks injunctive relief  damages  costs and other relief as the court may find appropriate 
the company believes the lawsuit to be without merit and intends to contest the action vigorously 
however  given the inherent uncertainty of litigation  insurance issues  and the early stage of discovery  there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome will be in the company s favor  or that if the ultimate outcome is not in the company s favor  that such an outcome  the diversion of management s attention  and any costs associated with the lawsuit  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in february  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  earnings per share was issued 
sfas established standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps and simplifies the existing standards 
this standard will replace the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
it also requires the dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and will require a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods and requires restatement of all prior period eps data presented 
the company does not believe the application of this standard will have a material effect on its earnings per share 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  comprehensive income  was issued 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements

sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was issued 
sfas establishes standards for the way that a public enterprise reports information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires restatement of earlier periods presented 
the company does not believe the application of this standard will have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
foreign exchange contracts the company conducts its japanese business in japanese yen 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily as an economic hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations of its japanese subsidiary 
in  these contracts were denominated in the japanese yen 
the maturities of the forward foreign exchange contracts are generally short term in nature 
the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward foreign exchange contracts offsets the related impact on anticipated transactions denominated in yen 
net foreign currency gains and losses have not been material
