general the company was founded in to develop effervescent drug delivery technologies and focused initially on contract manufacturing liquid effervescent products 
over cima s history  the business focus has evolved 
in september  patent claims were allowed on the company s orasolv registered trademark technology 
orasolv registered trademark is an oral dosage form which incorporates microencapsulated drug ingredients into a tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth without chewing or water and which effectively masks the taste of the medication being delivered 
following issuance of the us patent covering orasolv registered trademark  the company began to emphasize and focus on the development of orasolv registered trademark products and currently focuses primarily on such products 
additional drug delivery technologies are also under development 
cima continues to be a development stage company 
at december   the company had accumulated net losses of approximately  the company s revenues have been from product sales using the company s autolution registered trademark a liquid effervescent technology  license fees paid by corporate partners in consideration of the transfer of rights under collaboration agreements  and research and development fees paid by corporate partners to fund the company s research and development efforts for products developed under such agreements 
to date  such revenues have been derived primarily from manufacturing agreements with third parties for liquid effervescent and other products  and to a lesser extent from research and development fees and licensing arrangements  the latter generated primarily in the last five years 
in  there were no revenues from manufacturing liquid effervescent products 
this is a result of the company s decision to discontinue contract manufacturing liquid effervescent products and focus almost exclusively on developing its orasolv registered trademark technology 
the last revenues for manufacturing liquid effervescent products were recognized in in addition to revenues from such manufacturing  research and development and licensing  the company has funded operations from private and public sales of equity securities  realizing net proceeds of approximately  from private sales of equity securities and  and  from the company s july initial public offering and may public offering of its common stock  respectively 
the total shares outstanding at december  were  the company expects that losses will continue through at least  even though cima expects to be generating sales revenue from manufacturing orasolv registered trademark products 
research and development expenses will increase as cima investigates new drug delivery technologies  including the possibility of utilizing microencapsulation for the development of controlled release systems  as well as sublingual systems which could deliver faster absorption of drug ingredients 
personnel costs for research and development  and administration are expected to remain relatively stable as the majority of the necessary personnel for these functions have already been hired 
as cima prepares for its first commercial launch of a product incorporating its orasolv registered trademark technology  additional operations personnel may need to be added 
operating expenses will increase prior to the initial product launch by one of cima s corporate partners 
the company s ability to generate revenues is dependent upon its ability to develop new  innovative drug delivery technologies and to enter into and be successful in collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies for the development and manufacture of orasolv registered trademark products to be marketed by these corporate partners 
the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the corporate partners to successfully market orasolv registered trademark products 
although the company believes these partners will have an economic motivation to market these products vigorously  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to marketing are not within the control of the company 
these partners independently could make material marketing and other commercialization decisions which could adversely affect the company s future revenues 
moreover  certain of the company s products are seasonal in nature and the company s revenues could vary materially from quarter to quarter depending on which of such products  if any  are then being marketed 
in recent years  the company has actively marketed its orasolv registered trademark technology to the pharmaceutical industry 
the company is presently engaged in product development and manufacturing scale up efforts and negotiations with several different pharmaceutical companies regarding a variety of potential products 
in the fourth quarter of  the company signed a supply agreement with an undisclosed major pharmaceutical company 
the agreement covers full scale production of an over the counter product in cima s orasolv registered trademark dosage form 
the retail launch for this product is expected in regarding the other efforts mentioned above  there can be no assurance that these activities or discussions will result in license agreements or the marketing of products using the orasolv registered trademark technology 
the company believes that mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years  together with changes in product plans by potential partners  may have had an adverse effect on the progress of certain projects  and the eventual marketing of products incorporating the company s technology 
results of operations years ended december    and the company s results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the increased focus on development of orasolv registered trademark products with an anticipated commercial launch of an orasolv registered trademark product in in  product sales were zero as the company ceased to manufacture liquid effervescent products in the second quarter of net sales decreased to  in from  in due to the termination of contract manufacturing such liquid effervescent products 
in the future  the company expects to derive revenue from the sale of orasolv registered trademark products  and no longer from the sale of contract manufactured liquid effervescent products 
research and development fees and licensing revenues were   and  in  and  respectively 
research and development fees alone were   and  in  and  respectively 
this increase in research and development fees is a reflection of the progress of the development agreements with multinational pharmaceutical companies 
the licensing revenues in   and reflect completion of obligations under license and development agreements with multinational pharmaceutical companies that provided for one time licensing fees  milestone payments  royalties and manufacturing fees 
so long as the company has relatively few agreements with corporate partners  these revenues will tend to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis 
cost of goods sold decreased to zero in from  and  in and  respectively  resulting from the discontinuation of liquid effervescent contract manufacturing 
cost of sales will increase due to the beginning of commercial production of orasolv registered trademark products  which the company commenced in february research and product development expenses were  in  compared to  in  and  in the decrease in from was the result of a one time product development optimization charge in of  from an independent consultant for improving product taste and packaging of orasolv registered trademark products 
the increase in compared to is due to the increased staffing levels to support the projects of cima s corporate partners 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in  compared to  in  and  in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in from due to downsizing and reduced executive bonus payouts 
expenses increased in  compared to  resulting from increased consumer marketing studies to support orasolv registered trademark  and one time expenses for changes in top management 
net interest income was  in compared to  in and  in net interest is dependent upon the cash position of the company 
interest income is recognized from cash balances resulting primarily from the initial public offering in  and the public offering in liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date primarily through private and public sales of its equity securities and revenues from manufacturing agreements 
through december   cima has received net offering proceeds from such private and public sales of approximately  and had net sales from manufacturing agreements of approximately  among other things  these funds were used to purchase approximately  of capital equipment  including approximately  in the last two quarters of in connection with completing the company s new eden prairie manufacturing facility 
in july the company completed an initial public offering of shares of its common stock  realizing net proceeds of approximately  and in may the company completed another public offering of shares of its common stock  realizing net proceeds of approximately  the funds raised in cima s initial public offering have been used to build out the manufacturing facility  purchase and validate the appropriate production equipment  complete the research and development facilities and purchase the necessary equipment for that facility 
in  cima successfully completed an fda establishment inspection  a minnesota state inspection and was granted a drug enforcement agency license 
the company has used the funds raised in its may public offering primarily to prepare for commercial production in its new manufacturing facility and to fund research and development for the application of the orasolv registered trademark technology  and new technologies  to pharmaceutical products 
the balance of such funds will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the company s long term capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the status of the company s collaborative arrangements  the progress of the company s research and development programs and receipt of revenues from sales of the company s products 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately  at december  the company believes that its currently available funds  including any license fees and sales revenue anticipated to be received in the future  will meet its needs at least through there can be no assurance that  prior to such time the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  including equity financing which may be dilutive to stockholders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional funds if its capital resources are exhausted  or that funds will be available on terms attractive to the company 
the company has not generated taxable income through december at december   the net operating losses available to offset taxable income were approximately  because the company has experienced ownership changes  pursuant to internal revenue code regulations  future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards will be limited in any one fiscal year 
the carryforwards expire beginning in as a result of the annual limitations  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce potential federal income tax liabilities
