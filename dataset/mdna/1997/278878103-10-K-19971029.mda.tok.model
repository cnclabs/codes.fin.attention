recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in the second quarter of fiscal year  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
earnings per share  will become effective for the company 
sfas no 
simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share eps previously found in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
earnings per share  and makes them comparable to international eps standards 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
it also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps pursuant to opinion this statement requires restatement of all prior periods eps data presented 
the company estimates that sfas no 
will not have a material effect on reported earnings per share
