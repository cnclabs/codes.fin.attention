the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and the company believes that they may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future with lower product revenues in the first and second fiscal quarters as compared with the third and fourth fiscal quarters  primarily attributable to the lower demand for certain women s health related medical procedures during the summer months and the december holiday season in the united states and europe
