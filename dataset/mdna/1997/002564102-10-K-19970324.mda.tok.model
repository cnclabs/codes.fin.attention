item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of continuing operations net sales from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased percent to  from  in due to efforts to further expand and diversify our customer base 
the increase is also a result of the general economic recovery in the geographic regions serviced by the company s facilities 
in addition  included a full year of operation for the company s las vegas facility 
the improved economic conditions  if maintained  should provide the ability for the company to grow its revenues in these efforts also provide the groundwork for broadening the company s revenues among its different markets  thereby decreasing its dependence on any one of its markets 
industry wide sales of asbestos abatement products are expected to remain relatively flat in however  the company s sales and share of the asbestos abatement market are expected to continue to increase primarily because of the marketplace s recognition of the company as a reliable and stable supplier 
spending on asbestos abatement declined in the us over the past several years due largely to the lack of full recovery in the commercial real estate industry 
concerns raised about the comparative health risks of removing asbestos and the costs related to such removal  as opposed to leaving it in place  also have resulted in the delay or cancellation of some projects 
the company also believes that as the us economy continues its expansion  it will have a positive impact on its operations 
notwithstanding the above  the asbestos abatement industry will likely diminish over time as asbestos containing materials  last used in construction during  ultimately are removed from schools  office buildings  homes and factories 
a estimate by an industry analyst predicted that as much as billion may be spent nationwide over a year period for asbestos removal  of which the company estimates billion relates to abatement supplies 
approximately billion in abatement supplies will be spent during this year period in the geographic areas served by the company s eight distribution centers 
at this potential rate of expenditure  and at a presently estimated to percent market share of the asbestos abatement markets served by the company  the current and intermediate term effects of the diminishing market are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company based on its historical ability to increase its share of this market 
sales to the hazardous materials remediation  industrial safety and construction tools supply markets are increasing both in absolute amounts and as a percentage of revenues to the company 
the company plans to expand its customer base in these areas through additional salespeople and expects these revenues to increase at a faster rate than the asbestos abatement revenues 
in addition  using the company s financial strength to expand geographically  it has diversified its geographical risk allowing the company to better serve its regional and national customers

this transaction terminated the company s lease obligation and enabled the company to reverse all remaining reserves resulting in the special credit and earnings from discontinued operations during other expense  net  of  in increased percent over expense of  this increase is primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from higher borrowings on the company s working capital line of credit to fund the growth in receivables and inventory 
since the company s lines of credit are tied to the prime rate  any increases in the prime rate would negatively affect the company s earnings

per share in the percent increase in net earnings is due to the growth in revenues and product margins  and the losses recorded in related to the discontinuance of the sorbent manufacturing business  partially offset by the charge in to close the corpus christi branch office 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital requirements historically result from the growth of its accounts receivable and inventories  offset by increased accounts payable and accrued expenses  associated with increases in sales volume and the addition of new locations 
net cash used in operations during of  resulted principally from increases in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of the revenue growth 
operating cash flow was also impacted by more timely payments causing lower accrued expenses and payables 
a non cash charge to earnings for depreciation of  partially offset the cash used in operations 
cash requirements for non operating activities during resulted primarily from the repurchase of the company s common stock totaling  and purchases of property and equipment amounting to  the equipment purchases in were primarily computer and telecommunications equipment  office furniture and delivery trucks 
the company repurchased its common stock because of the board of directors belief that it was undervalued in the marketplace 
the board of directors has committed to continue purchases in the marketplace as long as the common stock remains undervalued 
the repurchase of common stock and purchases of property and equipment were funded by borrowings on the company s working lines of credit 
cash flow from operations for the entire year of is expected to be break even  although at any given point  it may be negative 
several factors contribute to this expectation 
the rate of revenue growth in is expected to be lower than and at a level that will not generate significant net cash flows from operations 
capital expenditures for are expected to be less than  since the company significantly improved its computer system in the company currently has no plans to expand geographically in  however  the company will continue to search for geographic locations that would complement the existing infrastructure 
if another location were to be opened in  the company would fund the startup expenses through its lines of credit 
anticipated cash requirements in will be satisfied from operations and borrowings on the lines of credit  as required 
the company maintains a  working capital line of credit at a commercial lending institution that allows the company to borrow up to percent of the book value of eligible trade receivables plus the lesser of percent of eligible inventory or  as of february   there are advances outstanding under this credit facility of  based on the borrowing formula  the company had the capacity to borrow an additional  as of february  the company also maintains a  capital equipment credit facility providing for borrowings at percent of cost on purchases 
the advances outstanding under this credit facility as of february  were  both credit facilities are payable on demand and bear a variable rate of interest computed at the prime rate plus one half of one percent 
management believes  that based on its equity position  the company s current credit facilities can be expanded during the next twelve months  if necessary  and that these facilities  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient for its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this form k are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following federal funding of environmental related projects  general economic and commercial real estate conditions in the local markets  inability to pass on price increases to customers  unavailability of products  strong competition and loss of key personnel
